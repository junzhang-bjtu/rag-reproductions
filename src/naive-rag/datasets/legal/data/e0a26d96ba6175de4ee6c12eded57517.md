CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES

 

Section 2.01 Conveyance of Receivables. In consideration of the Issuer’s
delivery to or upon the order of the Depositor of cash, the Certificates and
such other amounts to be distributed to the Depositor on the Closing Date, the
Depositor does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to
the Issuer, without recourse (subject to the obligations of the Depositor set
forth herein), all right, title and interest of the Depositor in and to:

 

(a)               the Receivables and all moneys identified thereon after the
Cutoff Date;

 

(b)              the security interests in the Financed Vehicles and any
accessions thereto granted by Obligors pursuant to the Receivables and any other
interest of the Depositor in such Financed Vehicles;

 

(c)              any Liquidation Proceeds and any other proceeds from claims on
any physical damage, credit, life or disability insurance policies covering the
Financed Vehicles or the related Obligors, including any vendor’s single
interest or other collateral protection insurance policy;

 

(d)              any property that shall have secured a Receivable and shall
have been acquired by or on behalf of the Depositor, the Servicer or the Trust;

 

(e)              all documents and other items contained in the Receivable
Files;

 

(f)               all of the Depositor’s rights (but not its obligations) under
the Receivables Purchase Agreement;

 

(g)              all right, title and interest in the Trust Accounts and all
funds, securities or other assets credited from time to time to the Trust
Accounts and in all investments therein and proceeds thereof (including all
Investment Earnings with respect to the Reserve Account and the initial Reserve
Account Deposit);

 



 2 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

(h)               any proceeds from any Receivable repurchased by a Dealer
pursuant to a Dealer Agreement; and

 

(i)                the proceeds of any and all of the foregoing (collectively,
with the assets listed in clauses (a) through (h) above, the “Conveyed Assets”).

 

The Depositor and the Issuer agree that the purchase price for the Conveyed
Assets sold by the Depositor to the Issuer represents fair market value for the
Conveyed Assets. It is the intention of the Depositor that the transfer and
assignment contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a sale of the
Conveyed Assets from the Depositor to the Trust and the beneficial interest in
and title to the Receivables and the related property shall not be part of the
Depositor’s estate in the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or
against the Depositor under any bankruptcy law. In the event that,
notwithstanding the intent of the Depositor, the transfer and assignment
contemplated hereby is held not to be a sale or is otherwise not effective to
sell the Conveyed Assets, this Agreement shall constitute a grant by the
Depositor to the Issuer of a security interest in all Conveyed Assets and all
accounts, money, chattel paper, securities, instruments, documents, deposit
accounts, uncertificated securities, general intangibles, contract rights, goods
and other property consisting of, arising from or relating to such Conveyed
Assets, for the benefit of the Securityholders.

 

ARTICLE III.

THE RECEIVABLES

 

Section 3.01 Representations and Warranties of the Seller.

 

(a)               The Seller has made each of the representations and warranties
set forth in Exhibit A to the Receivables Purchase Agreement as to the
Receivables and has consented to the assignment by the Depositor to the Issuer
of the Depositor’s rights with respect thereto. Such representations and
warranties speak as of the respective dates set forth therein, but shall survive
the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables to the Issuer and the
pledge of such Receivables to the Indenture Trustee. Pursuant to Section 2.01 of
this Agreement, the Depositor has sold, assigned, transferred and conveyed to
the Issuer, as part of the assets of the Issuer, its rights under the
Receivables Purchase Agreement, including the representations and warranties of
the Seller therein as set forth in Exhibit A to the Receivables Purchase
Agreement as to the Receivables, upon which representations and warranties the
Issuer relies in accepting the Receivables and delivering the Securities,
together with all rights of the Depositor with respect to any breach thereof,
including the right to require the Seller to repurchase Receivables in
accordance with the Receivables Purchase Agreement. It is understood and agreed
that the representations and warranties referred to in this Section shall
survive the sale and delivery of the Receivables to the Issuer.

 

(b)               The Seller hereby agrees that the Issuer shall have the right
to enforce any and all rights under the Receivables Purchase Agreement assigned
to the Issuer herein, including the right to cause the Seller to repurchase any
Receivable with respect to which it is in breach of any of its representations
and warranties set forth in Exhibit A to the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
directly against the Seller as though the Issuer were a party to the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, and the Issuer shall not be obligated to exercise any such
rights indirectly through the Depositor.

 



 3 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 3.02 Perfection Representations and Warranties. If the transfer of the
Conveyed Assets under this Agreement is determined to be a pledge relating to a
financing or is determined not to be an absolute sale and assignment, the
Depositor makes the following representations and warranties on which the Issuer
is relying in purchasing the Conveyed Assets.  The representations and
warranties are made as of the Closing Date, but shall survive the sale, transfer
and assignment of the Conveyed Assets by the Depositor to the Issuer and the
pledge thereof to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture:

 

(a)               This Agreement creates a valid and continuing security
interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Conveyed Assets in favor of
the Issuer, which security interest is prior to all other Liens other than
Permitted Liens and any Lien that will be released prior to the assignment
hereunder, and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from
the Depositor.

 

(b)               Each Receivable constitutes either “tangible chattel paper” or
“electronic chattel paper” within the meaning of the UCC as in effect in the
state of origination.

 

(c)               Immediately upon the transfer thereof from the Depositor to
the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement, the Issuer shall have good and marketable
title to each Receivable, free and clear of any Liens other than permitted liens
and any Lien that will be released prior to the assignment hereunder.

 

(d)               The Depositor has caused, or will have caused, within ten days
of the Closing Date, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the
proper filing office in the appropriate jurisdiction under the applicable UCC in
order to perfect the security interest in the Conveyed Assets granted to the
Issuer under this Agreement.

 

(e)               Other than the security interest granted to the Issuer
pursuant to this Agreement, the Depositor has not pledged, assigned, sold,
granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables.
The Depositor has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing
statements against the Depositor that include a description of collateral
describing the Receivables other than any financing statement relating to the
security interest granted to the Issuer under this Agreement. The Depositor is
not aware of any judgment or tax lien filings against the Depositor.

 

(f)                The Contracts that constitute or evidence the Receivables do
not have any marks or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned
or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Issuer, except for such marks
or notations indicating that they have been pledged, assigned or otherwise
conveyed (i) to the Depositor or the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the
Basic Documents or (ii) to HCA in accordance with Dealer Agreements. All
financing statements filed or to be filed against the Depositor in favor of the
Issuer in connection with this Agreement describing the Receivables contain a
statement to the following effect: “A purchase of or security interest in any
collateral described in this financing statement, except as provided in the Sale
and Servicing Agreement, will violate the rights of the Issuer.”

 

Section 3.03 Repurchase upon Breach. If the Seller discovers, or is notified by
a Requesting Party with a Repurchase Request regarding, a breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02(b) to the Receivables
Purchase Agreement at the time such representations and warranties were made,
the Seller will investigate the Receivable to confirm the breach and determine
if the breach triggers a Repurchase Event. Following a Repurchase Event, the
Seller shall either (a) correct or cure such breach or (b) purchase any
Receivable materially and adversely affected by such breach from the Issuer, in
either case on or before the Payment Date following the end of the Collection
Period which includes the 60th day (or, if the Seller elects, an earlier Payment
Date) after the date that the Seller became aware of or was notified of and
confirmed such breach. Any such breach or failure will be deemed not to
materially and adversely affect the Noteholders or the Issuer if such breach or
failure does not affect the ability of the Issuer or the Noteholders to receive
and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any such purchase by the
Seller shall be at a price equal to the Purchased Amount. In consideration for
such repurchase, the Seller shall make (or shall cause to be made) a payment to
the Issuer equal to the Purchased Amount by depositing such amount into the
Collection Account in accordance with Section 5.04 on the Business Day preceding
the Payment Date of repurchase (or, if the Seller elects, an earlier Payment
Date). Upon payment of such Purchased Amount by the Seller, the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee shall release and shall execute and deliver such instruments
of release, transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or
representation, as shall be reasonably necessary to vest in the Seller or its
designee any Receivable repurchased pursuant hereto. It is understood and agreed
that the right to cause the Seller to purchase (or to enforce the obligations of
Seller under the Receivables Purchase Agreement to purchase) any Receivable as
described above shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such breach
available to the Issuer, the Noteholders, the Owner Trustee, the
Certificateholders and the Indenture Trustee. Neither the Owner Trustee nor the
Indenture Trustee will have any duty to conduct an affirmative investigation as
to the occurrence of any condition requiring the repurchase of any Receivable
pursuant to this Section 3.03.

ARTICLE IV.

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF RECEIVABLES

 

Section 4.01 Duties of Servicer. The Servicer, for the benefit of the Issuer and
the Indenture Trustee, shall manage, service, administer and make collections on
the Receivables and perform the other actions required of the Servicer under
this Agreement. The Servicer shall service the Receivables in accordance with
its customary servicing practices, using the degree of skill and attention that
the Servicer exercises with respect to all other comparable motor vehicle
receivables that it services for itself and others. The Servicer’s duties shall
include the collection and posting of all payments, responding to inquiries of
Obligors, investigating delinquencies, sending payment statements to Obligors,
reporting any required tax information to Obligors, monitoring the Collateral,
accounting for collections, furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee with respect to distributions and
performing the other duties specified herein. The Servicer also shall administer
and enforce all rights of the holder of the Receivables under the Receivables
and the Dealer Agreements to the extent and in a manner consistent with its
customary practices. To the extent consistent with the standards, policies and
procedures otherwise required hereby and the Credit and Collection Policy, the
Servicer shall follow its customary standards, policies and procedures and shall
have full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in
connection with the managing, servicing, administration and collection of the
Receivables that it may deem necessary or desirable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 4.02, the Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Certificateholders and the
Noteholders, or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other
comparable instruments with respect to the Receivables and with respect to the
Financed Vehicles. The Servicer is not required under the Basic Documents to
make any disbursements via wire transfer or otherwise on behalf of an Obligor.
There are no requirements under the Receivable or the Basic Documents for funds
to be, and no funds shall be, held in trust for an Obligor. No payments or
disbursements shall be made by the Servicer on behalf of an Obligor. The
Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own name or in the name of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Certificateholders or the
Noteholders, a legal proceeding to enforce a Receivable pursuant to Section 4.03
or to commence or participate in any other legal proceeding (including a
bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a Receivable, an Obligor or a
Financed Vehicle. If the Servicer commences or participates in any such legal
proceeding in its own name, the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer shall thereupon
be deemed to have automatically assigned the applicable Receivable to the
Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or participating in such proceeding
as a party or claimant, and the Servicer is authorized and empowered by the
Indenture Trustee or the Issuer to execute and deliver in the Indenture
Trustee’s or the Issuer’s name any notices, demands, claims, complaints,
responses, affidavits or other documents or instruments in connection with any
such proceeding. If in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall be held
that the Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on the ground that it shall not
be a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce such Receivable, the
Owner Trustee shall, at the Servicer’s expense and direction, take steps to
enforce such Receivable, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Certificateholders or the Noteholders. The
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall upon the written request of the
Servicer furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents
reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its
servicing and administrative duties hereunder. The Servicer shall include the
disclosures required by Rule 4(c)(2)(ii) contained in Regulation RR, 17 C.F.R.
§246.4, et seq. in the first Servicer’s Certificate after the Closing Date.

 



 5 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 4.02 Collection of Receivable Payments; Modifications of Receivables.

 

(a)               Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures
required by this Agreement, the Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to
collect all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the
Receivables as and when the same shall become due, and shall follow such
collection procedures as it follows with respect to all comparable motor vehicle
receivables that it services for itself or others. The Servicer is authorized in
its discretion to waive any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other
similar fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing any
Receivable.

 

(b)               Subject to Section 4.06, the Servicer may grant extensions,
rebates, deferrals, amendments, modifications or adjustments on a Receivable in
accordance with its customary servicing practices; provided, however, that if
the Servicer (i) extends the date for final payment by the Obligor of any
Receivable beyond the last day of the Collection Period prior to the Class C
Stated Maturity Date or (ii) reduces the APR or unpaid principal balance with
respect to any Receivable other than as required by applicable law, it will
promptly purchase such Receivable in the manner provided in Section 4.07.

 



 6 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

(c)               The Servicer may, but is not required to, make any advances of
funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions. Payments
on the Receivables, including payoffs made in accordance with the related
documentation for such Receivables, shall be posted to the Servicer’s Obligor
records in accordance with the principal, interest or other items in accordance
with the related documentation for such Receivables.

 

(d)               Subject to the provisions of Section 4.02(b), the Servicer and
its Affiliates may engage in any marketing practice or promotion or any sale of
any products, goods or services to Obligors with respect to the Receivables so
long as such practices, promotions or sales are offered to obligors of
comparable motor vehicle receivables serviced by the Servicer for itself and
others, whether or not such practices, promotions or sales might result in a
decrease in the aggregate amount of payments on the Receivables, prepayments or
faster or slower timing of the payment of the Receivables.

 

(e)               Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Servicer may refinance any Receivable and deposit the full Principal Balance
of such Receivable into the Collection Account. The receivable created by such
refinancing shall not be property of the Issuer. The Servicer and its Affiliates
may also sell insurance or debt cancellation products, including products which
result in the cancellation of some or all of the amount of a Receivable upon the
death or disability of the Obligor or any casualty with respect to the Financed
Vehicle.

 

(f)                Records documenting collection efforts shall be maintained
during the period a Receivable is delinquent in accordance with the Credit and
Collection Policy. Such records shall be maintained on at least a periodic basis
that is not less frequent than as set forth in the Credit and Collection Policy,
and describe the entity’s activities in monitoring delinquent pool assets
including, for example, phone calls, letters and payment rescheduling plans in
cases where delinquency is deemed temporary (e.g., illness or unemployment) in
accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.

 

Section 4.03 Realization upon Receivables. Consistent with the standards,
policies and procedures required by this Agreement and the Credit and Collection
Policy, the Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to repossess or otherwise
convert the ownership of and liquidate any Financed Vehicle securing a
Receivable with respect to which the Servicer shall have determined that
eventual payment in full is unlikely; provided, however, that the Servicer may
elect not to repossess a Financed Vehicle if in its good faith judgment it
determines that the proceeds ultimately recoverable with respect to such
Receivable would not be greater than the expense of such repossession. In
repossessing or otherwise converting the ownership of a Financed Vehicle and
liquidating a Receivable, the Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable, consistent
with the standard of care required by Section 4.01, which practices and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to
Dealers, the sale of the related Financed Vehicle at public or private sale, the
submission of claims under an insurance policy and other actions by the Servicer
in order to realize upon a Receivable; provided, however, that in any case in
which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not
expend funds in connection with any repair or towards the repossession of such
Financed Vehicle unless it shall determine in its reasonable judgment that such
repair or repossession shall increase the related Liquidation Proceeds by an
amount materially greater than the expense for such repair or repossession. The
Servicer shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses incurred by it in
the course of repossessing and liquidating a Financed Vehicle into cash
proceeds, but only out of the cash proceeds of the sale of such Financed
Vehicle, any deficiency obtained from the related Obligor or any amounts
received from recourse to the related Dealer.

 



 7 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 4.04 [Reserved].

 

Section 4.05 Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary servicing procedures, take such
steps as are necessary to maintain perfection of the security interest created
by each Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The provisions set forth in
this Section are the sole requirements under the Basic Documents with respect to
the maintenance of collateral or security on the Receivables. It is understood
that the Financed Vehicles are the collateral and security for the Receivables,
but that the certificate of title with respect to a Financed Vehicle does not
constitute collateral and merely evidences such security interest. The Servicer
is hereby authorized to take such steps as are necessary to re-perfect such
security interest on behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in the event
of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle, or for any other reason. In the event
that the assignment of a Receivable to the Issuer is insufficient, without a
notation on the related Financed Vehicle’s certificate of title, or without
fulfilling any additional administrative requirements under the laws of the
state in which such Financed Vehicle is located, to perfect a security interest
in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Issuer, the Servicer hereby
agrees that the designation of HCA as the secured party on the certificate of
title is in its capacity as agent of the Issuer.

 

Section 4.06 Covenants of Servicer. By its execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Servicer hereby covenants as follows (upon which covenants the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee rely in accepting the
Receivables and delivering the applicable Securities):

 

(a)               Liens in Force. The Servicer will not release the Financed
Vehicle securing any Receivable from the security interest granted by such
Receivable in whole or in part except (i) in the event of payment in full by or
on behalf of the Obligor thereunder or payment in full less a deficiency which
the Servicer would not attempt to collect in accordance with its customary
servicing practices, (ii) in connection with repossession and sale of the
Financed Vehicle or (iii) as may be required by an insurer in order to receive
proceeds from any Insurance Policy covering such Financed Vehicle;

 

(b)               No Impairment. The Servicer shall do nothing to impair the
rights of the Trust in the property of the Trust;

 

(c)               No Amendments. The Servicer shall (i) not extend the date for
final payment by the Obligor of any Receivable beyond the last day of the
Collection Period prior to the Class C Stated Maturity Date; or (ii) reduce the
APR or unpaid principal balance with respect to any Receivable other than as
required by applicable law.

 



 8 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

(d)               Safekeeping. The Servicer, in its capacity as custodian, shall
hold, or cause its agent to hold, the Receivable Files for the benefit of the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in accordance with its customary servicing
practices. For the avoidance of doubt, the Servicer may, in accordance with its
customary servicing practices, (i) maintain all or a portion of the Receivable
Files in electronic form and (ii) maintain custody of all or any portion of the
Receivable Files with one or more of its agents or designees.

 

Section 4.07 Purchase of Receivables Upon Breach. Upon discovery by any party
hereto of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 4.02, 4.03, 4.05
or 4.06 which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or
the Noteholders, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written
notice thereof to the other parties hereto; provided, that delivery of a
Servicer’s Certificate shall be deemed to constitute prompt written notice
thereof to the other party; provided, further, that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect any obligation of the Servicer under this Section 4.07.
Following a breach described in the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall
either (a) correct or cure such breach or (b) purchase any Receivable materially
and adversely affected by such breach from the Issuer, in either case on or
before the Payment Date following the end of the Collection Period which
includes the 60th day (or, if the Servicer elects, an earlier Payment Date)
after the date that the Servicer became aware or was notified of such breach.
Any such breach or failure will be deemed not to materially and adversely affect
the Noteholders or the Issuer if such breach or failure does not affect the
ability of the Issuer or the Noteholders to receive and retain timely payment in
full on such Receivable. Any such purchase by the Servicer shall be at a price
equal to the Purchased Amount. In consideration for such repurchase, the
Servicer shall make (or shall cause to be made) a payment to the Issuer equal to
the Purchased Amount by depositing such amount into the Collection Account in
accordance with Section 5.04 on the Business Day preceding such Payment Date
(or, if the Servicer elects, an earlier Payment Date). Upon payment of such
Purchased Amount by the Servicer, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall
release and shall execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer or
assignment, in each case without recourse or representation, as shall be
reasonably necessary to vest in the Servicer or its designee any Receivable
repurchased pursuant hereto. It is understood and agreed that the obligation of
the Servicer to purchase any Receivable as described above shall constitute the
sole remedy respecting such breach available to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee,
the Certificateholders, the Noteholders and the Indenture Trustee.

 

Section 4.08 Servicing Fee. The Servicing Fee shall be payable to the Servicer
on each Payment Date. The Servicing Fee shall be calculated on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. In addition, the Servicer will
be entitled to retain all late fees, extension fees, non-sufficient funds
charges and any and all other administrative fees and expenses or similar
charges allowed by applicable law with respect to any Receivable. The Servicer
also will be entitled to receive Investment Earnings on amounts on deposit in
the Collection Account during each Collection Period. The Servicer shall be
required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities
under this Agreement (including taxes imposed on the Servicer and expenses
incurred in connection with distributions and reports made by the Servicer to
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee). The Servicer shall be required to
pay all of the Indenture Trustee’s fees, expenses, reimbursements and
indemnifications.

 

Section 4.09 Servicer’s Certificate. The Servicer shall prepare and deliver to
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, and the Depositor, with a copy to each
Rating Agency, on or before the second Business Day prior to each Payment Date a
Servicer’s Certificate containing all information necessary to make the
distributions to be made on the related Payment Date pursuant to Section 5.05
for the related Collection Period and such Servicer’s Certificate shall be
certified by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer to the effect that the
information provided is complete and no Servicer Termination Events have
occurred. If any defaults have occurred, such Servicer’s Certificate will
provide an explanation of such Servicer Termination Events. At the sole option
of the Servicer, each Servicer’s Certificate may be delivered in electronic or
hard copy format. Such Servicer’s Certificate as described in this section shall
be in substantially the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B.

Section 4.10 Annual Statement as to Compliance, Notice of Servicer Termination
Event.

 

(a)               The Servicer shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, and each Rating Agency, within 120 days after the end of the Servicer’s
fiscal year (or, in the case of the first such certificate, not later than April
30, 2021), an Officer’s Certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Servicer, stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the
preceding 12-month period (or such shorter period in the case of the first such
Officer’s Certificate) and of the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement has been made under such officer’s supervision and (ii) to such
officer’s knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its
obligations under this Agreement throughout such period or, if there has been a
default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default
known to such officer and the nature and status thereof.

 

(b)               The Servicer shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, and each Rating Agency, promptly after having obtained knowledge
thereof, written notice in an Officer’s Certificate of any event that with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become a Servicer Termination
Event under Section 8.01. Except to the extent set forth in this Section 4.10(b)
and Sections 4.09 and 8.04 of this Agreement and Sections 3.07, 3.19 and 5.01 of
the Indenture, the Basic Documents do not require any policies or procedures to
monitor any performance or other triggers and events of default.

 

Section 4.11 Compliance with Regulation AB. The Servicer agrees to perform all
duties and obligations applicable to or required of the Issuer set forth in
Appendix B attached hereto and made a part hereof in all respects and makes the
representations and warranties therein applicable to it.

 

Section 4.12 Access to Certain Documentation and Information Regarding
Receivables. The Servicer shall provide to representatives of the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and the Certificateholders reasonable access to the
documentation regarding the Receivables and the related Trust property. The
Servicer will provide such access to any Noteholder only in such cases where the
Servicer shall be required by applicable statutes or regulations to permit a
Noteholder to review such documentation. In each case, access shall be afforded
without charge, but only upon reasonable request and during the normal business
hours at the offices of the Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall affect the
obligation of the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure
of information regarding the Obligors and the failure of the Servicer to provide
access to information as a result of such obligation shall not constitute a
breach of this Section.

 



 10 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 4.13 Term of Servicer. The Servicer hereby covenants and agrees to act
as Servicer under, and for the term of, this Agreement, subject to the
provisions of Sections 7.03 and 7.06.

 

Section 4.14 Annual Independent Accountants’ Report. For so long as the Issuer
is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, the Servicer
shall cause a firm of independent certified public accountants, which may also
render other services to the Servicer or its Affiliates, to deliver to the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, and each Rating Agency, within 120 days after
the end of each fiscal year (or, in the case of the first such report, not later
than April 30, 2021), a report addressed to the Board of Directors of the
Servicer, the Owner Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee, to the effect that such

regulations of the Commission thereunder. The Depositor shall, at its expense,
cooperate in any reasonable request made by the Servicer in connection with such
filings.

co-trustee appointed pursuant to Section 6.11 of the Indenture (a “Separate
Trustee”)) from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered
by the Indenture Trustee or Separate Trustee, as the case may be, under the
Indenture (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

 

(b)               except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture,
reimburse the Indenture Trustee or any Separate Trustee upon its request for all

disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith;

 

(c)               indemnify the Indenture Trustee and any Separate Trustee and

(a)               (i) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall
establish, or cause to be established, an account with and in the name of the
Indenture Trustee (the “Collection Account”), which shall be maintained as an
Eligible Account and shall bear a designation clearly indicating that the
amounts deposited thereto are held for the benefit of the Noteholders.

 

(ii) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall establish and maintain,
or cause to be established and maintained, for the benefit of the Issuer and the
Noteholders an Eligible Account (the “Reserve Account”), bearing a designation
clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held in trust for the
benefit of the Issuer and the Noteholders.

 

(iii) Funds on deposit in the Reserve Account, shall be invested by the
Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments selected in writing by the Servicer;
provided, however, that if the Servicer fails to select any Eligible Investment
for any funds on deposit in the Reserve Account by 2:00 p.m., New York City time
(or such other time as may be agreed by the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee),
on any Business Day, such funds shall, to the fullest extent practicable, be
invested in Eligible Investments in accordance with standing instructions most
recently given by the Servicer.  All such Eligible Investments shall be held by
the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders, the Certificateholders
and the Issuer.  Unless the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied (other than
with respect to S&P, but with satisfaction of the Rating Agency Notification
with respect to S&P if S&P is rating any Outstanding Class of Notes) with
respect to different investments, funds on deposit in the Reserve Account shall
be invested in Eligible Investments that will mature so that such funds will be
available on the Business Day preceding the next Payment Date.  Funds deposited
in the Reserve Account, upon the maturity of any Eligible Investments on a day
which immediately precedes a Payment Date, are not required to be invested
overnight.

 

(iv)  Funds on deposit in the Collection Account shall be invested by the
Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments selected in writing by the Servicer;
provided, however, that if the Servicer fails to select any Eligible Investments

Trustee), on any Business Day, such funds shall, to the fullest extent
practicable, be invested in Eligible Investments in accordance with standing
instructions most recently given by the Servicer.  All such Eligible Investments
shall be held by the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and/or
the Certificateholders, as applicable.  Unless the Rating Agency Condition is
satisfied (other than with respect to S&P, but with satisfaction of the Rating
Agency Notification with respect to S&P if S&P is rating any Outstanding Class
of Notes) with respect to different investments, funds on deposit in the
Collection Account shall be invested in Eligible Investments that will mature so
that such funds will be available on the Business Day preceding the next Payment
Date.  Investment Earnings on amounts on deposit in the Collection Account, net
of losses and investment expenses, shall be released to the Servicer on each
Payment Date and shall be the property of the Servicer.

(v) Except as otherwise provided hereunder or agreed in writing among the
parties hereto, the Servicer shall retain the authority to institute,
participate and join in any plan of reorganization, readjustment, merger or
consolidation with respect to the issuer of any securities held in the
Collection Account or the Reserve Account, and, in general, to exercise each and
every other power or right with respect to each such asset or investment as
individuals generally have and enjoy with respect to their own assets and
investment, including power to vote upon any securities.

 

(b)               (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Indenture Trustee
shall possess all right, title and interest in all funds identified and all
funds on deposit from time to time in the Trust Accounts and in all proceeds
thereof. The Trust Accounts (other than the Reserve Account) shall be under the
sole dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
Noteholders and the Certificateholders, as the case may be. The Reserve Account
shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Indenture Trustee for the
benefit of the Issuer, which such Reserve Account has been pledged by the Issuer
to the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders. If, at any time, a
Trust Account ceases to be an Eligible Account, the Indenture Trustee (or the
Servicer on its behalf) shall within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer
period, not to exceed 15 calendar days, as to which the Rating Agency Condition
is satisfied (other than with respect to S&P, but with satisfaction of the
Rating Agency Notification with respect to S&P if S&P is rating any Outstanding
Class of Notes)) establish a new Trust Account as an Eligible Account and shall
transfer any cash or any investments from the account that is no longer an
Eligible Account to the Trust Account. Neither the Servicer nor the Indenture
Trustee shall in any way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in any
Trust Account resulting from any investment loss in any Eligible Investment.

 

(ii) The Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the Indenture Trustee or by
the Owner Trustee with the consent of the Indenture Trustee, to instruct the
Indenture Trustee in writing to make withdrawals and payments from the Trust
Accounts and the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of withdrawing
any amounts deposited in error into such accounts.

Certificate Distribution Account, there are no accounts required to be
maintained under the Basic Documents. No checks shall be issued, printed or
honored with respect to the Collection Account or the Reserve Account.

 

Section 5.02 Application of Collections. All payments identified from or on
behalf of an Obligor during each Collection Period with respect to each
Receivable (other than a Purchased Receivable) shall be applied to interest and
principal in accordance with the Simple Interest Method. The Servicer shall make
all deposits of Collections and other Available Amounts identified into the
Collection Account on the second Business Day following identification thereof.
However, so long as the Monthly Remittance Condition is satisfied, the Servicer
may retain such amounts identified during a Collection Period until one Business
Day prior to the related Payment Date. The “Monthly Remittance Condition” shall
be deemed to be satisfied if (i) HCA or one of its Affiliates is the Servicer,
(ii) no Servicer Termination Event has occurred and is continuing and (iii) HCA
has a short-term debt rating of at least “F1” from Fitch and “A-1” from S&P.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer may remit Collections to the
Collection Account on any other alternate remittance schedule (but not later
than the Business Day prior to the related Payment Date) if the Rating Agency
Condition is satisfied (other than with respect to S&P, but with satisfaction of
the Rating Agency Notification with respect to S&P if S&P is rating any
Outstanding Class of Notes), with respect to such alternate remittance schedule.
Pending deposit into the Collection Account, Collections may be commingled and
used by the Servicer at its own risk and are not required to be segregated from
its own funds.

 

Section 5.03 Property of the Trust. All payments and other proceeds of any type
and from any source on or with respect to the Receivables shall be the property

respect to Purchased Receivables and the Servicer shall deposit therein all
amounts to be paid under Section 4.07. All such deposits with respect to any
such date which is a Payment Date shall be made in immediately available funds
on or before the Business Day preceding such Payment Date. The Servicer shall
deposit or cause to be deposited into the Collection Account, on the date
specified in Section 9.01, (i) the aggregate Purchased Amount with respect to
all Receivables pursuant to the Servicer’s exercise of the Optional Purchase,
less (ii) the amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account on the date of such

or before the second Business Day prior to each Payment Date pursuant to Section
4.09) to make distributions from Available Amounts on deposit in the Collection
Account, including amounts deposited pursuant to Section 5.06(b) and (c), in the

ARTICLE VI.


THE DEPOSITOR

 

Section 6.01 Representations of Depositor. The Depositor makes the following
representations on which the Issuer relies in accepting the Receivables and
delivering the Securities. Such representations speak as of the Closing Date and
shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables by the
Depositor to the Issuer and the subsequent pledge thereof to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

 

(a)               Organization and Good Standing. The Depositor has been duly
organized and is validly existing as a limited liability company in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the power and authority
to own its properties and to conduct its business as such properties are
currently owned and such business is presently conducted.

 

(b)               Due Qualification. The Depositor is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign limited liability company in good standing, and has
obtained all necessary licenses and approvals, in all jurisdictions where the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
the Depositor’s ability to transfer the Receivables to the Trust pursuant to
this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the Receivables.

 

(c)               Power and Authority. The Depositor has the power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it
is a party and to carry out their respective terms; the Depositor has full power
and authority to sell and assign the property to be sold and assigned to and
deposited with the Issuer, and the Depositor shall have duly authorized such
sale and assignment to the Issuer by all necessary limited liability company
action; and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
other Basic Documents to which the Depositor is a party have been and will be
duly authorized by the Depositor by all necessary limited liability company
action.

 

(d)               No Violation. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which the
Depositor is a party and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
and the other Basic Documents do not conflict with, result in any breach of any
of the terms or provisions of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) a default under, the limited liability company agreement of the
Depositor, or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the
Depositor is a party or by which it is bound, or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any
such indenture, agreement or other instrument (other than this Agreement and the
other Basic Documents), or violate any law or, to the Depositor’s knowledge any
order, rule or regulation applicable to the Depositor of any court or of any
federal or state regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental
instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Depositor or its properties. There
shall be no breach of the representations and warranties in this paragraph
resulting from any of the foregoing breaches, violations, Liens or other matters
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely
affect the Depositor’s ability to perform its obligations under the Basic
Documents or the consummation of the transactions as contemplated by the Basic
Documents.

properties: (i) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or any other Basic
Document; (ii) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Notes or the Certificates

title and interest of the Depositor in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.
The Receivables will not be considered part of the Depositor’s estate in the
event of a bankruptcy of the Depositor. This Agreement and the other Basic
Documents to which the Depositor is a party, when duly executed and delivered by
the other parties hereto and thereto, shall constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Depositor, enforceable against the Depositor in accordance
with their respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general

(g)               No Consents. The Depositor is not required to obtain the
consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval, registration,
authorization, or declaration of or with any governmental authority, bureau or

Depositor contemplate any pending insolvency.

 

Section 6.02 Company Existence. During the term of this Agreement, the Depositor
will keep in full force and effect its existence, rights and franchises under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and will obtain and preserve its
qualification to do business in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so
qualified would materially and adversely affect the validity and enforceability
of this Agreement, the Basic Documents, the proper administration of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all transactions
and dealings between the Depositor and its Affiliates will be conducted on an
arm’s-length basis.

(b)               The Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee, by entering into or accepting this Agreement, acknowledge and agree
that they have no right, title or interest in or to the Other Assets of the

contained in the preceding sentence, the Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee either (i) asserts an interest or claim to, or
benefit from, Other Assets, or (ii) is deemed to have any such interest, claim
to, or benefit in or from Other Assets, whether by operation of law, legal
process, pursuant to applicable provisions of insolvency laws or otherwise
(including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any successor
provision having similar effect under the Bankruptcy Code), then the Issuer, the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee further acknowledges and
agrees that any such interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and
will be expressly subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full, which, under
the terms of the relevant documents relating to the securitization or conveyance
of such Other Assets, are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of,
or otherwise secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such entitlement
or security interest is legally perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority of
distributions or application under applicable law, including insolvency laws,
and whether or not asserted against the Depositor), including the payment of
post-petition interest on such other obligations and liabilities. This
subordination agreement will be deemed a subordination agreement within the
meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Issuer, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee each further acknowledges and agrees
that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of this Section 6.03(b) and
the terms of this Section 6.03(b) may be enforced by an action for specific
performance. The provisions of this Section 6.03(b) will be for the third party
benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and will survive the termination of
this Agreement.

Depositor. Any Person (a) into which the Depositor may be merged or
consolidated, (b) resulting from any merger, conversion, or consolidation to
which the Depositor is a party, (c) succeeding to the business of the Depositor,
or (d) more than 50% of the voting stock or voting power and 50% or more of the
economic equity of which is owned directly or indirectly by any affiliate of
HCA, which Person in any of the foregoing cases executes an agreement of
assumption to perform every obligation of the Depositor under this Agreement,
will be the successor to the Depositor under this Agreement without the
execution or filing of any document or any further act on the part of any of the
parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Depositor
enters into any of the foregoing transactions and is not the surviving entity,
(x) the Depositor shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such merger, conversion,
consolidation or succession and such agreement of assumption comply with this
Section 6.04 and that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this
Agreement relating to such transaction have been complied with and (y) the
Depositor will deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either (A)
stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all financing statements and
continuation statements and amendments thereto have been executed and filed that
are necessary fully to preserve and protect the interest of the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee, respectively, in the Receivables, and reciting the details of
such filings, or (B) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, no such
action is necessary to preserve and protect such interest. It shall be a
condition precedent to any of the foregoing transactions that (1) the Rating
Agency Condition shall be satisfied (other than with respect to S&P, but with
satisfaction of the Rating Agency Notification with respect to S&P if S&P is
rating any Outstanding Class of Notes) with respect to such merger,
consolidation or succession shall not result in a reduction, withdrawal or
downgrade of the then-current rating of each class of Notes and (2) the
organizational documents of the surviving entity shall contain bankruptcy
remoteness protections that are not materially less favorable to the Noteholders
than those contained in the limited liability company agreement of the
Depositor.

Section 7.01 Representations of Servicer. The Servicer makes the following
representations upon which the Issuer is deemed to have relied in acquiring the

(b)               Due Qualification. The Servicer is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation in good standing, and has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals, in all jurisdictions where the failure to do

to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it

action.

 

(d)               No Violation. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it is a
party and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement do not
conflict with, result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under,
the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Servicer, or any indenture,
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument to which the Servicer is
a party or by which it is bound; or result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument (other than this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents), or violate any law or, to the
Servicer’s knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Servicer
of any court or federal or state regulatory body, administrative agency or other
governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Servicer or any of its
properties. There shall be no breach of the representations and warranties in
this paragraph resulting from any of the foregoing breaches, violations, Liens
or other matters which, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially
and adversely affect the Servicer’s ability to perform its obligations under the
Basic Documents.

 



 21 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

(e)               No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or investigations
pending or, to the Servicer’s knowledge, threatened in writing, against the

tribunal or governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Servicer
or its properties: (i) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or any of the
other Basic Documents; (ii) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Securities or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any of the other Basic Documents; (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that
would materially and adversely affect the performance by the Servicer of its
obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement or any
of the other Basic Documents; or (iv) seeking to adversely affect the federal
income tax or other federal, state or local tax attributes of the Securities.

 

(f)                Binding Obligation. This Agreement and the other Basic
Documents to which it is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Servicer, enforceable against the Servicer in accordance with their
respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and to general principles of equity
whether applied in a proceeding in equity or at law.

 

(g)               No Consents. The Servicer is not required to obtain the
consent of any other party or any consent, license, approval or authorization,
or registration or declaration with, any governmental authority, bureau or
agency in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
enforceability of this Agreement, other than (i) UCC filings and (ii) consents,
licenses, approvals, registrations, authorizations or declarations which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the enforceability
or collectibility of the Receivables or would not materially and adversely
affect the ability of the Servicer to perform its obligations under the Basic
Documents.

the extent of the obligations specifically undertaken by the Servicer and the

costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities arising out of or
resulting from the use, ownership or operation by the Servicer or any Affiliate
thereof of a Financed Vehicle, excluding any losses incurred in connection with

 22 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

(c)               The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor and their
respective officers, directors, agents and employees, and the Securityholders,
from and against any taxes that may at any time be asserted against any of such
parties with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
including any sales, gross receipts, tangible or intangible personal property,
privilege or license taxes (but not including any federal or other income taxes,
including franchise taxes asserted with respect to, and as of the date of, the
transfer of the Receivables to the Trust or the issuance and original sale of
the Securities), and any costs and expenses in defending against the same.

 

(d)               The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, and any of the officers,
directors, employees or agents of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, claims,
damages and liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim,
damage or liability arose out of, or was imposed upon any such Person through,
the negligence or willful misfeasance of the Servicer in the performance of its
duties or by failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement or by
reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.

 

(e)               The Servicer shall compensate and indemnify the Indenture
Trustee to the extent provided in Section 6.08 of the Indenture.

 

For purposes of this Section, in the event of the termination of the rights and
obligations of HCA (or any successor thereto pursuant to Section 7.03) as
Servicer pursuant to Section 8.02, or the resignation by such Servicer pursuant
to this Agreement, such Servicer shall be deemed to be the Servicer pending
appointment of a successor Servicer (other than the Indenture Trustee) pursuant
to Section 8.03.

 

Indemnification under this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Servicer or the termination of this Agreement, and shall include reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel and reasonable expenses of litigation, including,
without limitation, any legal fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any enforcement (including any action, claim or suit brought) of any
indemnification or other obligation of the Servicer). If the Servicer shall have
made any indemnity payments pursuant to this Section and the Person to or on
behalf of whom such payments are made thereafter collects any of such amounts
from others, such Person shall promptly repay such amounts to the Servicer,
without interest. The Servicer shall pay all amounts due, pursuant to this
Section, with respect to the Indenture Trustee and Owner Trustee as set forth in
Section 5.05(b)(xi).

 



 23 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 7.03 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of,
Servicer. The Servicer shall not merge or consolidate with any other Person,
convey, transfer or lease substantially all its assets as an entirety to another
Person, or permit any other Person to become the successor to the Servicer’s
business unless, after such merger, consolidation, conveyance, transfer, lease
or succession, the successor or surviving entity shall be capable of fulfilling
the duties of the Servicer contained in this Agreement. Any Person (a) into
which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, (b) resulting from any merger
or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, (c) that acquires by
conveyance, transfer or lease substantially all of the assets of the Servicer or
(d) succeeding to the business of the Servicer, which Person shall execute an
agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the Servicer under this
Agreement, shall be the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement without
the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of
the parties to this Agreement. The Servicer shall provide notice of any merger,
consolidation or succession pursuant to this Section 7.03 to the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee and each Rating Agency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Servicer shall not merge or consolidate with any other Person or permit any
other Person to become a successor to the Servicer’s business unless (a)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no representation or
warranty made pursuant to Section 7.01 shall have been breached (for purposes
hereof, such representations and warranties shall speak as of the date of the
consummation of such transaction) and no event that, after notice or lapse of
time or both, would become a Servicer Termination Event shall have occurred, (b)
the Servicer shall have delivered to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that such
consolidation, merger or succession and such agreement of assumption comply with
this Section 7.03 and that all conditions precedent provided for in this
Agreement relating to such transaction have been complied with and (c) the
Servicer shall have delivered to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel stating that either (i) all financing statements and
continuation statements and amendments thereto have been executed and filed that
are necessary to preserve and protect the interest of the Trust and the
Indenture Trustee, respectively, in the assets of the Trust and reciting the
details of such filings or (ii) no such action shall be necessary to preserve
and protect such interest.

Servicer or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be under
any liability to the Issuer, the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders, except as provided in this
Agreement, for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that this provision shall not
protect the Servicer or any such Person against any liability that would
otherwise be imposed by reason of a breach of this Agreement or willful
misfeasance or bad faith in the performance of duties. The Servicer and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Servicer may conclusively rely in
good faith on the written advice of counsel or on any document of any kind
prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising under this Agreement.

 

Section 7.05 Delegation of Duties. The Servicer may, at any time without notice
or consent, delegate (a) any or all of its duties (including, without
limitation, its duties as custodian) under the Basic Documents to any of its
Affiliates or (b) specific duties to sub-contractors who are in the business of
performing such duties; provided, that no such delegation shall relieve the
Servicer of its responsibility with respect to such duties and the Servicer
shall remain obligated and liable to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee for
its duties hereunder as if the Servicer alone were performing such duties. The
fees and expenses of any subservicer shall be as agreed between the Servicer and
such subservicer from time to time, and none of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, the Issuer or the Securityholders shall have any responsibility
thereof. For any servicing activities delegated to third parties in accordance
with this Section 7.05, the Servicer shall follow such policies and procedures
to monitor the performance of such third parties and compliance with such
servicing activities as the Servicer follows with respect to comparable motor
vehicle receivables serviced by the Servicer for its own account.

 



 24 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 7.06 Servicer Not to Resign.

 

(a)               Subject to the provisions of Section 7.03, the Servicer shall
not resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it by this Agreement as

this Agreement shall no longer be permissible under applicable law.

 

(b)               Notice of any determination that the performance by the
Servicer of its duties hereunder is no longer permitted under applicable law
shall be communicated to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee at the
earliest practicable time (and, if such communication is not in writing, shall
be confirmed in writing at the earliest practicable time) and any such
determination shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect
delivered by the Servicer to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
concurrently with or promptly after such notice. No resignation of the Servicer
shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the responsibilities
and obligations of the Servicer in accordance with Section 8.03. If no successor
Servicer has been appointed within 30 days of resignation or removal, the
Servicer, as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for such appointment.

ARTICLE VIII.

DEFAULT

 

Section 8.01 Servicer Termination Events. For purposes of this Agreement, the
occurrence and continuance of any of the following shall constitute a “Servicer
Termination Event”:

 

(a)               Any failure by the Servicer to deposit into any Account any
proceeds or payment required to be so delivered or to direct the Indenture
Trustee to make the required payment from any Account under the terms of this
Agreement that continues unremedied for a period of five Business days after
written notice is received by the Servicer or after discovery of such failure by
a Responsible Officer of the Servicer;

 

(b)               Failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or
perform, in any material respect, any covenants or agreements of the Servicer
set forth in this Agreement, which failure (i) materially and adversely affects
the rights of the Securityholders and (ii) continues unremedied for a period of
60 days after discovery of such failure by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer
or after the date on which written notice of such failure requiring the same to
be remedied shall have been given to the Servicer by any of the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee or Noteholders evidencing not less than 50% of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Class of Notes;

 



 25 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

(c)               If any representation or warranty of the Servicer, in its
capacity as Servicer, made in this Agreement shall prove to be incorrect in any
material respect as of the time when the same shall have been made and the
incorrectness of such representation or warranty has a material adverse effect
on the Issuer or the Noteholders and such failure continues unremedied for 90
days after discovery thereof by a Responsible Officer of the Servicer or receipt
by the Servicer of written notice thereof from the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders representing not less than 50% of the Outstanding Amounts of the
Notes; or

 

(d)               The occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the
Servicer;

 

provided, however, that a delay or failure of performance referred to under
clause (a) above for a period of 10 days or clause (b) or (c) above for a period
of 30 days will not constitute a Servicer Termination Event if such delay or
failure was caused by force majeure or other similar occurrence.

 

Section 8.02 Consequences of a Servicer Termination Event. If a Servicer
Termination Event shall occur, the Indenture Trustee or Noteholders evidencing
more than 50% of the voting interests of the Controlling Class may, by notice
given in writing to the Servicer (and to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee and the Depositor if given by such Noteholders), terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement. On or after the
receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority, power,
obligations and responsibilities of the Servicer under this Agreement
automatically shall pass to, be vested in and become obligations and
responsibilities of the successor Servicer; provided, however, that the
successor Servicer shall have no liability with respect to any obligation that
was required to be performed by the terminated Servicer prior to the date that
the successor Servicer becomes the Servicer or any claim of a third party based
on any alleged action or inaction of the terminated Servicer. The successor
Servicer is authorized and empowered by this Agreement to execute and deliver,
on behalf of the terminated Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and
all documents and other instruments and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivables
and related documents to show the Indenture Trustee (or the Owner Trustee if the
Notes have been paid in full) as lienholder or secured party on the related
certificates of title of the Financed Vehicles or otherwise. The terminated
Servicer agrees to cooperate with the successor Servicer in effecting the
termination of the responsibilities and rights of the terminated Servicer under
this Agreement, including the transfer to the successor Servicer for
administration by it of all money and property held by the Servicer with respect
to the Receivables and other records relating to the Receivables, including any
portion of the Receivables File held by the Servicer and a computer tape in
readable form as of the most recent Business Day containing all information
necessary to enable the successor Servicer to service the Receivables. The
terminated Servicer shall also provide the successor Servicer access to Servicer
personnel and computer records in order to facilitate the orderly and efficient
transfer of servicing duties.

 



 26 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

 

 

Section 8.03 Appointment of Successor Servicer.

 

(a)               On and after the time the Servicer receives a notice of
termination pursuant to Section 8.02 or upon the resignation of the Servicer
pursuant to Section 7.06, the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders evidencing
more than 50% of the voting interests of the Controlling Class shall appoint a
successor Servicer which shall be the successor in all respects to the Servicer
in its capacity as Servicer under this Agreement and shall be subject to all the
rights, responsibilities, restrictions, duties, liabilities and termination
provisions relating to the Servicer under this Agreement, except as otherwise
stated herein. The Depositor, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and such
successor Servicer shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as
shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession. In the event that the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders are unable to appoint a successor within
thirty (30) days of the date of the related notice of termination, the Indenture
Trustee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor
Servicer. If a successor Servicer is acting as Servicer hereunder, it shall be
subject to termination under Section 8.02 upon the occurrence of any Servicer
Termination Event after its appointment as successor Servicer. The original
Servicer shall pay any and all fees and expenses incurred as a result of a
transfer of servicing.

 

(b)               The Noteholders evidencing more than 50% of the voting
interests of the Controlling Class shall have no liability to the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer, the Depositor, any Noteholders, any
Certificateholders or any other Person if they exercise their right to appoint a
successor to the Servicer. Pending appointment pursuant to the preceding
paragraph, the outgoing Servicer shall continue to act as Servicer until a
successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment.

 

(c)               Upon appointment, the successor Servicer shall be the
successor in all respects to the predecessor Servicer and shall be subject to
all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities arising thereafter relating
thereto placed on the predecessor Servicer, and shall be entitled to the
Servicing Fee and all the rights granted to the predecessor Servicer by the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.04 Notification to Securityholders. Upon any termination of, or
appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Administrator shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Certificateholders
and each Rating Agency, and the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written
notice thereof to the Noteholders.

 

Section 8.05 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Noteholders evidencing more than 50%
of the voting interests of the Controlling Class may, on behalf of all
Securityholders, waive in writing any default by the Servicer in the performance
of its obligations hereunder and its consequences, except a default in making
any required deposits to or payments from any of the Trust Accounts in
accordance with this Agreement. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such
default shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Termination Event arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this
Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or
impair any right consequent thereto.

ARTICLE IX.


TERMINATION

 

Section 9.01 Optional Purchase of All Receivables.

 

(a)               On each Payment Date as of which the Pool Balance is equal to
or less than 5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Servicer shall have the option
to purchase the Receivables (the “Optional Purchase”). To exercise such Optional
Purchase, the Servicer shall deposit into the Collection Account pursuant to
Section 5.04 an amount equal to (i) the aggregate Purchased Amount for the
Receivables, less (ii) the amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account on such
date, and shall succeed to all interests in and to the Receivables. The exercise
of such option shall cause all outstanding Notes to be due and payable under the
Indenture and effect a redemption, in whole but not in part, of all outstanding
Notes. To avoid insufficient funds being available to make all payments as set
forth in Section 5.05(b) in full, any funds remaining on deposit in the Reserve
Account when the Optional Purchase is exercised shall be deposited into the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.06(e).

 

(b)               As described in Article 9 of the Trust Agreement, notice of
any termination of the Trust shall be given by the Servicer to the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee as soon as practicable after the Servicer has received
notice thereof.

 

(c)               Following the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture and
the payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Notes, the
Certificateholders will succeed to the rights of the Noteholders hereunder and
the Trust will succeed to the rights of, and assume the obligations to make
payments to Certificateholders of, the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X.

MISCELLANEOUS

(a)               This Agreement may be amended by the Depositor and the
Servicer, but without the consent of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee,
any of the Noteholders or the Certificateholders, to cure any ambiguity, to
correct or supplement any provisions in this Agreement, or for the purpose of
correcting any inconsistency with the Prospectus, or for the purpose of adding
any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
in this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders or
the Certificateholders subject to the satisfaction of one of the following
conditions:

 

(i) the Depositor or the Servicer delivers an Opinion of Counsel or an Officer’s
Certificate to the Indenture Trustee to the effect that such amendment will not
materially and adversely affect the interests of the Noteholders (and, if the

 28 (2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)

(b)               This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the
Depositor, the Servicer and the Issuer, with the prior written consent of the
Indenture Trustee and Noteholders holding not less than a majority of the

any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
of this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the

interest rate or principal amount of any Note or delay the Stated Maturity Date
of any Note without the consent of the Holder of such Note or (ii) reduce the
aforesaid percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, the Securityholders
of which are required to consent to any such amendment, without the consent of
the Noteholders holding all Outstanding Notes and Certificateholders holding all
outstanding Certificates.

 

Promptly after the execution of any amendment or consent, the Administrator
shall furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment or consent
to each Securityholder, the Indenture Trustee and each Rating Agency.

 

It shall not be necessary for the consent of Securityholders pursuant to this
Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but
it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

 

Prior to the execution of any amendment to this Agreement, the Owner Trustee, on
behalf of the Issuer, and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive and

the Servicer shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender or other
transferee computer tapes, records or printouts (including any restored from

Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act or any other similar state laws
based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
