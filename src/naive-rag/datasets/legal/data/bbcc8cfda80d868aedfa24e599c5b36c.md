this Section 2(d), and if on or after such Business Day the Investor purchases
(in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by the Investor of such Purchase Shares that the

a share of Common Stock up or down to the nearest whole share. All payments made
under this Agreement shall be made in lawful money of the United States of
America or wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the
Company may from time to time designate by written notice in accordance with the

issuance in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE
American, any other Principal Market on which the Common Stock may be listed or
quoted, and the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the
“Certificate of Incorporation”), and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws,
as amended (the “Bylaws”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may, but
shall be under no obligation to, request its stockholders to approve the
issuance of Common Stock as contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that if
stockholder approval is not obtained in accordance with this Section 2(e)(i),
the Exchange Cap shall be applicable for all purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby at all times during the term of this Agreement
(except as set forth in
Section 2(e)(ii) below).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii)    At-Market Transaction. Notwithstanding Section 2(e)(i) above and subject
to the prior approval of the NYSE American or any other Principal Market on
which the Common Stock may be listed or quoted (to the extent required), the
Exchange Cap shall not be applicable for any purposes of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, solely to the extent that the issuances and
sales of Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement are deemed to be at a price
equal to or in excess of the greater of book or market value of the Common Stock
as calculated in accordance with the applicable rules of the NYSE American or
any other Principal Market on which the Common Stock may be listed or quoted (it
being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Exchange Cap shall be applicable
for all purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at
all other times during the term of this Agreement, unless the stockholder
approval referred to in Section 2(e)(i) is obtained).

(iii)    General. The Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement if such issuance would reasonably be expected to
result in (A) a violation of the Securities Act or (B) a breach of the rules and
regulations of the NYSE American or any other Principal Market on which the
Common Stock may be listed or quoted. The provisions of this Section 2(f) shall
be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms
hereof only if necessary to ensure compliance with the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations of NYSE American or any other the Principal Market on
which the Common Stock may be listed or quoted.

(f)    Beneficial Ownership Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not issue or sell, and the
Investor shall not purchase or acquire, any shares of Common Stock under this
Agreement which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then
beneficially owned by the Investor and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder) would
result in the beneficial ownership by the Investor and its affiliates of more
than 9.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the
“Beneficial Ownership Limitation”). Upon the written or oral request of the
Investor, the Company shall promptly (but not later than one (1) Business Day)
confirm orally or in writing to the Investor the amount of Common Stock then
outstanding. The Investor and the Company shall each cooperate in good faith in
the determinations required hereby and the application hereof. The Investor’s
written certification to the Company of the applicability of the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, and the resulting effect thereof hereunder at any time,
shall be conclusive with respect to the applicability thereof and such result
absent manifest error.

(g)    Excess Share Limitation. If the Company delivers any Purchase Notice for
a Purchase Amount in excess of the limitations contained in this Section 2, such
Purchase Notice shall be void ab initio to the extent of the amount by which the
number of Purchase Shares set forth in such Purchase Notice exceeds the number
of Purchase Shares which the Company is permitted to include in such Purchase
Notice in accordance herewith, and the Investor shall have no obligation to
purchase such excess Purchase Shares in respect of such Purchase Notice;
provided, however, that the Investor shall remain obligated to purchase the
number of Purchase Shares which the Company is permitted to include in such
Purchase Notice.

(h)    Adjustments for Shares. All share-related numbers contained in this
Section 2, and the Regular Purchase Share Limit, shall be adjusted to take into
account any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split or
other similar transaction effected with respect to the Common Stock except as
specifically stated herein.

Company.

(f)    SEC Documents; Financial Statements. The Company has filed all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by the
Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including pursuant to

such material) (the foregoing materials, including the exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, being collectively referred to
herein as the “SEC Documents”) on a timely basis or has received a valid
extension of such time of filing and has filed any such SEC Documents prior to
the expiration of any such extension. As of their respective dates and to the
Company’s knowledge, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
applicable.    None of the SEC Documents, when filed, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents comply in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of

United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (“GAAP”), except as may be otherwise specified
in such financial statements or the notes thereto and except that unaudited
financial statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit
adjustments. Except as publicly available through the SEC’s Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) or in connection with a

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(g)    Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the Registration
Statement or the SEC Documents, since December 31, 2018, there has been no
material adverse change in the business, properties, operations, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The
Company has not taken any steps, and does not currently expect to take any
steps, to seek protection pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law nor does the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries have any knowledge or reason to believe that its
creditors intend to initiate involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.
The Company is financially solvent and is generally able to pay its debts as
they become due.

(h)    Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement

or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, the
Common Stock or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries or any of the Company’s or the
Company’s Subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, which
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(i)    Acknowledgment Regarding Investor’s Status. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that the Investor is acting solely in the capacity of arm’s length
purchaser with respect to the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company further acknowledges that the
Investor is not acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in
any similar capacity) with respect to the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and any advice given by the
Investor or any of its representatives or agents in connection with the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
merely incidental to the Investor’s purchase of the Securities. The Company
further represents to the Investor that the Company’s decision to enter into the
Transaction Documents has been based solely on the independent evaluation by the
Company and its representatives and advisors.

(j)    No Integrated Offering. Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates,
nor any Person acting on its or their behalf has, directly or indirectly, made
any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security,
under circumstances that would cause this offering of the Securities to be
integrated with prior offerings by the Company in a manner that would require
stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the Principal Market on which any
of the securities of the Company are listed or designated. The issuance and sale
of the Securities hereunder does not contravene the rules and regulations of the
Principal Market.

(k)    Intellectual Property Rights. Except as disclosed in the Registration
Statement or the SEC Documents, the Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess
adequate rights or licenses to use all material trademarks, trade names, service
marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent rights,

marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent rights,
copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, government authorizations, trade
secrets or other intellectual property rights have expired or terminated, or, by
the terms and conditions thereof, could expire or terminate within two years
from the date of this Agreement, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.    The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have
any knowledge of any infringement by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any
material trademark, trade name rights, patents, patent rights, copyrights,
inventions, licenses, service names, service marks, service mark registrations,
trade secret or other similar rights of others, and there is no claim, action or
proceeding being made or brought against, or to the Company’s knowledge, being
threatened against, the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding trademark, trade
name, patents, patent rights, invention, copyright, license, service names,
service marks, service mark registrations, trade secret or other infringement,
which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(“Environmental Laws”), (ii) have received all permits, licenses or other
approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their
respective businesses and (iii) are in compliance with all terms and conditions
of any such permit, license or approval, except where, in each of the three

all personal property owned by them that is material to the business of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances and defects (“Liens”) and, except for Liens as do not materially
affect the value of such property and do not materially interfere with the use
made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company and the
Subsidiaries and Liens for the payment of federal, state or other taxes, the
payment of which is neither delinquent nor subject to penalties. Any real
property and facilities held under lease by the Company and the Subsidiaries are
held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases with which the

material and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such
property and buildings by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks
and in such amounts as management of the Company believes to be prudent and
customary in the businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are
engaged. Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has been refused any
insurance coverage sought or applied for and neither the Company nor any such
Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its
existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain
similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its
business at a cost that would not materially and adversely affect the financial
condition or the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(o)    Regulatory Permits. Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement or
the SEC Documents, the Company and its Subsidiaries possess all certificates,
authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate federal, state or foreign
regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses as

authorizations, or permits would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has received any
notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such
certificate, authorization or permit.

(p)    Tax Status. Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement or the SEC
Documents, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or filed all
federal and state income and all other material tax returns, reports and

on its books provisions reasonably adequate for the payment of all unpaid and
unreported taxes) and has paid all taxes and other governmental assessments and
charges that are material in amount, shown or determined to be due on such
returns, reports and declarations, except those being contested in good faith
and has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for the payment of
all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such returns, reports
or declarations apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any amount claimed to be due
by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, except as would not reasonably be

of no basis for any such claim.

action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition,
business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights
agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Certificate of
Incorporation or the laws of the state of its incorporation which is or could
become applicable to the Investor as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s issuance of the
Securities and the Investor’s ownership of the Securities.

(s)    Disclosure. Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents that will be timely
publicly disclosed by the Company, the Company confirms that neither it nor any
other Person acting on its behalf has provided the Investor or its agents or
counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute
material, non-public information which is not otherwise disclosed in the
Registration Statement or any Prospectus Supplements thereto.    The Company
understands and confirms that the Investor will rely on the foregoing
representation in effecting purchases and sales of securities of the
Company. All of the disclosure furnished by or on behalf of the Company to the
Investor regarding the Company, its business and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the disclosure schedules to this Agreement, is true and
correct in all material respects and does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The press releases disseminated by the Company during the
12 months preceding the date of this Agreement taken as a whole do not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made and when made,
not misleading. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Investor neither
makes nor has made any representations or warranties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby other than those specifically set forth in
Section 3 hereof.

political activity, (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic
government officials or employees or to any foreign or domestic political

issued or intends to issue a stop order or other similar order with respect to
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or that the SEC otherwise has
(i) suspended or withdrawn the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
(ii) issued any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus or any
Prospectus Supplement, in either case, either temporarily or permanently or
intends or has threatened in writing to do so. The “Plan of Distribution”
section of the Prospectus permits the issuance of the Securities hereunder. At
the time the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto became effective,
at the date of this Agreement and at each deemed effective date thereof pursuant
to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the Securities Act, the Registration Statement and any
amendments thereto complied and will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and did not and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and
the Base Prospectus and any Prospectus Supplement thereto, at the time such Base
Prospectus or such Prospectus Supplement thereto was issued and on the
Commencement Date, complied and will comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and did not and will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that this representation and warranty does
not apply to statements in or omissions from any Prospectus Supplement made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to the Investor
furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of the Investor expressly
for use therein. The Company meets all of the requirements for the use of a
registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to the Securities Act for the
offering and sale of the Securities contemplated by this Agreement without
reliance on General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3, and the SEC has not notified
the Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Registration
Statement pursuant to Rule 401(g)(1) of the Securities Act. The Registration
Statement, as of its effective date, meets the requirements set forth in Rule
415(a)(1)(x) pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company has not been since
December 31, 2018, and currently is not, an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in
Rule 405 of the Securities Act). The Company has not distributed any offering
material in connection with the offering and sale of any of the Securities, and,
until the Investor does not hold any of the Securities, shall not distribute any
offering material in connection with the offering and sale of any of the
Securities, to or by the Investor, in each case, other than the Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement
required pursuant to applicable law or the Transaction Documents. The Company
has not made, and agrees that unless it obtains the prior written consent of the
Investor it will not make, an offer relating to the Securities that would
constitute a “free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rules 164 and
433 under the Securities Act applicable to any such free writing prospectus
consented to by the Investor, including in respect of timely filing with the
SEC, legending and record keeping. The offering of the Securities pursuant to
this Agreement qualifies for the exemption from the filing requirements of Rule
5110 of the FINRA afforded by FINRA Rule 5110(b)(7)(C)(i).

(v)    DTC Eligibility. The Company, through the Transfer Agent, currently
participates in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program and

Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program.

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, which are applicable to it as of
the date hereof.

(x)    Certain Fees. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4(x), no brokerage or
finder’s fees or commissions are or will be payable by the Company to any
broker, financial advisor or consultant, finder, placement agent, investment
banker, bank or other Person with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4(x), the Investor
shall have no obligation with respect to any fees or with respect to any claims
made by or on behalf of other Persons for fees of a type contemplated in this
Section 4(x) that may be due in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents.

pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company has taken no

nor has the Company received any notification that the SEC is currently

thereof from the Company. The Investor shall furnish to the Company such
information regarding itself, the Securities held by it and the intended method
of distribution thereof, including any arrangement between the Investor and any

otherwise cooperate with the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the preparation and filing of the Current Report and the Initial
Prospectus Supplement with the SEC.

reasonably necessary in order to obtain an exemption for or to register or
qualify (i) the issuance of the Commitment Shares and the sale of the Purchase

all Commitment Shares and all Purchase Shares by the Investor, in each case,
under applicable securities or “Blue Sky” laws of the states of the United
States in such states as is reasonably requested by the Investor from time to
time, and shall provide evidence of any such action so taken to the Investor.

(c)    Listing/DTC. The Company shall promptly secure the listing of all of the
Purchase Shares and Commitment Shares to be issued to the Investor hereunder on
the Principal Market (subject to official notice of issuance) and upon each
other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, if any, upon
which the Common Stock is then listed, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain, so long as any shares of Common Stock shall be so listed,
such listing of all such Securities from time to time issuable hereunder. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the
Common Stock on the Principal Market and shall comply in all respects with the
Company’s reporting, filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules and
regulations of the Principal Market. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to result
in the delisting or suspension of the Common Stock on the Principal Market. The
Company shall promptly, and in no event later than the following Business Day,
provide to the Investor copies of any notices it receives from the Principal
Market regarding the continued eligibility of the Common Stock for listing on
the Principal Market; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
to provide the Investor copies of any such notice that the Company reasonably
believes constitutes material non-public information and the Company would not
be required to publicly disclose such notice in any report or statement filed
with the SEC under the Exchange Act (including on Form 8-K) or the Securities
Act. The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying
its obligations under this Section 5(c). The Company shall take all action
necessary to ensure that its Common Stock can be transferred electronically as

agents, representatives and affiliates shall not in any manner whatsoever enter
into or effect, directly or indirectly, any (i) “short sale” (as such term is
defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO of the Exchange Act) of the Common Stock
or (ii) hedging transaction, which establishes a net short position with respect
to the Common Stock.

(e)    Issuance of Commitment Shares. In consideration for the Investor’s
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall cause to be issued
to the Investor a total of 343,171 shares of Common Stock (the “Initial
Commitment Shares”) immediately upon the execution of this Agreement and shall
deliver to the Transfer Agent the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions with
respect to the issuance of such Initial Commitment Shares. The Company shall
cause to be issued to the Investor up to 171,585 shares of Common Stock (the
“Additional Commitment Shares” and, collectively with the Initial Commitment
Shares, the “Commitment Shares”), as follows: in connection with each purchase
of Purchase Shares hereunder, the Company shall issue to the Investor a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) 171,585 and (y) the
Purchase Amount Fraction. The “Purchase Amount Fraction” shall

 

20



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mean a fraction, the numerator of which is the Purchase Amount purchased by the
Investor with respect to such purchase of Purchase Shares and the denominator of
which is Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000). The Additional Commitment
Shares shall be equitably adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization,
non-cash dividend, stock split or other similar transaction. For the avoidance
of doubt, (1) all of the Initial Commitment Shares shall be fully earned as of
the date of this Agreement, whether or not the Commencement shall occur or any
Purchase Shares (other than the Initial Purchase Shares) are purchased by the
Investor under this Agreement and irrespective of any subsequent termination of
this Agreement and (2) the Additional Commitment Shares shall be fully earned as
of the date of their issuance to the Investor pursuant to this Agreement,
irrespective of any subsequent termination of this Agreement.

(f)    Due Diligence; Non-Public Information. The Investor shall have the right,
from time to time as the Investor may reasonably deem appropriate and upon
reasonable advance notice to the Company, to perform reasonable due diligence on
the Company during normal business hours. The Company and its officers and
employees shall provide information and reasonably cooperate with the Investor
in connection with any reasonable request by the Investor related to the
Investor’s due diligence of the Company. Each party hereto agrees not to
disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to any third party and
shall not use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than in
connection with, or in furtherance of, the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each party hereto acknowledges that the Confidential Information shall remain
the property of the disclosing party and agrees that it shall take all
reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of any Confidential Information
disclosed by the other party. The receiving party may disclose Confidential
Information to the extent such information is required to be disclosed by law,
regulation or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or regulatory
authority, provided that the receiving party shall promptly notify the
disclosing party when such requirement to disclose arises, and shall cooperate
with the disclosing party so as to enable the disclosing party to: (i) seek an
appropriate protective order; and (ii) make any applicable claim of
confidentiality in respect of such Confidential Information; and provided,
further, that the receiving party shall disclose Confidential Information only
to the extent required by the protective order or other similar order, if such
an order is obtained, and, if no such order is obtained, the receiving party
shall disclose only the minimum amount of such Confidential Information required
to be disclosed in order to comply with the applicable law, regulation or order.
In addition, any such Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this
section shall continue to be deemed Confidential Information. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and the Investor agree
that neither the Company nor any other Person acting on its behalf shall provide
the Investor or its agents or counsel with any information that constitutes or
may reasonably be considered to constitute material, non-public information,
unless a simultaneous public announcement thereof is made by the Company in the
manner contemplated by Regulation FD. In the event of a breach of the foregoing
covenant by the Company or any Person acting on its behalf (as determined in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Investor), in addition to any other remedy
provided herein or in the other Transaction Documents, the Investor shall have
the right to make a public disclosure, in the form of a press release, public
advertisement or otherwise, of such material, non-public information without the
prior approval by the Company; provided the Investor shall have first provided
notice to the Company that it believes it has received information that
constitutes material, non-public information, the Company shall have at least 24
hours to publicly disclose such material, non-public information prior to any
such disclosure by the Investor, and the Company shall have failed to publicly
disclose such material, non-public information within such time period. The
Investor shall not have any liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders or
agents, for any such disclosure. The Company understands and confirms that the
Investor shall be relying on the foregoing covenants in effecting transactions
in securities of the Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(g)     Purchase Records. The Investor and the Company shall each maintain
records showing the remaining Available Amount at any given time and the dates
and Purchase Amounts for each Regular Purchase, Accelerated Purchase and
Additional Accelerated Purchase or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Investor and the Company.

(h)    Taxes. The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp or similar taxes
that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of any shares of

(i)    Effective Registration Statement; Current Prospectus; Securities Law

the Registration Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the
Securities Act, and to keep the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
current and available for issuances and sales of all of the Securities by the
Company to the Investor, and for the resale by the Investor, at all times until
the earlier of (i) the date on which the Investor shall have sold all the
Securities and no Available Amount remains under this Agreement and (ii) 180
days following the earlier of termination of this Agreement and the Maturity
Date (the “Registration Period”). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during the Registration Period, the Company shall (a) take all action
necessary to cause the Common Stock to continue to be registered as a class of
securities under Sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, shall comply with
its reporting and filing obligations under the Exchange Act, and shall not take
any action or file any document (whether or not permitted by the Exchange Act)
to terminate or suspend such registration or to terminate or suspend its
reporting and filing obligations under the Exchange Act, and (b) prepare and
file with the SEC, at the Company’s expense, such amendments (including, without
limitation, post-effective amendments) to the Registration Statement and such
Prospectus Supplements pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, in each
case, as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective pursuant
to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, and to keep the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus current and available for issuances and sales of
all of the Securities by the Company to the Investor, and for the resale of all
of the Securities by the Investor, at all times during the Registration Period
(it being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC, at the Company’s expense, immediately prior to the third
anniversary of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement (the
“Renewal Date”), a new Registration Statement relating to the Securities, in a
form satisfactory to the Investor and its counsel, and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be
declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Date unless the
Registration Period has lapsed). The Investor shall furnish to the Company such
information regarding itself, the Securities held by it and the intended method
of distribution thereof as shall be reasonably requested by the Company in
connection with the preparation and filing of any such amendment to the
Registration Statement (or new Registration Statement) or any such Prospectus
Supplement, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Company as reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of any
such amendment to the Registration Statement (or new Registration Statement) or
any such Prospectus Supplement. The Company shall comply with all applicable
federal, state and foreign securities laws in connection with the offer,
issuance and sale of the Securities contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of
its officers, directors or affiliates acting on the Company’s behalf will take,
directly or indirectly, any action designed or intended to stabilize or
manipulate the price of any security of the Company, or which would reasonably
be expected to cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of
any security of the Company.

(j)    Stop Orders. The Company shall advise the Investor promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours) and shall confirm such advice in writing: (i) of the
Company’s receipt of notice of any request by the SEC for amendment of or a
supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Prospectus
Supplement or for any additional information with respect thereto; (ii) of the
Company’s receipt of notice of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or prohibiting or
suspending the use of the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, or of the
Company’s receipt of any notification of the suspension of qualification of the
Securities for offering or sale in any

 

22



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jurisdiction or the initiation or contemplated initiation of any proceeding for
such purpose; and (iii) of the Company becoming aware of the happening of any
event which makes any statement of a material fact made in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement untrue or which requires
the making of any additions to or changes to the statements then made in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement in order to
state a material fact required by the Securities Act to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements then made therein (in the case of the
Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, or of the necessity to amend the
Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement
to comply with the Securities Act or any other law. The Company shall not be
required to disclose to the Investor the substance or specific reasons of any of
the events set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, but rather, shall only be required to disclose that the event has
occurred. The Company shall not deliver to the Investor any Regular Purchase
Notice, Accelerated Purchase Notice or Additional Accelerated Purchase Notice,
and the Investor shall not be obligated to purchase any shares of Common Stock
under this Agreement, during the continuation or pendency of any of the
foregoing events. If at any time the SEC shall issue any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or prohibiting or suspending the
use of the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the
earliest possible time. The Company shall furnish to the Investor, without
charge, a copy of any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the
Company or its representatives relating to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as the case may be.

(k)    Amendments to Registration Statement; Prospectus Supplements. Except as
provided in this Agreement and other than periodic and current reports required
to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company shall not file with the
SEC any amendment to the Registration Statement or any supplement to the Base
Prospectus that refers to the Investor, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, any Prospectus
Supplement filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents), in each case with respect to which (a) the Investor
shall not previously have been advised and afforded the opportunity to review
and comment thereon at least two (2) Business Days prior to filing with the SEC,
as the case may be, (b) the Company shall not have given due consideration to
any comments thereon received from the Investor or its counsel, or (c) the
Investor shall reasonably object, unless the Company reasonably has determined
that it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or make any supplement
to the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or any other applicable law
or regulation, in which case the Company shall promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) so inform the Investor, the Investor shall be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any disclosure referring to
the Investor, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby, as applicable, and the Company shall expeditiously furnish to the
Investor a copy thereof. In addition, for so long as, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Investor, the Prospectus is required to be delivered in
connection with any acquisition or sale of Securities by the Investor, the
Company shall not file any Prospectus Supplement with respect to the Securities
without furnishing to the Investor as many copies of such Prospectus Supplement,
together with the Prospectus, as the Investor may reasonably request.

(l)    Prospectus Delivery. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus
(and of each Prospectus Supplement thereto) in accordance with the provisions of
the Securities Act and with the securities or “blue sky” laws of the
jurisdictions in which the Securities may be sold by the Investor, in connection
with the offering and sale of the Securities and for such period of time
thereafter as the Prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered
in connection with sales of the Securities. The Company will make available to
the Investor upon request, and thereafter from time to time will furnish to the
Investor, as many copies of the Prospectus (and each Prospectus Supplement
thereto) as the Investor may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by
the Securities Act within the time during which the Prospectus is required by
the Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities.

 

23



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If during such period of time any event shall occur that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company and its counsel, or in the reasonable judgment of the
Investor and its counsel, is required to be set forth in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement or should be set forth
therein in order to make the statements made therein (in the case of the
Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, or if in the reasonable judgment of the
Company and its counsel, or in the reasonable judgment of the Investor and its
counsel, it is otherwise necessary to amend the Registration Statement or
supplement the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement to comply with the
Securities Act or any other applicable law or regulation, the Company shall
forthwith prepare and, subject to Section 5(k) above, file with the SEC an
appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement or an appropriate Prospectus
Supplement and in each case shall expeditiously furnish to the Investor, at the
Company’s expense, such amendment to the Registration Statement or such
Prospectus Supplement, as applicable, as may be necessary to reflect any such
change or to effect such compliance. The Company shall have no obligation to
separately advise the Investor of, or deliver copies to the Investor of, the SEC
Documents, all of which the Investor shall be deemed to have notice and
knowledge of.

(m)    Integration. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will
not, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no Person
acting on its behalf will, directly or indirectly, make any offers or sales of
any security or solicit any offers to buy any security, under circumstances that
would cause this offering of the Securities to be integrated with other
offerings by the Company in a manner that would require stockholder approval
pursuant to the rules of the Principal Market on which any of the securities of
the Company are listed or designated, unless stockholder approval is obtained
before the closing of such subsequent transaction in accordance with the rules
of such Principal Market.

(n)    Use of Proceeds. The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering
as described in the Prospectus.

(o)    Other Transactions. The Company shall not enter into, announce or
recommend to its stockholders any agreement, plan, arrangement or transaction in
or of which the terms thereof would restrict, materially delay, conflict with or
impair the ability or right of the Company to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the obligation of the
Company to deliver the Purchase Shares and the Commitment Shares to the Investor
in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Documents.

(p)    Required Filings Relating to Purchases. To the extent required under the
Securities Act or under interpretations by the SEC thereof, as promptly as
practicable after the close of each of the Company’s fiscal quarters (or on such
other dates as required under the Securities Act or under interpretations by the
SEC thereof), the Company shall prepare a Prospectus Supplement, which will set
forth the number of Purchase Shares sold to the Investor during such quarterly
period (or other relevant period), the purchase price for such Purchase Shares
and the net proceeds received by the Company from such sales, and shall file
such Prospectus Supplement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act (and within the time periods required by Rule 424(b) and Rule
430B under the Securities Act). If any such quarterly Prospectus Supplement is
not required to be filed under the Securities Act or under interpretations by
the SEC thereof, the Company shall disclose the information referenced in the
immediately preceding sentence in its annual report on Form 10-K or its
quarterly report on Form 10-Q (as applicable) in respect of the quarterly period
that ended immediately before the filing of such report in which sales of
Purchase Shares were made to the Investor under this Agreement, and file such
report with the SEC within the applicable time period required by the Exchange
Act. The Company shall not file any Prospectus Supplement pursuant to this
Section 5(p), and shall not file any report containing disclosure relating to
such sales of Purchase Shares, unless a copy of such Prospectus Supplement or
disclosure has been submitted to the Investor a reasonable period of time before
the filing and the Investor has not reasonably objected thereto (it being
acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall not submit any portion of any
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q

 

24



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

other than the specific disclosure relating to any sales of Purchase Shares).
The Company shall also furnish copies of all such Prospectus Supplements to each
exchange or market in the United States on which sales of the Purchase Shares
may be made as may be required by the rules or regulations of such exchange or
market, if applicable.

(q)    No Variable Rate Transactions. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of (i) the 36-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement,
(ii) 6 months following the date on which the Company shall have received the
full Available Amount pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) in the event of early
termination of this Agreement, the date on which the Investor shall have sold
all of the Securities acquired by the Investor hereunder, the Company shall be
prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to effect any issuance
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents (or a combination of units thereof) involving a Variable Rate
Transaction, other than in connection with an Exempt Issuance. The Investor
shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the Company and its
Subsidiaries to preclude any such issuance, which remedy shall be in addition to
any right to collect damages, without the necessity of showing economic loss and
without any bond or other security being required. “Common Stock Equivalents”
means any securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries which entitle the holder
thereof to acquire at any time Common Stock, including, without limitation, any
debt, preferred stock, rights, options, warrants or other instrument that is at
any time convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or otherwise
entitles the holder thereof to receive, Common Stock. “Variable Rate
Transaction” means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or sells any
debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable
for, or include the right to receive additional shares of Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price, exchange
rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of
or quotations for the Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance of
such debt or equity securities (including, without limitation, pursuant to any
“cashless exercise” provision), or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange
price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial
issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or
contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company
or the market for the Common Stock (including, without limitation, any “full
ratchet” or “weighted average” anti-dilution provisions), (ii) issues or sells
any debt or equity securities, including without limitation, Common Stock or
Common Stock Equivalents, either (A) at a price that is subject to being reset
at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security
or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly
related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common Stock, or
(B) that is subject to or contains any put, call, redemption, buy-back,
price-reset or other similar provision or mechanism (including, without
limitation, a “Black-Scholes” put or call right) that provides for the issuance
of additional debt or equity securities of the Company or the payment of cash by
the Company, or (iii) enters into any agreement, including, but not limited to,
an “equity line of credit”, “at-the-market offering” or other continuous
offering or similar offering of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents,

defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Investor and all of its
affiliates, stockholders, officers, directors, members, managers, employees and
direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing Person’s agents or other
representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the
“Indemnitees”) from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits,
claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in
connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to
the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements (the “Indemnified Liabilities”),
incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of or relating to:
(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or
document contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) any breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or
any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby,
(c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee
and arising out of or resulting from the execution, delivery, performance or
enforcement of the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or
document contemplated hereby or thereby, (d) any violation of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or “Blue Sky” laws, or the rules and
regulations of the Principal Market in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors or employees, (e) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained, or
incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement or any amendment
thereto or any omission or alleged omission to state therein, or in any document
incorporated by reference therein, a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (f) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained, or
incorporated by reference, in the Prospectus, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein, or in any document incorporated by reference therein,
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that (I) the indemnity contained in clause
(c) of this Section 9 shall not apply to any Indemnified Liabilities which
directly and primarily result from the fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of an Indemnitee, (II) the indemnity contained in clauses (d), (e)
and (f) of this Section 9 shall not apply to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use in any Prospectus
Supplement (it being hereby acknowledged and agreed that the written information
set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto is the only written information furnished
to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use in the Initial
Prospectus Supplement), if the Prospectus was timely made available by the
Company to the Investor pursuant to Section 5(l), (III) the indemnity contained
in clauses (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 9 shall not inure to the benefit of
the Investor to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are based on a failure
of the Investor to deliver or to cause to be delivered the Prospectus made
available by the Company, if such Prospectus was timely made available by the
Company pursuant to Section 5(l), and if delivery of the Prospectus would have
cured the defect giving rise to such Indemnified Liabilities, and (IV) the
indemnity in this Section 9 shall not apply to amounts paid

 

29



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in settlement of any claim if such settlement is effected without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent that the foregoing undertaking
by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified
Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. Payment under this
indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date the
Indemnitee makes written request for it. A certificate containing reasonable
detail as to the amount of such indemnification submitted to the Company by the
Indemnitee shall be conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, of the amount
due from the Company to the Indemnitee, provided that the Indemnitee shall
undertake to repay any amounts paid to it hereunder if it is ultimately
determined, by a final and non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such
Indemnified Liabilities by the Company pursuant to this Agreement. If any action
shall be brought against any Indemnitee in respect of which indemnity may be
sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee. Any Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnitee, except to
the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by
the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of
time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there
is, in the reasonable opinion of such separate counsel, a material conflict on
any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such
Indemnitee, in which case the Company shall be responsible for the reasonable
fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel.

consolidation. The Investor may not assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement.

(h)    No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is intended for the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
and, except as set forth in Section 9, is not for the benefit of, nor may any
provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person.

(i)    Publicity. The Company shall afford the Investor and its counsel with the
opportunity to review and comment upon, shall consult with the Investor and its
counsel on the form and substance of, and shall give due consideration to all
such comments from the Investor or its counsel on, any press release, SEC filing
or any other public disclosure by or on behalf of the Company relating to the

Section 12(i) shall not apply if the form and substance of such press release,
SEC filing, or other public disclosure relating to the Investor, its purchases
hereunder or any aspect of the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby previously have been publicly disclosed by the Company in
compliance with this Section 12(i). The Company agrees and acknowledges that its
failure to fully comply with this provision constitutes a Material Adverse
Effect.

and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver
all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other
party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(m)    Remedies, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief. The
Investor’s remedies provided in this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Investor’s remedies provided in Section 9, shall be cumulative and in
addition to all other remedies available to the Investor under this Agreement,
at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other
injunctive relief), no remedy of the Investor contained herein shall be deemed a
waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy and nothing
herein shall limit the Investor’s right to pursue actual damages for any failure
by the Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The Company
acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause
irreparable harm to the Investor and that the remedy at law for any such breach
may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such
breach or threatened breach, the Investor shall be entitled, in addition to all
other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the
necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being
required.

(n)    Enforcement Costs. In the event of a dispute arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final,
non-appealable order that a party has breached this Agreement, then, in addition
to any other available remedies, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to,
and the breaching party shall be liable for, the reasonable legal fees and
expenses incurred by the non-breaching party in connection with the dispute,
including any appeals in connection therewith. If this Agreement is placed by
the Investor in the hands of an attorney for enforcement or is enforced by the
Investor through any legal proceeding or an attorney is retained to represent
the Investor in any bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other
proceedings affecting creditors’ rights and involving a claim under this
Agreement, then the Company shall pay to the Investor, as incurred by the
Investor, all reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection therewith, in addition to all other amounts due
hereunder. If this Agreement is placed by the Company in the hands of an
attorney for enforcement or is enforced by the Company through any legal
proceeding, then the Investor shall pay to the Company, as incurred by the
Company, all reasonable costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection therewith, in addition to all other amounts due
hereunder.

(o)    Amendment and Waiver; Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No provision of
this Agreement may be waived other than in a written instrument signed by the
party against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought. No failure or delay in
the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or privilege.
