## _Preface_

 **The Hubert Portrait: Lisa and Her Daughters, Anna, Merrill and Ellie**

Oil on canvas 40″ × 56″ (102cm × 142cm) from the Huber Collection

Those of us who are interested in producing a portrait of another human being are usually so enchanted by this prospect that every other kind of artistic endeavor pales by comparison.

It's an interesting phenomenon that every person on our planet has two eyes, one nose and one mouth, and yet each of us looks completely different from everyone else. This is the uniqueness that the portrait painter must catch. This "differentness" plus the specific personality projected make up what we call "the likeness," and the painter's skill and sensitivity in being able to capture these elements are what make the portrait successful.

I'm hoping that you have had some previous experience in drawing and painting before tackling this book. To learn the use of charcoal, oil and watercolors by painting people is a most difficult task, and as a beginner, you may lay down your tools in frustration. However, once you've had some success with faces you may never again find the same sort of excitement depicting landscapes and still life.

If you can achieve a recognizable image in charcoal and understand something about mixing and applying colors, you will gain a great deal from this book. Just remember, no one is born knowing how to paint a portrait. Each of us has to learn — by studying, thinking and working. If you have the desire, you will surely learn, too.

##  _The Proportions_ of the Head

 **Meditation**

Watercolor on 140-lb. (300gsm) cold press 14″ × 16″ (36cm × 41cm)

**T** he success of a portrait is largely determined by how well the parts of the head interrelate: how the nose relates to the ears, the mouth to the jaw, the eyes to the nose, the face to the head — all these things must be discovered. This isn't overwhelming if you have a plan or blueprint of the way these parts fit together.

###  _Considering Solid Forms_

Before you can draw and paint portraits, you must learn to simplify very complex subject matter — the human head and body. Every portrait painter trains herself to perceive these forms in simple masses, overlooking details until the larger forms are satisfactory.

To draw or paint a head that will appear to look solid, round and three-dimensional, begin to think about light and shadow and how to add these elements to the linear egg-shaped head.

First decide where the light source is that shines on the egg-shaped head. Study the drawings in the following experiment. The part of the form that faces the light source is the _light area_ (A). Another part will receive no light, the _shadow area_ (B). Notice that this very distinct jump from light to shadow really doesn't help to indicate round form.

An intermediate step between the light and the shadow is necessary. This transition step is called the _halftone_. It is a very narrow area (C), which indicates a rounding of the form from the light area into the shadow area.

Now you're thinking in terms of light, shadow and halftone, but there is one more element to consider — _reflected light_. If this ovoid head form were on a body wearing a colored garment, you would see the color reflected up into the shadow area on the jaw or under the chin (D). This bounced light is subtle and never as light as the halftone. Remember that reflected light is part of the shadow, and if it is made too light the head will no longer appear solid.

**Egg-Shaped Head**

It's possible to draw a head shape using line alone. A circle is a basic beginning, but an egg shape resembles the human head more closely:

####  _Experiment_

With a pencil or pen and paper, try drawing the light (A), shadow (B), halftone (C) and reflected light (D) yourself. After about twenty oval "heads" you will find you can draw these solid forms with ease and understanding.

Use shadow to define form. Artists call this "modeling the form." Look for the lights first, but the only way the lights can be defined on white paper is to draw in the shadow first. This makes the "seeing process" different from the "doing process."

###  _Exercise_

Making an Egg Head

As a prelude to working with an actual head, let's learn about the relationships between light and dark by using an actual egg. Experimenting with an egg head has an advantage at the beginning of your study of the head and features: You can set it at any angle you choose — yet it won't move. To make an egg head, take an egg and make a hole in each end with a pin. Hold the egg over a bowl and blow into one end — the insides will come out, leaving the empty shell. Rinse it out with clean water, handling it carefully. (When you begin to use your egg as a model to draw form, you can make it stand on end by using an empty pill bottle or a bottle cap as a base.)

**1** Hold the egg upright and draw a line with a fine marker or a pencil straight down the shell's center, top to bottom. Now draw a second line horizontally around the egg, halfway down and at right angles to the first line. On either side of the vertical line, draw eye ovals on the horizontal line — this is called the _eye line_.

**2** Add a second horizontal line just above the eye ovals. This will be the eyebrow line. Now, not quite halfway down between the eyebrow line and the very bottom of the egg, make a mark for a nose, crossing the central vertical.

**3** Now try turning the egg a quarter turn to the right. You may need to add another vertical line from top to bottom halfway around the side where the ear would be. The egg now resembles a football.

**4** Tilt the egg slightly forward and you will see that the eye line appears to round downward at the center front and curve up at the sides. This curve is what makes the head "look down."

###  _Lighting the Egg_

Hold the eggshell so the brightest light from a window or a spotlight strikes it at the upper left front, and study the shadows on the shell. Do you notice the way these shadows change with even the slightest tilting of the shell? Place the egg on the stand so the shadow pattern remains constant. You'll see several different types of lights and shadows on and around the egg. Between the light and shadow areas on the "face," you'll see the halftone. (You'll always see the halftone on planes where the light is deflected from the face and glances off of it.)

Now draw the egg, indicating the light, shadow and halftone areas as you see them, and letting your strokes go across the form. You now have your first "head." Add the mouth, ears, hair and a neck, if you wish.

###  _Experiment_

Make twenty drawings of egg heads, tipping your egg slightly to the right and left. Also try turning it a quarter turn to the right, then left, or looking up or down. For three-quarter views you may need to add another vertical line from top to bottom halfway around on both sides to place the ears.

**Note:** When you add mouth lines to your ovals, think of the mouth line as closer to the nose mark, not halfway between the nose and the base of the egg.

**Cast Shadows and Reflected Light**

On a real head, you'll also notice cast shadows and reflected light. A _cast shadow_ is created by something blocking the light. It is important but is somewhat subtle. In portraits we see it, for instance, when the nose casts its shadow on the curve of the cheek or on the area between the nose and the upper lip. Or when the chin, as it projects, casts its shadow on the cylinder of the neck. The cast shadow tells us something about the size and the shape of the object casting the shadow. It also describes the contour of the surface on which the shadow falls. It makes the features look "real" (three-dimensional) and tells us the light direction.

A final element to consider in modeling form is reflected light, which, in a way, is the opposite of a cast shadow. When the light source shines so brightly that the light bounces off a light-colored shape, like a shirt or blouse, and back onto the face, the bounced light is aptly termed _reflected light_. Reflected light is subtle, and never as light as the halftone. If you make the reflected light too light, the solidity of the form will be destroyed.

**A) Light:** The part of the head facing the light source.

**B) Shadow:** The area of the head facing away from the light source, where direct light does not strike.

**C) Halftone:** The plane of the face that exists at an angle to the light source, so light is deflected and glances off. It is not light, not shadow, but a side plane. On a rounded form like the face, the halftone is the transition area between the light plane and the shadow plane.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing a Male Head in Profile

When drawing the head, it's important to know what to look for even before you have a model. Here you'll find methods of constructing the head and for accurately drawing proportions for heads from babyhood to old age. Draw the diagrams again and again until you can do them with ease. Copy the diagrams at first, then draw from imagination. Don't use mechanical devices; try to train your eye to judge relationships. Think about what you're doing.

You'll need a pen or pencil, paper, kneaded eraser, and ruler (also graph paper, if you wish) for these exercises. For a change of pace, you may want to draw the proportional divisions you'll work with here over photographs of heads in magazines. This should help carry you from the idealized proportions you'll learn here to actual ones of real people of all ages. You'll be amazed at the variety you'll find.

Since the most basic way to get a likeness is in profile, we'll begin with that. The drawings you'll study are based on 2-inch (5cm) squares, each divided into four 1-inch (3cm) squares. On your paper, make several squares in ink (or use graph paper), and chart the heads on them in pencil. In actuality, the life-size head of a six-foot (2m) tall male make would measure 9 inches (23cm) from the top of the skull to the bottom of the chin, and 9 inches (23cm) from the tip of the nose to the back of the skull.

**1** Place the eye on the horizontal halfway mark ( _1–3_ ) as if the line passed through the lower eyelid. (The eye is actually halfway down the head.)

**2** Divide the left edge of the square into seven equal parts. Try to measure by eye, not with a ruler.

**3** The eyebrow sits at line _c_ , along with the forward projection of the skull above the eyeball.

**4** The bottom of the nose sits at _e_ , halfway between the brow line and chin line. There is a wing of cartilage flaring over the nostril, and the bottom of the curve is on line _e_. The tip of the nose may turn up above that line or curve down below it.

**5** The top of the ear also lines up with the eyebrow at _c_. The bottom of the earlobe lines up with _e_ at the base of the nose. The ear is placed at the vertical halfway mark ( _2–4_ ) extending toward the back of the skull.

**6** Draw the forehead up from _c_ in a squared curve to top center _2_ and continue in the squared curve to _3_ at the back of the skull. Continue the curve until a point level with the base of the nose and ear is reached, lined up with _e_ , forming the base of the skull.

**7** The mouth is between _e_ and _f_ , with the lower lip projecting above _f_. Drop a chin line to _g_ on the bottom line and extend it to _h_.

**8** Now, with a slight curve, draw the jawline from _h_ to the back of the skull with a dashed line.

**9** Sketch a light diagonal line from the brow projection at _c_ through _h_ under the chin for the front of the neck.

**10** Parallel to the line you just drew, draw a diagonal line from the top of the skull at _2_ , through the base of the skull for the back of the neck.

####  _Exercise_

Further Practice

Now for some fun. Place tracing paper over the charted head you just drew and add hair, a beard, a hooked nose or a receding chin. No two heads are alike, but the charts will help you learn what to look for in the people around you and in models who pose for you. Draw twenty heads a day until you become fluent at this.

**Basic Male Head**

This is an example of a classic male head.

**Add More Hair**

The same man with longer hair, a mustache and a beard. Warning:draw beards with extreme care, or the man will resemble a dog.

**Elderly Male Head**

This man is about eighty. His teeth are gone, so the lower part of his face has become shorter (as it is with an infant). The fatty tissue has disappeared, making the skin less firm and the bones under the skin more visible. Gravity has the greatest effect in aging all of us — eyelids, nose and cheeks are all pulled downward. The spine is less erect and the head extends farther forward.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing a Female Head in Profile

Again, begin with a 2-inch (5cm) square divided into four 1-inch (3cm) squares. The process is much the same as for the male profile except that the forms are softer, so try using more curved lines than straight. The life-size head of a female of average height measures 8¼ inches (21cm) from the tip of the nose to the back of the skull, and 8¼ inches (21cm) from the top of the skull to the bottom of the chin.

**1** Place the eye on the halfway mark — the line would be through the center of the pupil if the eye were looking straight ahead. The front edge of the eyelid may be drawn approximately one-third of the distance from the left side of the square ( _a–f_ ) to the center vertical line ( _2–4_ ).

**2** After dividing the left edge of the 2-inch (5cm) square into seven equal parts, draw the brow and the skull projection at _c_. In females the eyebrow is often higher and more curved than in males.

**3** Put the base of the nose at _e_ , halfway between the brow and the bottom of the chin.

**4** The top of the ear is on a line with _c_ , the bottom of the earlobe and base of the nose are at _e_ , and the front of the ear is at the center vertical line ( _2–4_ ).

**5** Note that her forehead is much more curved than the male's. Draw this line from _c_ curving to the top of the skull at _2_ , around to the back of the head at _3_ , still curving to a point level with _e_ , the base of the nose.

**6** Place the mouth between _e_ and _f_.

**7** Drop a curving chin line to _g_. Sketch a jawline from _g_ to the base of the skull.

**8** Since the female neck is more slender and often longer than the male neck, try drawing a slightly curved diagonal from _c_ at the brow, back and down, so that the pit of the neck lines up under the earlobe.

**9** Parallel to the line you've just drawn, draw a slightly curved diagonal from the top of the skull at _2_ , touching the top of the ear, to the base of the skull for a guideline indicating the back of the neck.

####  _Exercise_

Further Practice

After making several charts, place tracing paper over the head and draw the woman with some hair. Change her hairstyle — maybe to your own. Note how these changes affect her age and personality. Try at least ten different looks. Draw her middle-aged, then make her eighty years old.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing an Infant Head in Profile

An infant's head is quite different from an adult's. The face itself (eyes, nose and mouth) takes up a relatively small area of the head, the face is much flatter, and there is virtually no chin.

An infant's face is sometimes nearly lost in fatty tissue. In profile, the cheeks can totally obscure the corners of the mouth. The distance from the nose to the chin is quite short, since there are no teeth. The eyes appear very large in the tiny face because the eyeballs are nearly the size of an adult's. Very little of the white of the eye is visible, but that which is observable is blue-white. The skull is sometimes flatter and longer rather than round. Infants usually don't have very much hair.

**1** Most babies have almost invisible eyebrows, but place a small eyebrow mark on the horizontal line ( _1–3)_.

**2** Divide the lower half of the left edge of the square, at the face, into four equal segments.

**3** Draw the eye at _a_ , also a very shallow bridge of the nose. The eye is very round.

**4** Make a small bump of a nose between _a_ and _b_ , and a projecting upper lip at _b_. Very often this upper lip protrudes even beyond the nose.

**5** Pull way back and place a very tiny lower lip at _c_.

**6** Add a round receding chin, very small, between _c_ and _d_. A curving fold of fat rather than a jawline is evident here.

**7** Place the ear, halfway back on the skull, from the brow line ( _1–3)_ down as far as the base of the nose.

**8** Add a very round skull curving from _1_ up to _2_ then to _3_. At the back its base is on a level with _b_ , the upper lip.

**9** The infant's and child's head sits on a straight neck, but it is very short and not easily seen until the little one sits up at about six months old. The head does not project forward as does the adult's.

####  _Exercise_

Further Practice

A child's head is also quite different from an adult's. Pay close attention to the proportions and the positions of the features.

**Children**

When the child is four or five years old, the face is still quite small in proportion to the entire head, but the eye has "moved up" from the infant proportion. This is because there is more mass in the lower quarter of the face — there are now upper and lower teeth and a jaw that has grown to accommodate them. This lengthens the facial mask. Study the illustration here and see if you can draw a child's head with similar features.

**Preteens**

As the child matures, the eye "moves up" until it reaches the halfway line at adulthood. This child is eleven or twelve years of age. Baby fat has gone and is replaced by more clearly defined features.

It's quite difficult for an artist to get a child's age right at any stage of life, but children from age eleven to fifteen are a challenge to the best of us. Extra-careful observation is the key.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing Adult Heads, Front View

The major difference between the frontal view and the profile view is that the entire head, seen from the front, is considerably more narrow. A male head, 9 inches (23cm) high, is 6½ inches (17cm) wide, with the maximum width just above the ears. The vertical proportions do not differ from the previous profile diagrams, that is, the eyes are halfway down the head at the horizontal line ( _1–3_ ), the base of the nose is halfway between _c_ (the brow line) and _g_ (the chin line).

A rule of thumb says the head (on the eye line) is five eye-lengths across. The outer two eye-lengths are normally somewhat obscured by hair.

The corners of the mouth (when it's not smiling) often fall in a line directly beneath the pupils of the eyes. The neck of the athletic male is as wide as the jaw, while the adult female neck is often more slender.

To make your own charts, copy these proportions onto a larger piece of paper or place tracing paper over these drawings and copy the basic structural lines. Then fill in the squares with your own versions of these heads, working freehand from the instructions provided here.

**Adult Male, Front View**

**Add Hair and Collar**

####  _Exercise_

Further Practice

Using the diagrams you have made, give your male and female drawings hair and collars. Try several more with different physical characteristics. Vary the race, the age. Add beards or eyeglasses. Remember, glasses must sit on the _bridge_ of the nose and inside the top of the ears. Look at candid photographs in newspapers and magazines for ideas; every person is unique.

Try ten profile views one day, ten front views another, giving yourself at least four days on each view until you can draw the diagrams comfortably and without strain. Later you'll need only the vertical and horizontal proportional lines as corrective checks in case you get into trouble on a head.

###  _Exercise_

Children's Proportions, Front View

Children are not that different from adults. Just remember, the younger the child, the lower the eye line. And the child's head is wider in relation to its length, giving the whole head a more round appearance. As the child grows older, the eyes move up to the halfway eye line, and the face (along with the entire body) loses the baby fat, becoming less round and more elongated.

##  _Drawing_ the Features

**Molly in Blue Glasses**

Watercolor on 140-lb. (300gsm) cold press 7½″ × 10″ (19cm × 25cm)

Every day of our lives we look at the eyes, noses and mouths of our own faces and those of our companions. Indeed, we are so familiar with these features that in order to draw them we must step back and rediscover each one. To accomplish this we will try to reduce the eye, nose, mouth and ear to their most basic components. In doing so, we will become more aware of their construction and form.

You may wonder why you will be asked, over and over again, to study your own face in a mirror. I have the best of reasons. The mirror studies that follow the description of each feature will help you become more observant. A fine portrait painter is sensitive to the most infinitesimal changes in shape and aspect of the facial features. The portraits you paint can record only what you've seen. Seeing is even more important than understanding color or knowing how to handle the brush. My most important obligation in writing this book is to help you to learn to see.

###  _The Eyes_

The _eye_ is actually a ball that rests in an opening in the skull known as the _orbital cavity_. Held in place by muscles and ligaments, the eye is protected by _eyelids_. These folds of skin close over the ball. They are made up of soft tissue and conform easily to the spherical eyeball.

The eyelids have thickness, easily perceived when you study them. Because of this thickness, the upper lid casts a shadow upon the ball. At the edge of both upper and lower eyelids is a fringe of fine hairs, the _eyelashes_ , which keep out dust particles and foreign matter and further protect the eyeball.

At the inner corner of the eye opening, near the nose and just over the tear duct, is a small pocket, which is pink inside. This inner corner of the eye is most often lower than the outer corner.

The colored part of the eye is the _iris_. Shadowed by the upper eyelid, it appears to be darker at the top. It is often shaded like an empty bowl.

The _pupil_ in the center of the iris is black. It's actually an opening into the eyeball that admits light to the retina and enables us to see. The pupil grows larger in dim light, allowing more light to be admitted. In very bright light the pupil contracts to protect the _retina_ (the light-sensitive membrane lining the inner eyeball).

The eyes move together — looking up, down, left or right. And they always look wet and shiny because they are always bathed in tears.

The _eyebrow_ follows the bone forming the upper edge of the orbital cavity. Where the light hits this bone, the brow appears lighter. This brow bone is called the _superciliary arch_.

The eyes are the very best indicators of mood, of emotion. As many have said, they are the "very windows of the soul."

**Observing the Eyes**

Begin your study of the eye by observing your own features in a mirror. That way you don't have to look for someone to pose, and you can study each feature as intently as you like without embarrassing your sister.

Find a place in fairly good light where you can sit or stand. You may want to use your easel for this study. You'll also need a hand mirror for the profile views, unless you have a three-way mirror.

Move your head slowly to one side, then the other, and notice how the shape of the eye opening changes. Now, move your head up and back so you're looking down your nose at the mirror. See how much smaller the eyes look? Move your head down, chin on chest, and look up at your eyes in the mirror; now they look quite round.

Scrutinizing your eyes this closely you may find that one eye is larger, or higher, or has a droopier eyelid. This is quite normal — don't be alarmed. Not one face in a million is perfectly symmetrical. Indeed, your close observation of these deviations from the expected will give you your likeness. Generalizing the forms you see takes away character and personality from your portrait.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing the Eyes, Front View

You will need a soft pencil, drawing paper and kneaded eraser for this study — and the mirror, of course.

1 Start with the sphere of the eye, lightly drawn. (Even though you can't see it, you know it's there.) Draw a second sphere, leaving an eye's width between.

2 Draw the eyelids curving over the sphere. Notice the lower lid has a different contour from the upper lid. And the upper lid casts a shadow upon the eyeball. Without this shadow, the eye will be too prominent.

Now add the tear duct where the upper and lower eyelids intersect, next to the nose. Draw the fold line in the upper lid, and add some shadow to indicate the depression next to the bridge of the nose. Is there a fold line under the eye?

3 Draw the eyebrows. Remember the brow is made up of many small hairs; it's drawn with short strokes, not one continuous line. Lay in any shadows you see under the brow bone, and under the lower lid. Erase the eyeball circle line.

4 Put in the round, colored iris. If you open your eyes very wide, you'll see the entire circle; without stretching your eyes open, either the top or the bottom, or, most likely, both the top _and_ the bottom will be covered by the lids. It's unusual to see the entire iris. Look carefully for the shiny white highlight, and leave that tiny area of the paper white (or you can lift it out later with the eraser).

Now add the black pupil in the center of the iris. Make this very dark.

Study the right eye. Add the eyelashes only where you see them. Check the alignment of the two pupils by laying your pencil horizontally across them, making sure you are holding it straight and not tilted. (This method is indispensable and also works well on aligning the ears, and straightening up the mouth or the nostrils.)

**Finishing Up**

Check your work by looking at your drawing in the mirror. This is a foolproof way to spot errors. Is one eye larger, or lower, or off in any way? Correct any errors you find. Add any accents you see. For example, you may wish to add an extra dark shadow under the upper lid. Or darken the upper third of the iris, which adds considerable depth to the eyes. Or you may want to add small dots of extreme dark or extreme light to add the "snap" that gives the eyes life.

As you draw other people's eyes, try to get the age group right. For example, glamorous eyes with long sweeping eyelashes would be inappropriate on a child. Can you show wisdom in the eyes of someone who has lived quite a long time?

It's safe to say you will never be bored drawing eyes, for everyone's eyes are unique. The variety is infinite.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing Eyes in the Profile

The only way you can study your own eye in profile is to look at it in a second mirror, such as at a hand mirror reflecting your image from a wall mirror. (You can also use a three-way mirror if you have one.) This may seem a little cumbersome, but the information gained from this study is well worth it.

1 Begin with the lightly drawn sphere. Of course you can see only one eye when looking at the eyes in profile, for the other eye is hidden behind the nose, on the other side of the head.

Draw the curve of the upper eyelid, then the lower lid. You will be unable to see the tear duct pocket.

2 Add the eyebrow, then the shadow under the brow, if there is one, and the shadow under the lower lid.

Study the iris. You see that it is no longer round from this angle, but is a flattened disk shape, and a part of it will be hidden by the eyelid. The highlight is even smaller in this view; study it carefully and try to leave it the white of the paper when coloring in the iris. If you can't manage this, pick it out with your kneaded eraser.

Now draw the pupil, which is also a flattened disk shape, very dark. The darker you make the area surrounding the highlight, the brighter the highlight will appear. Put in the eyelashes, which are much more prominent in the profile view. Then add the accents.

Finally, erase the lines indicating the sphere.

**Practice Hint**

Try drawing some eyes in profile by observing other people. These are easier than full-face eyes, for they don't have to be looking at you. If you keep at this, you'll soon find you can do an eye quite quickly.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing the Eyes, Three-Quarter View

This view requires even more careful observation than the full face or the profile. Most of the heads you will paint will be in a three-quarter view as this angle appears most natural and least posed. Look in a mirror and draw your own eyes, but each time you look, be sure your head is in precisely the same position as before. A ½-inch (12mm) turn to the right or left changes the perspective of the eyes.

**Three-Quarter Movement**

The three-quarter view is less static than the full face or profile. More movement is indicated because the head is facing one way, but the eyes are looking another.

1 Draw the two spheres and then draw the eyelids over the spheres. Immediately you'll see why this view needs careful observation: the left eye is very different from the right. Coloring in the irises should help with the eyelids. (Try to leave the highlight white.) Add the fold line in the upper lid with care, then the tear duct. See how the inner corner of the eye farthest away from you is partially hidden by the bridge of the nose. You may not even see the tear duct of that eye.

2 Add the pupils, very black. Leave the highlights the white of the paper or lift them with an eraser. Add the eyelashes only where you see them. Draw the eyebrows. Then look for shadows. Usually there are shadows on both sides of the bridge of the nose at the inner corner of the eye, but don't add them unless you see them. Is there a shadow under the lower lid, and at the outer corner of the eyes? Erase the sphere where it is still visible.

#####  _Experiment_

Draw as many pairs of eyes as you can from life, magazines and photographs, every day for a month. This effort will be of enormous benefit to you. I believe it's safe to say that the success of your portraits depends upon your finesse in drawing and painting eyes.

###  _Variations in Eyes_

Compare these drawings of eyes. The open gaze of a baby is quite different from the complex scrutiny of a man who has seen much and met many challenges.

Study and analyze these drawings of eyes. To see them more abstractly, turn this book upside down. This will make you even more aware that it's the texture that makes the eyebrows, that it's the broken and uneven line that gives action and structure to the eyes, that it is the placing of the very darkest dark next to the brightest white — the accents — that gives the eyes sparkle and life. Look at the page again right side up and you'll see that it's the way the dark pupils are placed that makes the two eyes focus.

Every artist has his own way, and you will too. You can learn from every portrait you see.

Eyes of an Asian infant

Eyes of a thirty-five-year-old man

Eyes of a fifty-year-old man

Eyes of a sixty-five-year-old man

**Common Errors**

  * **Making all edges too hard.** Keep the edges of the eyelids soft, saving crisp touches for accents. Keep the edge of the iris against the white of the eye relatively soft. Breaking the line of the lids helps add life to the portrait.

  * **Putting in too many eyelashes or making them too distinct.** Use restraint when indicating eyelashes. Nothing cheapens your work like having too many eyelashes lined up around the eyes like spidery legs. Remember, too, eyelashes are seen in perspective, with some coming directly at you.

  * **Making eyelashes too dark.** These can make a child appear too old, too sophisticated and very un-childlike, as if made up with mascara.

  * **Making the highlights in the eyes too white or too large.** Placing the highlight in the eye is certainly fun, but if you don't restrain yourself here you diminish the quality of your work considerably. Sometimes you may see a highlight in only one eye — if so, paint it that way. Also, try to decide which eye has the most dominant highlight. Is one eye larger? Brighter?

  * **Painting the whites of the eyes too white.** Careful observation of value is important here. Squint very hard to help you see them clearly. The next time you're in a museum, hold a piece of white paper in front of a favorite portrait; you will see instantly how far from white the eyeballs are.

###  _The Nose_

The nose can be challenging, probably because it projects. We must understand the construction of the nose before we can draw or paint this feature. The following facts will help you.

**Observing the Nose**

The nose begins where it meets the forehead and brow in an inverted wedge shape between the eyes and at the level of the eyebrows. Narrowing at the bridge, it then widens as it travels down the face toward the bulbous tip. On either side of the tip, the nose flares out, forming covering for the nostrils. The underplane recedes (which is hard to indicate from the front) and progresses to the _philtrum_ (the indentation between the nose and the upper lip).

The wedge-shaped area where the nose meets the forehead and brows is the _keystone_ area. There is a delicate shadow here and a light just under it where the _bridge_ of the nose is indented, the spot where eyeglasses rest when they are worn. Work out this wedge and bridge area with extreme care. Don't overwork it.

Nostrils are dark, but don't indicate them as black holes. Just incorporate them into the shadow area beneath the nose. When working in color, always make the nostrils warm, a reddish hue.

**Cartilage-Bone Juncture**

The nose itself is made of cartilage. When you really look at this area, you will perceive the slightest shadow across the form where the nasal bone ends and the soft cartilage begins. Study these drawings. Notice that if there is a bump in the nose, it is usually at this point where the bony structure comes to an end. You really need this change in plane to express the individuality and character of the nose on the portrait you are painting. When drawing the nose, break your highlight here.

**Beneath the Surface**

The nasal bone extends downward from the frontal bone of the skull and ends at the nasal cavity.

**Basic Facts**

  * The nose is always centered between the eyes and is narrowest at the top, or bridge.

  * The nose is a vertical form and is normally straight from top to bottom. If the nose has been injured or broken, it may veer slightly to the right or left.

  * The two openings at the base of the nose on the bottom receding plane are the _nostrils_. Very often these are not clearly seen from the front view, and sometimes not even from the side view.

  * The nose has far less mobility than the eyes or the mouth. The nostrils can dilate, and the nose can wrinkle, but these movements are fairly infrequent and rarely occur in portraits. The only other way the nose changes is when the subject is smiling. Then it appears wider as the nostrils are stretched laterally.

####  _Exercise_

Drawing the Nose, Front View

Looking in the mirror, study your nose and try to see it as a triangular block projecting from the facial surface. You can't really see a line where the side plane of the nose meets and changes to the front plane of the cheek, but it helps to imagine such a line. It's easier to feel it than to see it. Press hard enough to feel the side planes of your nose, then the cheeks. (Also feel the higher cheekbones and the edges of the eye sockets all around your eyes.)

You'll need a soft pencil, your sketch paper, a kneaded eraser, and a mirror for these exercises.

1 Start to draw. Begin with the deep indentations on either side of the bridge of the nose, near the inner corners of the eyes. Then make a mark at the base of the nose. Whenever you draw any form, always lightly indicate its boundaries first. You can't just begin at one end and hope that all will come out right at the finish.

2 Lightly draw the triangular shape of the nose. Thinking of the nose form as a solid block, draw the side plane on the shadow side, the side plane on the lighter side, and the top plane. It's important that you begin your noses this way, even if you do not actually see all three of these planes (it will help you understand the structure). The lines defining the planes can always be erased later.

3 Now draw the fleshy rounded ball of the nose, with rounded lines. Then draw the flaring winglike shapes on either side. Indicate the bottom plane of the solid triangular block. Draw a light line where the side plane of the wing-forms turn under, and where the top and front of the ball become the underside.

The nose casts a shadow on the cheek and the philtrum (the indented area between the nose and the upper lip). Add any shadows you see, but don't go too dark. Look for the outer shape of the cast shadow; it will help define the shape of the form it's falling on.

Is there reflected light, bouncing up onto the bottom plane? Lighten your shadow area there just enough.

Erase the construction lines. Add small dark accents for more definition. Round off forms where necessary. Lift out the highlights at the bridge of the nose just below the keystone shadow, on the bony part of the nose, and for the shine on the tip of the nose — the brightest, most obvious highlight.

**Making the Nose Project**

There are three ways to get the nose to project:

  1. Make the shadows on the side plane and the underplane of the nose darker than the shadow on the side plane of the face, going back toward the ear.

  2. Draw the tip of the nose crisply, not softly. (Hard edges project!)

  3. Make the highlight on the tip of the nose crisp and sharp.

**Making the Nose Less Noticeable**

Conversely, to subdue a too-prominent nose you can de-emphasize it as follows:

  1. Keep the shadows on the side plane and the underplane of the nose fairly light, or mid-value. Also minimize the shadows cast by the nose.

  2. Keep descriptive lines soft.

  3. Play down the highlight on the tip of the nose.

**Common Errors**

  * **Running a highlight down the entire length of the nose.** You will never see a highlight running from the nose bridge to the tip, straight, all the way down.

  * **Not showing a delineation at the point where the bridge of the nose meets the forehead.** You will never see a nose come straight down from the forehead (the frontal bone) without a change in plane. There is always an indentation at the nose bridge. You don't always have to note this keystone underplane with shadow; you can indicate it with a change in color temperature.

  * **Making black holes for nostrils.** Remember, your model is alive. Just under the skin is a capillary system with blood flowing constantly. All the openings in the head are warm. In paint, mix some reds into the nostril color. In drawing, don't make these openings too black. The nostrils in the portrait become part of the shadow under the nose.

  * **Making the shadow under the nose on the area above the upper lip, or beside the nose on to the cheek, too solid or too dark.** Shadows should be luminous and transparent, so these shadows must be underplayed. If they are very dark on your drawing or painting, they appear to create a "hole" in the face.

  * **Cast shadow from the nose, hitting the lip.** If you ever see the shadow under the nose reaching down as far as the lip, change the lighting. The younger the model, the lighter the shadow under the nose.

####  _Exercise_

Drawing the Nose in Profile

To complete this exercise, study your nose from the side in a second mirror. This appears easier than drawing the nose in the front view, but this is only partly true. While you can more easily perceive the shape in profile and therefore more easily draw it, it's more difficult to make it appear solid. This is one of the problems you'll encounter in drawing any of the features, and even the head itself: The drawing will look flat in profile, like a silhouette.

1 Block the nose in as a triangular shape projecting from the facial surface.

2 Then start at the top with the keystone area between the brows. Look for the curved indentation at the bridge. The nose then projects from the bridge, rounds off at the tip, and recedes to the area above the upper lip. Add the curved wing growing into the cheek, then the nostril.

**Making the Nose Project**

To give a feeling of solid form to the profile nose, you can shadow the underplane. Add a cast shadow from the nose form onto the upper lip area. Put in the halftone on the top plane and on the side plane of the nose, leaving the lights and highlights as white paper.

One way to avoid this flat appearance is to turn your head just enough to see the eyelashes behind the nose. Now you can draw the nose more solidly and, incidentally, the mouth as well. Follow the same order of activity as in the "flat" profile: draw the keystone area first, then the indentation at the bridge of the nose. As you move down the nose, there is the top plane, the front plane at the tip, and the underplane. Do include the lines dividing each plane, to indicate your understanding of the division between these planes and the side plane. On the side plane, draw the curved wing over the nostril, then the nostril itself, if it's visible. Look at the illustrations. Don't you agree that these noses look more solid?

####  _Exercise_

Drawing the Nose, Three-Quarter View

Study your nose in the mirror in a three-quarter view. The triangular block shape works for this view too; because the block is in perspective, the nostril on the far side is only partially seen, or suggested.

1 Lightly indicate the angle of the nose. Starting at the keystone area between the brows, block in the top plane, the side plane nearest you, and any suggestion of the far side plane that you see. If you don't see any, leave that plane out.

2 Draw the wing area covering the nostril. Define the ball or rounded area, and the slight shadow where the ball meets the bridge. Is there shadow on the side plane?

3 Is there a front plane at the tip of the nose? If so, indicate the underplane as the nose recedes to the facial plane. Then draw the nostril.

Pick out the highlights on the bridge area and the bony area, and the main highlight on the ball.

**Changing Views and Angles**

Slight changes in the view of the head can easily throw you off, and you'll be frustrated knowing your drawing isn't right without really knowing why. This drawing shows how changing the head's position changes the relationships of the features.

Each time you look up from your drawing to study the nose, make sure you see the nose at precisely the same angle as before. You can check the angle by taking careful note of how much of the cheek you can see beyond the nose.

**Nose Angle Tip**

If it's hard to determine the angle of the nose, hold your pencil up and align it with the angle of the nose in the mirror, then place your pencil carefully on the paper at that same angle.

###  _The Mouth_

People who are not artists believe that the eyes are the hardest part of the head to draw, but in my opinion, the eyes are simple compared to the mouth. Each time a new thought passes through your model's mind her mood changes, and the expression around the mouth changes as well. Anger, boredom, fatigue, disdain, petulance — all these feelings and a million more show around the mouth. Let me give a word of advice: When you're working on your portrait and you get to a stage where the mouth is just right, leave it alone! You can lose the likeness in a split second by adding just that "one last touch" to the mouth.

The lip tissue is darker in value and warmer in color than the surrounding skin. When the mouth is open and lips are parted, we see the teeth. Infants have very full, soft, rounded lips. In old age, the lips become thinner.

The upper lip is often in shadow, as it is a receding plane. The lower lip catches the light, as it is a projecting plane.

The mouth is the most challenging part of the portrait for the artist because it is constantly changing, but the changes are usually extremely subtle. As John Singer Sargent once said, "A portrait is a picture in which there is just a tiny little something not quite right about the mouth."

**Lip Breakdown**

The upper lip is made up of three parts, the lower lip of two.

**Lip Line**

The line between the upper and lower lip should be broken, varied in weight and intensity.

**Soft Edges**

Don't draw firm dark lines around or between the lips. The edges must be drawn or painted softly, particularly on women and children.

Note the way the corners of the mouth tuck into the adjoining cheeks. Do they go up? Down? How dark are they? If you paint them too dark, the mouth will appear tight.

**Mouth Observations**

Study your mouth. See how soft the lip tissue appears. The center of the upper lip projects, and the corners recede as they go back into the cheeks. Turn your head slowly to one side. As you approach a three-quarter view, the far corner of the mouth tucks in and disappears. Do the same to the other side.

**Children's Mouths**

A child's upper lip is frequently much larger and more protruding than the very small lower lip, for the lower jaw is undeveloped.

**Angled Down**

Put your chin down on your chest and notice how the mouth curves around the teeth. The corners go up now; they go up even more when you smile. The upper lip appears thinner than the lower lip.

**Angled Up**

Now raise your chin, putting your head back. See how the mouth curves around the teeth. The corners of your mouth point down in this perspective. Try smiling. What happens then? The lower lip appears thinner than the upper lip.

####  _Exercise_

Drawing the Mouth, Front View and in Profile

Complete these exercises to practice drawing the mouth in frontal and profile view.

**Front View**

1 Studying your mouth in a mirror, indicate with a light line where you want the mouth to be on your paper. Look first for the corners of the mouth and place them.

2 The line between the lips comes next. Try not to draw this as one continuous line, but break it somewhere. This break softens the mouth and prevents a tense expression.

3 Now form the upper lip, developing it from the three oval parts. The light coming from the upper left or upper right throws the top lip into shadow. Add this tone.

4 Note the vertical indentation from the nose down to the lip (the philtrum) and the shadow on the plane slanting back toward the cheek. Men have facial hair growing here, which tends to darken this area.

5 Place the shadow under the lower lip as it travels down to the chin. Look for the highlight on the lower lip. Leave it the white of the paper, or lift it out with your eraser. Put in the dark accents in the corners of the mouth or between the lips. Tuck in the corners of the mouth.

Don't draw lines around the lips. The value difference between the lip tissue and the surrounding skin is hardly discernible in a drawing.

**Profile View**

1 Now let's try drawing the mouth in profile. Holding a mirror at the side of your face and looking at the reflection of your mouth in a second mirror, block in the mouth by first indicating the angle of the line between the lips.

2 Block in, in a straight line, the angle of projection of your lips. Is the upper lip protruding more — or the lower?

3 Tuck in the corner of the mouth.

4 Darken the upper lip if it appears to be in shadow.

5 Add the shadow under the lower lip and at the corner of the mouth. Keep the edges soft where the shadow blends into the light. Is the lower lip darker than the skin surrounding it? Add this tone if you see it. Now, with your eraser, pick out the highlight. You'll find the mouth is there without lines circumscribing it.

####  _Exercise_

Drawing the Mouth, Three-Quarter View

Drawing the mouth in three-quarter view can be challenging. Pay close attention to the shapes to draw this view accurately.

1 Study your mouth in the mirror. Keeping your lines soft, draw the line between the lips, and break it somewhere.

2 Lightly block in the upper lip by drawing the three ovals. Squint hard. Where do you see shadow? In the philtrum? On the shadow side of the lips from the center to the far corner of the mouth?

3 Tuck in the corners of the mouth. On the far side, the side turned away from you, the corner may not be visible at all. Don't put it in if you don't see it.

4 Add the shadow under the lower lip. Is the upper lip in shadow? Should the corners of the mouth be accented with darks? If the lips are darker than the surrounding skin tone, darken them. Now lift out the highlight with your eraser.

**Common Errors**

  * **Handling the mouth too heavily.** Use a very light touch on any mouth. To avoid making the mouth look weak, search out small points where you can place an accent, such as the corners of the mouth, under the lower lip, or on the line between the lips. Very often, these accents in and around the mouth will produce the likeness you want. Above all, do not draw lines around the lips.

  * **Making the teeth too white, so they appear to protrude.** On the other hand, if the teeth are too dark they'll appear to be discolored or decayed. Strong lines between the teeth will also look like decay or spaces between teeth.

  * **Making the highlight on the mouth too glossy.** This will diminish the character of your portrait because it's too distracting.

###  _Smiles and Teeth_

Perhaps this is a good time to talk about teeth, while we are discussing the mouth. You probably didn't think you would be painting teeth! However, many people don't look natural with their mouths closed, and the teeth are an essential part of their likeness.

Just as the mouth curves with the front of the face, the teeth follow this same curve. The two front teeth are at least an inch ahead of the chewing molars.

Study the variety of mouths here. Try to see the teeth as a mass, not as separate bits like kernels on an ear of corn. Tuck the corners of this dental mass into the corners of the mouth well.

If you delineate the crevices between individual teeth, they will appear too prominent, as if the sitter had bad teeth and was ready for the dentist. The best way to indicate the individual teeth is to vary the color or the value ever so slightly, so as not to destroy the illusion of the teeth as one mass.

Look for the bottom edge design of the upper teeth. This line is often the key to an exact likeness.

When the mouth is open, the upper lips cast a shadow on the upper teeth. Be careful not to draw it as a continuous line across the teeth. Better to indicate the fact that the upper lip overhangs the teeth by painting very subtle marks within the shadow to show the divisions between the teeth, but so subtle that the observer is hardly even aware of them.

Occasionally when having trouble getting a really good likeness, I've found I was ignoring the lower teeth. These lower teeth show more frequently than you'd expect when your subject is speaking or smiling. Start carefully observing the mouths of your friends and family when they're talking with you — and watch for their lower teeth.

Notice that the mouths depicted here are drawn with curving lines, expressing the full rounded forms of the lips. These curves describe protruding forms.

With a pencil, practice drawing all the mouths we've looked at so far in this chapter. Use curving lines, keeping some edges soft and placing dark accents where they really count. Then practice drawing mouths from magazine photographs. Remember, the more mouths you draw, the more confident you will become in your ability to portray them.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing the Ear, Front View

Students think ears are more difficult to draw than they really are. Some dedicated observation will eliminate this fear. Whether ears are quite flat or protrude, it's convenient to think of them as flat oval disks set at the side of the head. The ear is made up of _cartilage_ , not bone, and has virtually no movement, so it doesn't change as one's expression changes.

In profile, the ear begins at the halfway mark between the front and the back of the head and extends toward the back. It also slants backward slightly, sometimes paralleling the line of the nose.

The inner line around the top of the ear seldom follows the outer shape exactly. Don't forget that both ears usually line up with each other and are seen in perspective when the head is tilted.

### Observing the Ears

Oddly enough, although ears usually don't contribute very much to the likeness, when they're incorrectly placed they can cause you a great deal of trouble. The face can be perfect, the ears beautifully drawn, but you'll sense there is something wrong. For students, the biggest problem seems to be aligning the ears with the eyebrow line and the base-of-the-nose line. Make sure you follow the curving eyebrow line when the head is tilting and hang the ears from that. Like the mouth, when the head is tilted back, the ears appear to be lower; head tilted forward, the ears appear higher.

Before you start to draw, sit up very straight, holding your head absolutely erect, and look in a mirror. Envision an imaginary line at the top of the ears and another at the bottom of the ears extending across the face.

Now tilt your head to the right or left and try to imagine the line across the bottom of the ears. It is much more difficult to get the ears properly placed when the head isn't posed straight up.

You will need a pencil, drawing paper, kneaded eraser and mirror for this exercise.

### Ear Alignment

On an adult, the ear extends in a vertical shape from the brow line to the base-of-the-nose line.

1 Block in the full-face diagram of the head using a light line to position the ears.

2 Think of the ear as a flat oval disk and begin drawing your ears with that form on both sides of the head. Now refine the outer shape of the disks into the actual shape of your ear.

3 Add the inner line curving around the top to form the rim or fold, called the _helix_. Now, define the bowl like indentation of the ear and the small flap at the lower area. Draw the small flap at the front of the ear opening.

Follow this procedure for both ears, completing both in one sitting. Does your hair cover part of your ears? Also, when you smile, do your cheeks cover part of your ears?

####  _Exercise_

Drawing the Ear in Profile

To draw your ear for this exercise, you'll need the two mirrors used for the profile view of the eye. As you sit up straight with your head erect, does the top of your ear line up with your eyebrow? Your eye? You will never get a good likeness in a profile if the ear is not correctly aligned with the other features, but many students don't realize this.

**Common Errors**

  * **Carelessly drawn**. The ear is often hurriedly stuck on in a rush at the end. Take your time, checking the alignment with the eyebrow line and the base-of-the-nose line.

  * **Not placed in proper perspective on the head.** Careful observation will ensure you're getting it right.

  * **Placed too high or too low.** This problem exists particularly when drawing children; ear placement greatly affects how old the child appears, especially in the front view. If you are having difficulty getting the child the right age, check ear placement. When in doubt, line up the top of the ear with the eyebrow line.

1 Draw a square profile diagram of the head as you learned in chapter one and lightly position the ear as indicated. Study your ear and draw it where you see it. Does it align with the ear you just sketched?

2 Draw light lines indicating the top, bottom, front and back of the ear. Then begin with the oval disk, slanting the top slightly toward the back of the head.

3 Now refine the outer shape of the ear, top to bottom.

4 Add the inner line inside the top of the oval. Form the fold (the helix), and carry it down to the lobe.

5 Draw in the circular line describing the deep bowl; follow it down to the two rigid flaps which protect the ear opening — one at the lower back, one at the front toward the face.

6 Add shadows and highlights. Now turn your head and draw your other ear. It is a different experience, drawing an ear from the opposite direction.

##  _Drawing_ the Body

**Britt**

Oil on canvas 48″ × 38″ (122cm × 97cm)

**W** hen we think of portraits we may automatically think of the head alone, but nearly every portrait you'll ever paint will include more of the subject's body than just the head. There will be the neck, perhaps the shoulders, frequently the torso, arms, and hands, and occasionally the legs and feet as well.

The material in this chapter will help you understand the construction of the parts of the body, how these parts inter-relate, and how their construction determines natural movement. To get to know the way the body moves, it's helpful, even fun, to draw from a jointed wooden mannequin. The adult-proportioned mannequin can be arranged in nearly any pose the human body will assume. These mannequins come in sizes from 12 inches (31cm) to 26 inches (66cm) high and stand upright on a wooden base. If you can't find them in your local art store, you can buy them from artist's supply catalogs.

###  _The Neck_

The neck is often erroneously drawn as just a tube extending from the head. In order to draw the neck accurately, it's helpful to understand the structure. This will help you to place it properly and will keep you from forcing the neck into unnatural positions.

Internally, the backbone connects to the base of the skull. Inside the neck are seven clavicle vertebrae that are each able to move, allowing for great flexibility. But it is the muscles that move the neck. The trapezius muscles at the shoulders and back provide strength to the neck, and are visible as part of the shoulders.

In a muscular neck, the sternomastoid muscles make a triangle pointing down to the collarbones, but in most people the muscles are less defined and are covered with smooth skin.

There are great differences in how the neck appears based on age and sex. In women, necks are slender and curved. On men they are often thicker and sturdier. In infants, the neck muscles are not yet defined so the necks are difficult to see. And as people age, the neck becomes thinner and the skin looser, so the muscles are more visibly prominent.

**Basic Structure**

The neck can be thought of as a cylinder, a very strong column rising from the sloping platform of the shoulders.

**Interior Structure**

There are seven vertebrae in the neck, each capable of movement, like links in a chain. This allows the head to turn and twist in every direction except 180 degrees to the back. Notice that the neck isn't perfectly straight. It projects forward even when we are sitting up very straight.

**Neck Musculature**

The strength of the neck is at the back, where the _trapezius muscles_ rise from well below the shoulder blades, and extend out to the shoulders and up to the base of the skull. These trapezius muscles hold the head erect.

**Key Points**

In the back, the neck begins at a point on a level with the ear opening and the base of the nose. From the front, the visible neck begins at the chin and extends this same distance downward to the collarbone protrusions.

Descending from behind the ears to a pit at the base of the front of the neck are two slender muscles called "bonnet strings" or _sternomastoid muscles_. These pull the head forward and back and allow the head to turn from side to side. Between these muscles, at the front, you will see the _larynx_ or Adam's apple, which is generally more prominent in males.

**Neck Flexibility**

Notice that the neck can be stationary and still allow the head to nod forward and be thrown back.

**Children's Necks**

Until a child is three or four months old, the neck is too weak to support the head, which is proportionately very large for the body. The neck in a newborn baby and up to age two is hardly visible as such, but may be indicated by creases in rolls of fatty tissue. As the child grows the neck becomes more perceptible and takes on a rather slender and delicate appearance.

**Youths' Necks**

The boy in this illustration is about ten years old, but when a boy of sixteen or seventeen becomes active in athletics, the neck thickens. As a portrait painter, you should watch for this, as a heavy, sturdier neck is a good way to indicate a young man growing out of boyhood. All professional athletes show great strength in the neck.

**Women's Necks**

In painting women, the neck might be made to appear longer and attractively curved as an indicator of feminine grace and beauty. No woman was ever beautiful with her head slumped forward, scrunched down into her shoulders. Every beauty holds her head high, with neck extended and erect.

Many portrait painters have stressed the beauty of the "swanlike" neck and the way the head is balanced on it to convey an impression of elegance in their subjects.

Michelangelo gave all his people sturdy necks, both men and women. There is something heroic about a very strong neck in a painted image.

**Common Errors**

  * **The neck is too long or too short.** That means it was poorly observed. Try to relate the neck to the chin and to the collar.

  * **Too thick or too thin.** If the neck is too heavy, the figure may look stodgy. If the neck is drawn too thin, the figure may appear weak.

  * **Drawn as a tube with a ball on top of it.** The neck looks stiff and unnatural.

  * **No involvement between the neck and the shoulders.** The body lacks grace and movement without the smooth flow from the neck to the torso.

###  _Shoulders and Torso_

The pit at the front base of the neck has two small bony protuberances rising on either side. These are the inner ends of the collarbones, the _clavicles_ , which attach at this central point to the breastbone or _sternum_. The opposite ends of these collarbones extend outward to the shoulders.

The shoulders appear as round and full forms. One shoulder can be raised independently of the other, but in most portraits the shoulders are at the same height or very near it, unless one elbow is leaning on the arm of a chair or something similar. As the elbow is higher, so is the shoulder.

The upper half of the torso is the cone-shaped rib cage called the _thorax_. This "cage" is constructed of the twelve curved ribs on either side, which connect to the sternum in the front and the spine of the back.

The upper back of the torso is relatively flat, for there is a flat shoulder blade, or _scapula_ , on either side of the spine partially covering the rib cage. The top edge of this scapula parallels the slope of the shoulder and is thicker at the outer corner where it forms the shoulder joint as a socket for the bone of the upper arm. As a person ages, the upper back becomes more rounded and less flat.

The torso is capable of twisting, bending from side to side, and bending forward and backward, but all this movement occurs only at the waist. The chest and the hips are relatively stationary.

The lower part of the torso is the _pelvis_ , which is made up of the flat _sacrum_ at the base of the spine and a hip bone on either side. The pelvis functions as one stationary unit and no part is capable of movement independently of the other two parts. The hip bones flare out at right angles to each other; each has a ridge at the top called the _iliac crest_ , which travels from the back to the front of the body. The lower front corners of these bones meet at the center front and form the _pubis_ , the lowest point at the front of the torso. At the outer edge of each hip bone is a socket fitted with the ball end of the femur, a necklike extension of the thigh bone.

###  _Drawing the Torso_

Stand up and raise your leg to the side, as if you were getting on a bicycle, and feel with your hand where the leg swings out. This spot, the hip line is critically important to the artist. When drawing the full-length figure, this is where the body divides in half vertically — that is, the distance from the top of the head to the hip line is an equal measure to the distance from the hip line to the soles of the feet. Also, when the arm is hanging straight down at one's side, this line aligns with the inner wrist. (See the diagram of the man, woman, and children near the end of the chapter.)

An artist visualizes this complex machine which is our body in terms of the most simple masses. Thus, blocking in the torso is accomplished quite effectively by drawing the thoracic area as an egg and the pelvic area as a block, and connecting the two with the flexible spine.

Just as the vertical center line and the horizontal center, or eye line, are of critical importance when blocking in the head, so the center line of the torso, both front and back, is extremely important in drawing your figure correctly. In anatomy, this is known as the _median line_. It's a good idea to use this line as a checkpoint if your figure drawing seems to be incorrect, particularly in the three-quarter view when your figure is in perspective.

And when you are painting portraits, the buttons of the shirt, jacket or blouse must fall on this center line, not on the edge of the garment.

**Front**

### Common Errors

  * **Body bending in the wrong places.** The body is not really a flexible sausage. There can only be movement front to back and side to side, and twisting movement at the waist, the area between the rib cage and the pelvis.

  * **Drawing or painting the figure's clothing awry.** The center front of the clothing must fall on the center front of the torso. This includes the V of an open shirt; where collars button and men's ties knot; or where buttons go down the front of a garment.

  * **Failing to account for uneven weight distribution.** Remember, when the figure is standing with the weight on one foot, the shoulder line and the hip line can never be parallel, or the figure would fall over.

  * **Getting the proportions wrong.** When painting a portrait of a seated figure, it's all too easy to shorten or leave out the part of the torso from the waist to the seat. Carefully measure head-lengths down to the chair seat, then to the knees. Imagine the body in a bathing suit, and block it in as you know, in your mind's eye, it must be. Then put the clothing on.

**Back**

**Side**

###  _The Arms_

The arms are capable of radial movement in any direction at the shoulder joint. At the elbow, only side-to-side and forward movement is possible. The upper arm is round and is made up of only one bone, the _humerus. Deltoid, biceps_ and _triceps_ muscles are prominent in the male. These muscles are less pronounced in the female.

The forearm is made up of two long bones, the _radius_ and the _ulna_. It is heaviest near the elbow, where it is round. Two-thirds of the way down it tapers to a flat mass at the wrist.

**Arm Widths**

By drawing a line across the upper chest through the mass of the deltoid muscles, at the heads of the humerus bones and slightly above the armpits, you'll discover the broadest part of the entire body. The shoulders are not broadest at their upper corners! Study the arm carefully; from this point of greatest thickness near the shoulders, the arm begins to taper until it becomes smallest at the wrist.

**Palm up**

**Palm down**

**Arm Bones**

Holding your hand flat, palm up, the ulna is on the little-finger side. This bone is larger at the elbow and smaller at the wrist. The radius is the bone on the thumb side, and is larger on the wrist end and smaller at the elbow end. When you turn your hand over, palm down, the position of the radius and the ulna don't change at the elbow end, but midway down the forearm the radius twists over the ulna, allowing the hand to lie flat in this position as well. Try this; with your hand, you can easily feel the interaction of these two bones.

**Drawing the Arms**

The most natural way to construct the arm is to block it in as two cylinders of approximately the same length: one for the upper arm, from the top of the shoulder to elbow; and one for the forearm, from the elbow to the wrist.

**Palm up**

**Palm down**

**Arm Bent**

There is a sharper angle at the outside of the elbow joint, a rounder curve inside. When the arm is bent (hands resting in your lap or elbow leaning on the arm of a chair), the point of the elbow is found under the center of the upper arm, not in a line with the back of the upper arm, as shown in line _A_.

**Common Errors**

**Making the arm too stringy and without form.** This is really the only major fault in drawing the arm. The bare arms on a muscular man are easy to draw, but try to paint the bare arms of an eight-year-old boy. Now there's a task to test your mettle! And slender young women, too — not so easy. The arms do look stringy, so you must add form and solidity.

**Note:** Put strokes (of paint or charcoal) across the form to indicate its roundness. Never paint an arm with longitudinal up-and-down strokes. The curve of a sleeve helps immeasurably, as does a watch or a bracelet, to make the arm appear round, so take advantage of them when you can.

###  _The Hands and Wrists_

Drawing hands takes a tremendous amount of practice. Your sitter's hands express another facet of his personality. They add character to a man's portrait, grace and poise to a woman's portrait, and charm to a child's portrait. And if you can't put in the hands, you're forever limited to just head and shoulder portraits — not much fun.

Here are some facts about the hand and wrist: The wrist is a form similar to a flat block, approximately twice as wide as it is thick. The wrist rotates with the hand on the forearm, as discussed in the previous section.

When the hand is at rest, palm up or palm down, in one's lap or on a table, the front of the wrist, on the thumb side, is higher than the little-finger side. Prove this to yourself by studying your own wrist and hand.

When the arm lies flat, palm down, on a flat surface, there is always a hollow under the wrist. The arm and hand never rest on the wrist, but on the heel of the hand and the fleshy part of the forearm near the elbow.

The hand is made up of two masses: the hand itself and the thumb. There are four bones in the hand mass, twelve in the fingers, and three in the thumb.

**Blocking in the Hand**

The hand is so complex a structure and capable of so many movements that most students are apprehensive about drawing or painting it. However, to the portrait painter, the hand is second in importance only to the head, adding so much to the character of the work that we absolutely must give it our best effort.

Palm up

Palm down

**Hand Shape**

Attempt to see the hand as a geometric form. Look at it as a mitten with thickness. This is a valid way to block in the hand in any medium and can be relied on to get you started on the hands in all the portraits you do.

This first form is a good beginning, but you'll never see a hand in this position — out flat — on real people, so we must explore further.

**Knuckles**

The knuckles (on the back of the hand) are halfway between the wrist and the end of the first finger, the _index finger_. Check this on your own hand. Let your blocked-in mitten bend at this point so that the "hand" appears more natural, slightly cupped. The middle finger is the longest and it determines the length of the hand.

**Finger and Hand Movement**

The finger section ( _A–B_ ) is jointed twice more and can bend forward at these joints all the way to a tight fold, a clenched fist.

The hand section ( _B–C_ ) is capable of movement at the wrist forward and backward and side to side.

###  _Construction of the Hand_

Pay careful attention to the construction of the hand by observing your own hand. Each finger (except the thumb) has the same basic structure, but they are of varying lengths so the segments on each finger don't line up with the segments on the others.

**Finger Segments**

The first section of the finger, starting at the knuckle, is the longest of the three finger parts. The second section, in the middle, is shorter than this, but longer than the third section, the fingertip.

**Segment Alignment**

As none of the fingers are of equal length, none of these divisions line up across the finger mass. However, these segments — the longer section from the knuckle to the next longest to the shortest — are still the structure of every finger.

**Finger Construction**

Each section of each finger is always straight, never curved. Even when you see the most graceful willowy hand movements, the fingers may curve, but each segment (called a _phalange_ ) is straight. Draw these finger sections with straight lines on the top side, and with rounded fatty pads on the lower, the palm side. Think of each segment as a cylinder and you will get the perspective right.

**Palm Up**

We have been studying the back of the hand. Now turn the hand over, palm up.

**Equal Parts**

Looking at the fingers, you can see there are three parts to each finger — three fleshy pads, all quite equal on any one finger. Of course, since the fingers are not all the same length, the pads and the folds between them do not line up with each other across the hand.

You'd think the folds on each finger would match the joint divisions on the back of the finger, wouldn't you? Study your own hand carefully.

**Surprise Fold**

There is a fold at the third joint, the fingertip joint, a second fold at the second joint, and a third fold at the first joint. On the palm side, this is where the fingers end and the palm begins. Now fold your hand at the knuckles — you are in for a surprise — the fingers do not fold at this third joint where they join the hand; the knuckle joint on the back corresponds with a fourth fold across the palm of the hand! This is where the finger action starts!

**Study the Hand to Draw It More Naturally**

Look at your hand from the side to prove that the third fold on the inside is only halfway between the second joint and the knuckle joint on the back. Curl your fingers halfway closed and see this amazing fact for yourself, first from the thumb side, then from the little-finger side. There is no movement where the fingers appear to attach to the hand, but at the knuckles further down in the hand mass. Knowing this will help you to draw hands in natural positions.

###  _Finishing the Hand_

**The Cupped Hand**

The hand is naturally cupped when in repose. Cupped from fingertips to heel, the hand is also cupped from side to side. Knowing this will help remind you to round the form across the knuckles in any view.

The only time the hand is flat is when a conscious effort is made to extend the fingers.

**The Thumb**

The thumb may be considered a long form with squared sides. It has three joints; the base joint is out of sight in the hand and connected to the wrist.

The fingers and the thumb fan out from the wrist. However, the visible joint where the thumb joins the hand is nowhere near the finger joints and is never in a line with them unless the hand is tightly closed, as when making a fist. The thumb dominates the hand, particularly when the hand is holding on to something.

The thumb appears most often at right angles to the fingers. You can check this easily: when you look at your hand palm down and see the fingernails in full view, you see the thumbnail in profile. Conversely, when looking at the thumbnail full view, you'll see that the fingernails are in profile.

**The Nails**

Adding the fingernails helps considerably in conveying the form and direction of the fingers and hands. The nail starts halfway down the fingertip segment of each finger and thumb. On a man's hand, keep the nails quite square; on a woman's hand, make them oval and a bit longer. Most portrait painters idealize the hands by making the fingers longer, and the fingernails in a woman's portrait look better if they are colored a soft pink or coral. Adding the highlight on the shine of the nails makes them almost like jewelry on a man or a woman. And on a small child, shiny nails make the tiny hands look very clean.

**Drawing and Painting Hands**

As for color, the fingertips are always a warmer hue than the rest of the flesh. In fact, all the extremities — hands, feet, ears and nose — are warmer, that is, pinker or rosier.

A child's hands are fatter, rounder, less defined, less "controlled" than an adult's. Although the forms of their fingers appear to be round, you will have greater success if you describe them with straight lines.

If you are right-handed, practice drawing your left hand in various positions, e.g., palm up, palm down, clenched, pointing, holding a letter or a flower. If you are left-handed, draw your right hand. The sketches in this section will give you some ideas.

In general, it's safe to say you should try to block in any form with straight lines. Your work will be stronger and more solid. It's a simple matter to round off any area in the finishing — the start is what counts!

**Summing Up**

By now you're probably thinking, "How am I going to remember all that?" No one expects you to remember it. I only hope one day when you're in the middle of a portrait and having trouble with the hands (all of us do, you know), you'll look back at this chapter and find the answer to the problem that's plaguing you. Most often the problem is in the basic construction and not the details. I can't stress this too strongly. I could give you the clearest, sharpest photograph of hands in the world, and you could spend days and weeks painting from it, but without real knowledge of how the hand is constructed and how it works, your painting will be lifeless and without substance. Remember, artists don't paint only what they see; they paint what they know!

Out of Perspective

Draw What You Know

Good Proportions

Thumb Too Long and Skinny

Thumb Too Big

"Bunch of Bananas" Syndrome

**Common Errors**

  * **Hands too large or too small; out of proportion.** The length of the hand from its heel to the tip of the longest finger is considered to be the length of the face, from chin to hairline.

  * **The "bunch of bananas" syndrome.** Fingers appear to be hanging off a block-like form (which is the hand) rather than growing out from the knuckles.

  * **Too much definition.** Draw the separate cylinders of the fingers, but when finishing, eliminate many of these lines and treat the fingers as masses with less articulation.

  * **Out of perspective.** Be conscious of your viewing position, and try to draw the finger cylinders in proper perspective.

  * **Awkwardly drawn wrist.** You can learn to draw every part of the human body in any position from memory — except the wrist. Keep it as a flat block and it will give you less trouble.

###  _The Legs_

You won't often be asked to include legs and feet in a portrait of an adult, but if you decide to make portrait painting a career, one day you will most certainly be commissioned to paint a full-length portrait of your client. Even if a man's legs are covered by trousers or a woman's by a lovely gown, you still need to know what the body is doing underneath all that fabric. Also, to paint the standing figure you have to know how the weight of the body is supported.

The thigh — the form from hip to knee — is all one bone, the _femur_. The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the body. The femur is attached by a necklike form to the pelvis in a ball and socket formation. This allows the leg to move freely forward, backward, sideways, up and down.

As the thigh descends to the knee, it centers itself under the central weight of the torso. The knee is in a direct line with the hip joint.

The leg from knee to ankle, like the forearm from elbow to wrist, is made up of two bones side by side. The heavier bone is the _tibia_ , and the narrower bone is the _fibula_. The fibula allows the ankle to rotate, although we cannot flop our foot over 180 degrees as we can our hand.

Seen from the front, the inner ankle bone is obviously higher than the outer protuberance.

**Front**

**Back**

**Inner Side**

**Drawing the Leg**

The leg in profile presents an elongated S-curve. The kneecap (the _patella_ ) is held in place by extremely strong ligaments attached to the fibula below the shinbone. The leg resembles two cylinders of equal length, one from the upper thigh to the kneecap, and one from the kneecap to the inner ankle bone.

When a figure is seated with the legs bent at the hip and knee, drawing the thighs is much easier if you think of them as cylinders in perspective and proceed as suggested in these drawings.

###  _The Feet_

The foot is a wedge shape that flattens out at the toes. When a subject is standing, the outside of the foot, from the little toe to the heel, is usually flat on the ground. The main arch of the foot is on the inside, normally raised from the ground. This gives spring to the foot as it steps.

Notice that the big toe is often separated from the other four toes, rather like the thumb is separated from the other fingers.

When drawing the foot, try blocking it in with straight lines for strength and support. And block in the toes as small cylindrical forms. Learning to draw the toenails properly will help put the foot in perspective. This is important since all views from the front present the foot in perspective.

**Children's Legs and Feet**

Though you may seldom be called upon to include legs in an adult's portrait, if you paint children you will have many opportunities to depict their little legs. The construction of a child's leg and foot is the same as the adult's, but there is less definition of muscle and the forms are more rounded.

An infant's foot is round, not flat, on the sole, as he has not worn shoes or walked enough to flatten the soles. The feet are fatter than those of an adult and the toes can be very tiny. Again, the small toenails help to establish the angle of the foot.

Many times you will prefer to paint a small child barefoot, even in fairly dressy clothing. The bare feet take away the over-formal look and remind us that the child is more free and natural than adults.

**Child's Legs**

**Child's Feet**

**After Mary Cassatt**

**Common Errors**

  * **Foot not strong enough or large enough to support the body.**

  * **Proportions of the foot are off.** Feet with toes can look like paws if you're not careful.

  * **Not rounded, lacking form.** If you're having trouble with the bare feet in a portrait, paint sandals on them — the sandals will help describe the foot.

  * **Poorly placed in relation to the rest of the body.** Sometimes you'll see a portrait of a woman in a long dress that looks as if the painter just stuck the feet on anywhere at the edge of the dress, with no thought of any follow-through from hip to thigh to knee to ankle to foot. Don't let this happen to you. Try to draw the limbs beneath the clothing so the feet will come from the legs. You have to use your knowledge and your imagination and search for key points — especially the knees — beneath the fabric. Make it a rule for yourself: Always construct the body inside the clothing first.

###  _Proportions of the Body_

**Adults**

Using the head-length as a unit of mea-surement, the adult human figure is 7 to 8 heads high. The idealized figure is 8 heads high, lending a feeling of dignity and elegance. (Never make the head larger than it appears; this makes the figure look clumsy.) A good size for the average figure is 7½ heads.

In this illustration, the male and female figures are 7½ to 8 heads high. From the top of the head to the hip line measures 4 heads, and from this line to the heel measures 3½ heads. Study the diagram to see which parts of the figure can definitely be located by the head unit of measurement. Of course, the first head-length is the head; the second is the distance from the chin to the nipples; the third to just above the navel but below the waist; the fourth head-length takes us to the hip line. From this line it is 1½ heads to the knees. The center of the figure is about at the fourth head line, or just above that line.

In the male adult, the shoulders are approximately 2 head-lengths wide; this is the widest part of the male body. In the female body, the hips are often as wide as the shoulders.

When the arm hangs at the side, the elbow touches the rim of the hip bone, the _iliac crest_ , and the inside of the wrist is on a level with the halfway point of the figure. The fingers reach a little below the center of the thigh.

**Children**

In children the head is larger in proportion to the body. The central figure in the diagram, the one-year-old, has a head one-quarter the length of the body. The central point, indicated by the dotted line, is at the waist; above the navel may be easier to determine, as an infant this age normally has no waist.

The four-year-old (second from left) has a head-length approximately 20 percent of the body length, which therefore, is 5 heads high. The central point is 2½ head-lengths from the top of the head.

The eight-year-old child (fourth figure from the left) is about 6 heads high, and the halfway point is moving down nearly to the adult halfway point, the hip line. (The three children are in proportion to each other but not to the adult figures in the drawing. In actuality, their heads are smaller than adult heads, but drawing them in these sizes makes the proportions easier to see and to remember.)

**Drawing From Life**

You can look at these diagrams and study your own body, but there's no substitute for drawing from the live model. If you can't find a life drawing class in your area, start one. Perhaps you can get members of your family or a classmate or friend to pose resting, reading, or even watching television! Portrait painting is really only an off-shoot of life drawing — sort of life drawing with personality superimposed.

Some students are interested in anatomy, the study of the skeleton and the muscles. Others don't have the slightest desire to know what goes on under the skin. But as a portrait artist, you need to know something about anatomy. If you want to study it in more detail, some excellent texts on anatomy for artists are available. Anatomy for medical students is a much more definitive study, but you don't have to master it in this great a depth. Even if you keep just this book near you while you are observing and drawing the live figure, you will see real progress in only ten drawing sessions.

Practice drawing people in a variety of positions. Most artists continue to draw from the figure throughout their lifetimes. To draw the figure well — to re-create its mass and its movement — is a highly desirable skill. And there isn't an artist alive who ever feels he draws the figure as well as he should.

**Put Theory Into Practice**

After deciding on a pose for your subject, get into the habit of measuring by head-length. Extend your arm, hold your brush vertically, and measure along the handle of the brush. Then measure the second, third and fourth head-lengths to get a rough idea of just how much of the figure can be included on your canvas or paper.

**Start With the Large Forms**

To get the proportions right, it makes sense to draw the large forms first, and then begin constructing the masses by means of light and shade and defining the larger planes. As you continue to work, the portrait will gradually get more and more refined, until eventually you arrive at the likeness and individuality of your sitter. I know an experienced portrait painter who can begin with one eye and build the whole head and body around it, but don't make it this difficult for yourself yet! As a student, always draw the figure as a whole before you put in the details of the head, hand, foot or face.

###  _Weight Distribution_

We have learned to block in the figure with jointed cylinders for arms and legs, a thoracic egg and a pelvic block for the torso, a mitten for the hand, and a wedge for the foot. However, there's more to it than that. We must also consider shoulder and hip construction lines from the very beginning of our sketch, for these lines tell us instantly how the figure is standing and how the body's weight is distributed.

**Using Construction Lines**

The following construction lines are particularly helpful: the shoulder line ( _A_ ) passes from one shoulder to the other through the neck and is paired with a second line ( _AA_ ) under the rib cage, which always parallels it. The line at the hip ( _B_ ) is paired with a second line ( _BB_ ) through the tops of the iliac crests of the pelvis; these two also always parallel each other.

Only when the body is seen standing perfectly erect with the weight distributed equally between both feet, are all the shoulder and hip construction lines parallel to each other.

**Weight on Right Leg**

When the weight is shifted to one foot, say the left, as shown in this female fig-ure, both the shoulder line and the hip line bend toward each other. The right nonbearing leg appears to be longer than the left supporting leg. The nonbearing leg can be bent, or extended to front, back or side — it doesn't matter, for it isn't being used to hold the body upright, but just to balance its weight. Just watching for this shoulder-hip relationship will help your figure drawing look more natural.

Looking in a mirror, try it yourself. Stand with your weight on your right leg and raise your right shoulder. Uncomfortable! As you lower your right shoulder and raise the left, your body stands relaxed.

**The Plumb Line**

When a subject stands with the weight on one foot, the inside of the ankle supporting the weight is in a direct line straight down from the pit of the neck. This holds true whether the body is viewed from the front, back or side. This very important line is called the _plumb line_.

When drawing a figure from life, tie the end of a string about 24 inches (61cm) long around a small stone about 2 inches (5cm) in size. Holding the string up, the weight of the stone will give you a completely straight vertical line. This method was used long ago in the French Academy life drawing classes.

**Weight on Left Leg**

###  _Looking for the Plumb Line_

Try drawing ten figures like these incorporating these ideas for blocking in and your knowledge of the plumb line. Just six inches (15cm) high is enough to demonstrate the principle. Look at figures in magazines or at people around you for poses.

Incidentally, you will know when you are drawing these shoulder and hip construction lines incorrectly. If both pairs are slanted in the same direction the figure looks as if it were about to fall over!

The sketch figures here are constructed to emphasize that flexibility in the torso exists only in the area between the shoulder-rib cage mass and the pelvic mass, which are simplified here to squared straight-line forms. The principle of the plumb line from the pit of the neck to the inside of weight-bearing ankle holds true no matter which view of the figure is portrayed: back, front or side. The center back and center front lines are lightly indicated on these figures to show that they are independent of the plumb line.

If you practice sketching small figures like these for fifteen minutes three times a week, soon you'll be able to sketch people anywhere — in a bus station, at a party, at the beach — wherever people are standing about, waiting or conversing. You will be able to sketch convincing figures from your imagination as well. Then, when you have a new portrait client, you can do several quick sketches suggesting possible poses as a logical first step in the development of the portrait. Remember, you gain confidence as you gain facility.

**Centered Weight**

When the figure stands straight with the shoulder line and hip line level and weight distributed equally on both feet, the plumb line from the pit of the neck drops to a point centered between the feet.

**Half-Seated — No Plumb Line**

If the figure is half-seated on the edge of a desk, left shoulder lowered, left hip raised, the plumb line doesn't apply because the body weight rests on the pelvis, not the feet.

**Weight on the Left Leg**

When the figure is standing (seen from the back) with weight on the left leg and foot, the plumb line runs from the pit of the neck in front to inside the left ankle. The left shoulder is dropped and left hip raised.

**Weight on the Right Leg**

When the standing figure is slightly turned, with weight on the right leg and foot, the plumb line falls from the pit of the neck to inside the right ankle. The right shoulder is dropped, the right hip raised.

##  _Drapery:_   
Clothing the Figure

**Mallory**

Oil on canvas 48″ × 38″ (122cm × 97cm)

**Y** our rendition of clothing is a powerful tool for designing a portrait beautifully. It can add a great deal to the feeling of reality you wish to achieve.

Clothing is just fabric lying flat until someone puts it on the body. For all of us, our clothing means excess fabric, enough so we can move — bend, sit, crouch, walk. Since you will be painting many types of fabric, it's important to understand the individual characteristics of each one.

There are thin, fine, clinging fabrics like chiffon, which is sheer enough to reveal the forms within; silk; and satin, which is also shiny. There are medium-weight fabrics like cotton, taffeta, knits and woolens. There are heavy woolens for coats; velvets that absorb light to the extent they show no highlight but rather a rim light on the edges of the forms; and fur, another pile material that can be flat and glossy like broadtail or long-haired like lynx. The list goes on and on.

###  _Observing Folds in Fabric_

It's important to really notice the fabric in the clothing of people you see around you and study the differences. Mannequins in store windows and photographs in fashion and sports magazines are also good sources for study.

The weight and texture of the fabric controls the manner in which it drapes, wrinkles or folds. The condition of the fabric — whether it is wet or dry, old or new, rumpled or pressed — also affects its appearance. Even though each fabric performs differently, we'll develop a method so that you can begin to understand what's occurring when you see a sleeve on the arm you are painting, or a scarf around that neck, for all fabrics make the same kinds of folds.

**Fabric Lying on a Form**

Lying-on folds are just that — the fabric follows the form it's lying on. Spread out on a table, fabric looks flat. On a cylinder, or an arm or a leg, it hangs, but not quite straight down because it follows the form a bit before falling. Always look first for the areas of fabric that touch the form beneath.

**Fabric Going Around a Form**

Look for instances where fabric appears to go behind a form and come out on the other side, such as a collar does around a neck. As we know from our anatomy work, the back of the neck is flatter and higher than the front of the neck, which is rounder and lower. This makes the front of a garment appear to dip down at the neckline in a round manner while the back of the collar or neckline lies higher and flatter.

You could think of the folds on a cylindrical form — such as the arm, leg or torso — as curtain rod rings around a rod. These folds are drawn mostly with curving lines. Just remember that without the rod, the rings would be lying in a heap, and without the arm the sleeve would be a floppy tube of fabric. Draw the arm first, with its gesture and movement; then lay the folds over the form like curtain rod rings.

###  _Hanging and Pulling Fabric_

**Fabric Hanging**

Hanging folds are affected by gravity and the weight of the fabric. Draw these folds mostly with straight lines.

To study the way fabric hangs, get a piece of soft white cotton or cottonblend fabric the weight of sheeting, about 48-inches (122cm) square, and some pushpins, tacks or tape.

**Slight Drape**

Put the pins through the cloth at the two top corners and attach the fabric to the wall surface. As you move each pushpin with the fabric closer together, you'll see the fabric begin to drape a bit.

**Swag Folds**

Leaving the pins at the corners of the fabric, move each top corner about 4 inches (10cm) closer to the other, keeping the pins at the same height. You'll see the fabric now drapes into swag folds because the weight of the material is being pulled by gravity into triangular forms. Try to see the folds as forms with a halftone side, a light plane which is the top plane, and a shadow side. Use a spotlight if necessary.

**Pipe Folds**

Hang the fabric now using just one pushpin somewhere along the top edge of the fabric, but not at the corner. You will see there are no more swag folds, only pipe folds and excess fabric hanging as a _jabot_ — a cascade of frills down the front of a shirt — might.

**Swag Folds and Pipe Folds**

Keeping the pushpins at the two top corners of the fabric, move one now to a spot on the wall about 8 inches (20cm) lower than the other. The folds are now off-center, and you are getting swag folds and hanging folds. Notice that the swag fold shadows are composed of broad triangular forms, while the hanging folds are more like "pipes" (organ pipes, that is).

**For Further Practice**

In all of these swag and hanging folds, the lines radiate from a hub, a point of suspension — in this case, the pushpin. Flip one corner of the excess cloth to the front to overlap the rest and observe what happens.

**Fabric Pulling**

Pulling folds are action folds and are usually drawn in curved lines. See the seated trouser drawings here for examples of pulling folds.

**Fabric Hanging From the Waist**

When drawing a skirt that's either gathered or pleated, the largest folds are at the center of the body; they become smaller toward the sides. The folds are in perspective.

**Seated Trousers — Pulling Folds**

In these drawings of seated trousers you can see the outside fabric stretches taut over the knee. The lines radiate from the smooth ball of the knee. The inside bunches at the front where the stomach meets the upper thigh, and again at the back of the knee. The fabric is stretched smooth over the buttocks. There are hanging folds below the knee where the fabric hangs free, and there's a lying-on fold where the trouser fabric hits the shoe.

**Variety of Folds and Gatherings**

In this standing trouser drawing, you see gathered fabric puckering from the elastic waistband; puckered folds at the crotch; fabric pulled taut over the right knee, and bunched inside the knee bend; hanging folds where the trouser fabric hangs free from the left hip; and lying-on folds where the fabric of the right trouser leg follows the calf of that leg.

**Straight Pleats and Gathers**

In the drawing of the woman's skirt, the fabric is soft — maybe a silk crepe. The pleats and gathers fall very straight down from the hips and stay close to the body beneath.

**Stiff Gathering and Ruffles**

In the child's skirt the fabric is more crisp and has more body — perhaps it's a cotton. The gathering of the skirt at the waistband pushes the stiffer fabric out and away from the body. In this drawing you also see one way of handling another fuller ruffle of fabric. Note the small ruffle trim applied to the skirt as well.

###  _Exercise_

Drawing Drapery

This drapery study is helpful at any stage of your development. A knowledge of drapery is essential for portrait painters so that they can paint the clothing of sitters convincingly and design portraits with drama and conviction. You will also use this knowledge when depicting background drapery such as a cloth over a table or a curtain at a window.

1 Spread out a 48-inch (122cm) square of white cotton fabric flat on a table or the floor. You need a yardstick and two markers with wide nibs, one colored and one black. With the colored marker make three parallel lines across the fabric dividing it equally into four parts. Make one line solid, one line of dashes and one of dots. Turn the fabric in the other direction and do the same with the black marker.

2 You need a middle-value toned paper large enough to make nearly life-size drawings of the fabric arrangements. The brown wrapping paper sold on 36-inch (91cm) rolls has a pleasant tooth and will do the job well. You also need soft and medium soft charcoal for the shadows, and white chalk or white pastel for the highlights. The brown tone of the paper will serve as the halftone. You need a board large enough to support the paper, at least 30″ × 40″ (76cm × 102cm), and an easel, or you can tape the paper directly to a wall.

Try making at least one study of each of the four hanging fold arrangements from the beginning of this section. The lines you've drawn on the cloth will help you perceive what the fabric is actually doing. Every fold has a minimum of three surfaces (i.e., the top plane, the left side plane and the right side plane). These planes will be easier to see if a single light source is used, such as light from a window on one side of the room or a spotlight.

Keep your drawings simple. It's easy to get "lost in the folds" when your rendering becomes too intricate. If you begin to feel confused, get away from the work for a few minutes, or check in your mirror, observing the draped fabric and your drawing at the same time. Spray your drawings with fixative when you're finished so they won't smear.

###  _Painting Drapery Without the Sitter_

Although it would be best if we could always paint our subjects from life, it isn't always possible. Here are some ways to capture drapery accurately without your sitter.

**The Stand-In**

When Queen Elizabeth has her portrait painted, which is frequently, she must of necessity have another person pose in her place while the artist paints the clothing and the jewelry. This is an excellent method for getting the job done when a very busy person is your subject.

**The Lay Figure**

Many portrait painters borrow the clothing from the subject and drape it on a _lay figure_ — a life-size mannequin or a dressmaker's dummy — as a substitute for the real person. This not only relieves the client from all that posing, but the lay figure doesn't move, so the folds (and the light on them) are always the same.

Most lay figures in artists' studios are department store display mannequins and can be arranged to sit or to stand. Some even come with two sets of arms to allow more variety in the poses.

My own work is usually done from life in the home of the client. But to save my subject many hours of posing while I work on the clothing, I stuff the garment with a bed pillow and smaller pillows for the torso; when necessary I also use rolled towels inside the sleeves for arms. I then prop up my "figure" on the same chair as in the portrait and can work as long as I like on the folds and the pattern of the fabric.

**Interpreting Drapery**

The Greek and Roman artists sculpted drapery as if it were wet fabric, in very vertical pipelike forms. In the works of Albrecht Dürer and other artists of the Middle Ages, the fabric appears crisp, and the folds are squarish and angular.

Peter Paul Rubens painted drapery in large round forms and influenced the Baroque painters. Two of the best to study for drapery are the eighteenth-century artists Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Antoine Watteau. The seventeenth-century sculptor and painter Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini made marble look like the airiest of fabrics billowing on the wind.

**After Lorenzo di Credi**

In this drawing after Lorenzo di Credi, a Renaissance artist who worked with Leonardo da Vinci, the figure appears to be nearly flying in the wind. The motion and emotion in this tiny study are created solely by the handling of the drapery. We know the drawing is fantasy from the artist's knowledge and imagination, for no one could ever see fabric moving this rapidly, let alone draw it. But the illusion is complete. Try a portrait one day of a figure outdoors, hair and scarf blowing in the wind.

##  _Lighting_ for Portraits

**Shayna**

Watercolor on 140-lb. (300gsm) cold press 30″ × 22″ (76cm × 56cm)

**T** he way you pose your sitter in relation to the light source has a great bearing on the look of the finished portrait. When posing your model, lighting is the first think to consider. I almost always use natural daylight or daylight supplemented by artificial light. I personally find it impossible to paint flesh tones at night when the only source of light must be artificial, though that doesn't mean all artists find this so. Artificial light is fine for charcoal portraits, where color is not involved.

Before you begin to paint or draw, try having your sitter pose with several different lighting arrangements and in different positions. Usually one place and one pose will prove to be so obviously more interesting or beautiful than the others that you can hardly wait to paint it.

In this chapter you'll find examples of various poses of the heads. Then try to simulate these poses and lighting conditions on your own, with a model, and make light and shadow sketches of each of these. You will learn a lot from this. And here's your chance to draw forty-four more heads!

###  _Lighting the Front View_

For this lesson you'll need someone to pose for you. Your drawing materials include paper, a soft pencil (perhaps a 6B), a kneaded eraser, and some sort of portable spotlight such as a clampon type or a photographer's light and stand, or even a table or floor lamp with the shade removed. A 200-watt light should be sufficient. Draw your model in the kinds of light discussed here. She should be looking straight at you.

A word of caution: When using artificial light as a supplementary source of light, be extremely careful not to get "crossed" lights — that is, one light coming from the left and another of the same brilliance from the right. Working in this situation will end in complete frustration. Remember, one source of light must dominate. Make sure the second light is not as bright as the primary illumination.

**Rembrandt Lighting**

The lamp is at about ten o'clock, slightly to the front. A triangle of light appears on the cheek away from the light source. This type of lighting describes form very well.

**Overhead Lighting**

This makes large dark holes for eyes and is most unflattering. Often on overhead skylight creates this effect. Very satisfactory, if you like a spooky effect!

**Sidelight**

One side of the head is in the light, the other side is in shadow. Highly dramatic, but unsuitable for natural-looking portraits.

**Backlight**

This creates a silhouette — it's what happens when the model is in front of a window. Backlight could be interesting to use if some light were reflected back into the face with a mirror or a piece of white cardboard.

**Three-Quarter Backlight**

This rim light effect is interesting for unusual faces, but too harsh for some. It's not for conventional portraiture.

**Bottom Light**

This lighting turns any face into a fearsome one — you really have to see it to believe it. Try it on yourself with a lamp or a flashlight.

**Front Light**

Since it's nearly shadowless, frontal light is excellent for people over age thirty-five. The features are clearly described, but none of the aging characteristics are emphasized. It's also good for children, since it's best to aim for natural effects rather than theatrical ones when painting them. The eyes show very well in this light, as does soft, delicate modeling. If you stand with your back to a window, both the sitter and your canvas will be bathed in this frontal light, a good arrangement.

###  _Lighting the Profile_

The profile view seems to give an impression of being not very personal, as the sitter is looking away from us. I don't think I have ever been asked to do a profile portrait. Perhaps the best way would be to paint the sitter as if she were out of doors in open shade with a natural background of trees, flowers or sky between ten o'clock and two o'clock, giving a more decorative painting.

**Top Front Lighting**

Positioning the light at the front of the face and slightly from above, at about ten o'clock, is a good angle here.

**Rim Light**

This general, overall light coming from the front makes for an interesting profile portrait. Moving the light source away from the face creates a softer effect.

**Back Rim Light**

This really describes good features. Unusual.

**Totally Frontal Light**

This light isn't very satisfactory for a profile portrait. The portrait always appears somewhat flat, as it shows only half the face and one eye. Frontal lighting flattens out all the forms even more.

**Bottom Light**

Scrooge and evil spirits once more!

###  _Lighting the Three-Quarter View_

The three-quarter view is the most natural view for a portrait in any medium. Visit your local library and study the work of American artists John Singer Sargent, Gilbert Stuart and James McNeill Whistler (who took sixty sittings to finish a portrait!). Also look at the British artists Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Thomas Lawrence, the Italian artist Botticelli, the Dutch painters Rem-brandt, Vermeer and Van Gogh, and the Spaniard, Joaquín Sorolla. Take the time to study how each artist lit his portrait subjects, and you will learn from each of these artists.

**Rembrandt Lighting**

Creating a triangle of light on the cheek of the shadow side of the face is the most dramatic and most definitive of all lighting. Here are three versions of this time-honored lighting for portraiture.

**Close to the Light Source**

With the model seated close to the light source we get a very intense light — too intense for most portrait clients but really exciting for the painter because of the distinct lines of demarcation between light and shadow areas. This lighting is excellent for the study of solid form.

**Medium Distance From the Light Source**

Here the model is seated a bit farther away from the light source. We get a softer light, with less contrast, but still quite good definition.

**Far From the Light Source**

The model is even farther from the light source here, giving us a very soft, quite diffuse light. More flattering for the portrait client, more difficult for the painter because of such subtle definition of forms.

**Frontal Light**

This light diminishes all shadows; therefore, it is most flattering for women, and in fact for anyone past middle age. It's good for children as well, particularly since I feel that children's faces are best painted without heavy shadow areas.

**Rim Light**

This light is good used as an accent light with the general overall light coming from the front. It is often seen when the subject is near a window on a bright day.

**Sidelight**

Sidelight from a window works well in a three-quarter portrait and is probably what you will use most frequently.

**Sidelight, Face Turned Into the Light**

This lighting in a portrait looks very natural. The nose and cheekbones are well defined by midvalue shadows. Notice the highlight is on the brow bone nearest us, also on her left cheek near the nose, as well as on the nose and the lower lip. Notice the cast shadow in the background. Some artists use this to good advantage. Of course, it is seen only when the backdrop is close to the head.

**Sidelight, Face Half Turned Into Shadow**

As the face turns into the shadow, naturalness is replaced by drama. Look how the right eye attracts us, while the left eye is lost in the shadow side. This lighting is not for everyone, but would be great fun to try in a portrait of yourself. (Usually clients like to see both eyes!)

###  _Lighting the Three-Quarter Back View_

The only way to illuminate the face in this pose is with a sidelight, with the brightest light striking the features and defining them. This is a favorite view of Andrew Wyeth's. A portrait done from this angle always gives one the feeling that it is totally natural and un-posed. It also conveys a feeling of great privacy for the sitter, for the viewer is not even considered — the sitter is lost in her own vision, her own thoughts.

**A Final Word**

After you've been working for some time, make a conscious effort to vary the lighting schemes in your portraits. Some painters use the same light direction in all their work, and this sameness has a tendency to make all the portraits look alike.

If you want the person to appear as if he were outdoors, try using a diffuse light. There are two ways to diffuse the light. It can be placed farther away from the subject, or a diffusing shield can be placed over the spotlight. In nature, the light comes from the sky, but it is reflected in a hundred ways; it is a flattering light for people of any age. Almost all portraits with outdoor backgrounds and light were actually painted indoors. Try painting your subject in the open air just one time and you'll know why. The flickering of light through leaves constantly moving in the breeze, the lights and shadows on the face changing every half hour as the sun moves across the sky — all this makes your job extremely frustrating.

Direct sunlight throws sharply defined lights and shadows on the face and also forces the sitter to squint. Brilliant sun is hard on the sitter and hard on the painter. However, if you decide you absolutely must try it — and you should — be sure to keep the sun off your canvas or paper when you are painting. It's impossible to judge the true color of things when the canvas is reflecting sunlight back into your eyes. The same rule applies to landscape painting. However, you must realize the more landscapes you paint outdoors, the more convincing the "outdoor daylight" in your indoor portraits will be.

**Sidelight**

This looks as if the model were seated beside a window, looking out.

**Top Light**

Since the face is in shadow, you need to use a light background with this kind of lighting. This view in this light gives the ultimate in subtlety and mystery to a portrait.

**Backlight**

Some light here is also reflected into the face. This is what happens when the model is in front of a window, an interesting effect but tricky for the artist who must look against the light.

##  _Working_   
in Charcoal

**Anne**

Charcoal on gray paper 20″ × 16″ (51cm × 41cm) Collection of the artist

**I** recommend charcoal for your first portraits with a live model. They are simpler to do than a portrait in color, because you're working only with value (light and dark) and line. On the other hand, there's no color to "pretty up" the finished portrait, so your knowledge is visible for all to see. Above all, please don't dismiss charcoal as a trivial medium. It has been the sketch and study medium since prehistoric man drew his animals on the walls of the Altamira caves.

###  _Values for Charcoal Portraits_

It is obvious that charcoal drawings have no color; they are in black and white and many variations of gray. For portrait painters, these variations from white, through the grays, to black, are organized into a system of _values_.

Some artists paint with a system of five values, some with nine values. Here we use a simplified system of seven values. White and black are not really used except as accents. Therefore we are working in a narrow range of five values: light, mid-light, mid-tone or medium, mid-dark and dark. Compare your work to the value chart. Squint your eyes and look through your eyelashes at both the chart and your work. It's much easier to determine value relationships with your eyes half closed.

**Bands of Value Across the Head**

The rule of thumb when painting a head, whether in black and white or in color, is to have _three values in the light and one value in the shadow_. If the light is high and from the upper left, the lightest value — where the light is most intense — is the band across the forehead. The second lightest is the band across the cheeks, nose and ear. Third lightest is the band across the chin and jaw. All these values are in the light.

**Light and Shadow on the Head**

We would use values 2, 3 and 4 for the light on the head of a person with a light or fair complexion. Someone with a medium-toned complexion would still have three values in the light but all three would be pitched a bit lower. As the complexion becomes darker, however, the values become closer together; a very dark-skinned person may have only two values in the light areas of the face. The shadow on a fair person would be value 5½. The shadow on the face of a medium-toned and a dark complexioned person would be value 6 — dark, never value 7 — black.

**Highlights on the Head**

The highlight on any area of the face is half a value lighter than the general value of that area. This means the highlight on the chin can never be as light as the highlight on the forehead.

The highlight on any area of flesh is never pure white. Pure black (or colors mixed to the value of black) is used only as accents. No shadow on any head is ever the black value, no matter how dark the complexion.

For changes in small forms such as eyelids, noses and mouths, the top planes in the light are half a value lighter in light areas and half a value darker in shadow areas.

###  _Setting Up for Work With a Live Model_

These are ideal working conditions and won't always be easy to arrange, but it's worth a try. If you're comfortable, the portrait will have a better chance of success, no matter what medium you're working in — charcoal, oil or watercolor.

You should work standing. Do whatever you can to get the sitter's head up or down to your eye level. You could seat the model on a high stool or on a chair on a model stand. A model stand is a platform about 15 inches (38cm) high and at least 5 feet (1.5m) square to allow room for the chair and a screen or backdrop.

**Background**

The backdrop helps eliminate distracting and confusing shapes and colors behind the model. Later in your career, you'll choose a particular color, texture and pattern to enhance your sitter's coloring and costume, but for now use a plain, light-colored fabric in a neutral shade draped over a folding screen or taped to the wall.

**Lighting**

If you are working in a room with good daylight, move the model until you get the light you want on the face. If there's only artificial light, you may need lamps or a spotlight. Place the easel next to the model, as close as possible. The light should be the same on the model's head as on the work on the easel. Make sure the model doesn't cast a shadow on the portrait, and that the painting doesn't cast its shadow on the model.

**The "Looking Spot"**

Mark a line on the floor about 6 feet (1.8m) in front of the easel with masking tape. You will look at the model only from this spot, never when you are up at the easel. Squint so you see only the larger forms, no details, and make your decisions about what to do next at this distance — then step up to the easel and paint. Working this way, you'll get far less distortion in your portrait. In a class situation, step back a few feet, turn around, and check the painting often in a hand mirror. As a drawing aid, the mirror is very helpful, because it doubles the distance between you and your work and also reverses the drawing, giving you a new look at it. Leonardo da Vinci wrote, "You should take a flat mirror and look at your work in it... and you will be better able to judge its errors than in any other way." Set your drawing or painting materials out on a table or taboret back at your looking spot, on your right or left, whatever side is most comfortable for you.

**Timing the Pose**

Let the model rest for five minutes after every twenty or twenty-five minutes of posing. You need the break, too, to move around and look at your work from a different perspective. Set a kitchen timer and place it so that the model can see it — then you need not watch the clock. A word of advice: don't try to develop the portrait head when the model isn't posing; this can lead to disaster!

**Understanding the "Looking Spot"**

Here we see the artist standing 6 feet (1.8m) back from the easel at the "looking spot." The model is seated on a high stool so that her head is on the eye-level of the artist. The paper or canvas is on the easel, and the crossbar of the easel is adjusted so that it is supporting the painting surface at the same height as the model's head. Having the paper or canvas at the same level as the head of the model allows the artist to visualize the head on that surface. The easel is placed just next to the model and on the same plane, meaning not in front of the model nor behind the model.

You will walk back and forth from the "looking spot" to the easel many times in the course of the portrait drawing or painting.

###  _Demonstration_

Charcoal on White Paper

Tape or clip the charcoal paper to the board. You will have better results with two extra sheets of paper to act as a pad underneath the working sheet. Break off a 2-inch (5cm) piece of soft charcoal, and, holding it on its side, cover the entire sheet with long broad strokes. Then smooth the charcoal with your fingers so the whole sheet has a middle tone (about value 4). Rub it in enough so it won't disappear when you blow off the excess charcoal dust. It need not be an even gray, just not too streaky. Indeed, some tonal variety adds to the interest. If the overall tone is too dark, the lines of your drawing won't show clearly and your work will look messy. Wash your hands before proceeding.

Set up for work as described earlier, and set the timer for twenty-five minutes. Pose the model looking straight at you, full face, head not tilted. Have the light at the upper left front, similar to Rembrandt lighting.

**Blocking In the Head**

Adjust the easel so the center of the paper is the same height as the model's head. Step back to your looking spot and try to visualize the head on the paper. Then walk up to your paper and make a mark for the top and bottom of the head. Hold the charcoal loosely at the end, not tightly like a pencil. Draw with your whole arm, swinging from the shoulder, holding the charcoal at arm's length. This will prevent your work from getting too tight too soon. Try to work life-size: 8 inches (20cm) for an adult female head and 9 inches (23cm) for an adult male head.

Lightly and quickly, draw the oval of the head, then the neck cylinder. Lightly put in the horizontal eye line midway down, then the vertical center line. Add the brow line and place the nose approximately halfway between that line and the chin. Of course, you must study the model when drawing the features, but the information gained from working with the diagrams and egg heads should also help you to get the features in the right places.

**MATERIALS**

**Surface**

19″ × 25″ (48cm × 64cm) white charcoal paper

**Charcoal**

two sticks medium vine charcoal, two sticks soft vine charcoal, charcoal pencil (soft or 6B)

**Other Supplies**

kneaded eraser, drawing board, masking tape or clamps, easel, old towel or paper towels, hand mirror, spray fixative, kitchen timer

1 **Tone the Paper**

Rub soft charcoal over the white paper to a value 4 midtone and smooth it in with your fingers a bit.

**Looking for Darks**

Step back to the looking spot and squint, studying the model's head for the most obvious feature, which will usually be a dark value. It may be the hair, or the shadow on the side of the face, the eye sockets, the area alongside the nose, or the shadow under the chin on the neck. When drawing or painting always begin with the part you are most sure of. Add this most obvious area to your block-in.

Work with the piece of charcoal on its side (not its tip) for a broad effect. Usually the eye shapes go in next — the whole eye cavity. They should be just dark ovals now. You're not drawing the eyes, just placing them. Remember, shadow is the area where direct light does not strike the form. Add the other shadows, squinting all the while. Don't try to perfect any features yet. (We just need to know where the darks go; we can't have lights later without darks now.)

Check your shadows by looking back over your shoulder in a hand mirror, comparing the model and the drawing. Look for and correct distortions, particularly any lopsidedness. Remember your center line. Double-check that one side of the face is not wider than the other, a common fault.

Then turn around and compare the model with your drawing, squinting hard. With your fingertips, tap out the areas that have become too dark. Now you're beginning the modeling of the head. Wipe your hands clean before tapping out the charcoal or you'll end up just moving it around! Don't rub, just tap. You now have a head with halftones (the gray tone rubbed on the paper) and shadows, but no lights.

**Looking for Lights**

From here on, begin to define the lights and thereby refine the shadow shapes, using strokes that follow the form if you can.

Where do you see light areas? On the light side of the forehead? Surely on the light side of the hair. Under the keystone area at the bridge of the nose? On the cheekbone? The area between the nose and the upper lip? Perhaps the lower lip catches the light, and part of the chin and neck. Squint, and you'll discern those lights. If the model is wearing a white collar, lift that out now with your fingertips or a kneaded eraser. It will help you judge the values on the face and head. Try not to get darks in the lights or lights in the darks.

To get really clean light areas, lift them with a clean point of your kneaded eraser. You really do have to lift — rubbing will only smear the charcoal. After each touch, when the point of the eraser is dirty, pull the eraser into another point. If you keep the eraser in the warmth of your other hand, it will remain pliant.

Your head now has lights, shadows and halftones. You have not yet attempted to finish the eyes, nose or mouth.

2 **Block In the Head**

Place the head on the paper, drawn is an egg-oval, and place the eye line and the central vertical line. Mark the brow, nose and mouth lines.

**Working Out the Features**

I can tell you how to draw the features, but I can't tell you in what sequence to do them. We will start with the eyes, followed by the nose, the mouth, the ears, the hair. This is not, however, the way a portrait is done. No one finishes the eyes first, then the nose, then the mouth. You have to work over the entire head. Working on the eye socket, you see how that helps you to define the temple. And working on the inner corner of the eye leads you to the structure of the nose bridge. This may in turn lead you to the bony part of the nose and then the tip of the nose, which leads you to the cheek, to the mouth and the chin. Then the artist returns to each area, refining with ever more subtle adjustments until all the parts come to a finish at once and the portrait is done. For the sake of clarity, I will cover the features one by one.

Before you draw, read through the following material from eyes through hair and then refer to it as you need it. Drawing a charcoal portrait is just like any other activity. The first time you'll be awkward and may return to the information frequently, but as you get to your eleventh and twelfth portraits you'll develop your own rhythm and sequence, and will only have to refer to these pages when you get stuck.

Work in any order you like, just so that you develop each feature as well as you can and relate each one to the others. Remember, every approach is valid and will produce excellent likenesses.

**The Eyes**

The entire eye area is now dark. With a pointed end of the medium charcoal, draw the upper and lower eyelids as they follow the round form of the eyeball. Then put the fold in the upper eyelid, if you see one, and draw the iris, working on both eyes at once. Please don't try to finish one eye and then go to the other. It's more difficult — and they may never focus!

3 **Add the Darks**

After squinting, add darks first in the hair, then the eye ovals, alongside the nose, the upper lip, under the lower lip, and on the neck.

**Charcoal Corrections Hint**

If you have to change something in a charcoal drawing, don't erase. Just tap the drawing with your clean finger and lift off the mark, then redraw the line where you want it. Changes can be made easily in soft charcoal.

Molding the kneaded eraser into a point, lift out the whites of the eyes from the midtone and darks. Remember, the whites of the eyes are not white, for they are shadowed by the eyelids. If you make them too white, the eyes appear to be staring.

Now add the dark pupils and any other darks you see in the eyes. Pick out any light area on the upper and lower eyelids, then work out the shadow between the inner corner of the eye and the nose, watching for a light at the area near the tear duct. Look for the shadow under the lower lid.

Perfect the eyebrow, looking for a light spot as it follows the bone over the eye socket. Remember the eyebrow is made up of tiny hairs; draw it in many short strokes. Look at the model's eyes up close and study the eyelashes and add a few of them very delicately — not a whole series of tiny lashes like a centipede's legs.

Lay your stick of charcoal horizontally across the eyes on your drawing to be sure they're level. It's easy to get them out of line when you're working on them bit by bit.

Then, form your kneaded eraser into a clean point and deftly pick out the highlights in the eyes, at about ten o'clock if the source of light is at upper left, about two o'clock if at upper right, or where you see them. This highlight should be small. You have to do this last, because the focus of the eyes is achieved by minute adjustments between the pupil, iris and highlight, and you can't handle this with any real finesse until the head is virtually complete. Adding this highlight really brings the portrait to life.

**The Nose**

You've made the nose mark halfway between the brow line and the chin. Studying the model, decide if the nose is shorter or longer, and correct it. Sketch in the triangular shape of the nose, the top and side planes, the ball, and the wings on either side, studying the model all the while. As you worked out the area of the tear ducts of the eyes, you may want to work out the bridge of the nose. The side of the bridge away from the light may be very dark, so do nothing there. But there should be a light on the bridge of the nose just below the keystone area where eyeglasses rest. Is there light on the bony part of the nose? Does the light on the side plane spill over onto the cheek? Squint hard and you'll see these lights. Lift them out with a clean point of your eraser.

Add dark to the underplane of the nose and the nostrils. This leads us to the small indentation from the center of the nose down to the bowed center of the upper lip. Is this visible on your model? Is it shadowed? Add this and the rounded shadow side of the "muzzle" area, the skin that travels over the upper teeth and curves around to meet the cheek.

4 **Work on Lights, Darks and Halftones**

Pick out the lights with your fingertips or a kneaded eraser. Define the darks. Make the halftones visible.

**Eye Highlight Hint**

If the highlight you've drawn in an eye isn't right the first time, darken the area and try again. These highlights should be quite sharp and clear to indicate the wetness of the eyeball. It will never look right if you keep dabbing at it with the eraser. Clean and careful does the job.

**The Mouth**

Hold your charcoal vertically at arm's length and line up the corners of the mouth with some part of the eyes, as in the illustration. Are the corners of the mouth directly beneath the pupils? Place both corners, and then the center of the upper lip. Don't forget to break the line between the lips.

Put in the shadow in the corners of the mouth if you see any. Add the shadow under the lower lip, and the upper lip, which may be entirely in shadow. With the clean point of your eraser, lift the lights where you see them: just above the upper lip, on the light side of the rounded "muzzle" area, and on the lower lip — anywhere else?

**The Ears**

Sketch in marks to indicate the top and bottom of the ears, the top of the ear at the brow line. Draw the flat oval disk of each ear at the same slant as the ears on your model. Refine the disk shapes into better ear shapes. Put in the line forming the fold at the upper rim, the helix, then the bowl, the two small flaps (whatever is visible) and the earlobes.

Look for darks in the ears. The ear on the shadow side of the head may be totally dark, with no detail discernible. Study the lights and pick them out with a clean point of your eraser. There's usually a bright light on the helix and on the lobe. You may see others.

**The Hair**

Hair should be treated as a mass, not as lines. Lay the charcoal on its side and block in the darks. Blend the edges in at least two places where the hair meets the background, so the head doesn't look cut out and pasted on the background, but integrated with it and the air around the head. The edges where the hair meets the face are also extremely important:soften them with your fingers. You don't want the hair to look like a wig or toupee! Then squint and decide where the highlights are lighter than the halftone of the paper, if there are any, and lift them out with the eraser. Watch how the hair flows, how it falls; let your lights describe this action.

The most important aspect of hair is its texture. The hair on an average head consists of thousands of filaments. Nothing about hair is at all like the skin over muscle over bone that makes up the face and the body. Think of ways you can show the special properties of hair — the softer edges, linear movement, the design found in waves or curls, or its sheen. Your treatment of the hair can even help express the personality of your sitter; a person with every hair in place is very different from one with loose, flyaway hair.

**Check Alignment**

Hold the charcoal vertically to align one feature with another — here, the corner of the mouth with a part of the eye. You can use a brush or a pencil for the same purpose when working in other mediums.

**Fine Tuning Values**

In putting in the features, no matter what the medium, work back and forth between the lights, darks and halftone, continually refining the drawing.

**Finishing Touches**

You now have a head with darks, halftones, lights, and well-developed features and hair. The head is integrated into the background. Look at your model very hard now, with your eyes wide open. Search for a few selected places where absolutely no light can reach, and firmly put in small dark accents with your charcoal pencil. These add sparkle, as do the highlights; check and add any highlights you've overlooked.

Look for reflected light under the chin or on the side plane of the lower jaw on the shadow side and lift these with your eraser. Reflected light can never be lighter than the halftone, and never as light as your lights. If it were, it would destroy the solid feeling of the head.

Add the collar, clean up the background with your fingers where you may have left smudges, and you're finished. You've spent at least an hour on this drawing. Anything over two hours is too long — you lose your ability to make judgments after so long a period of concentration.

Wait a day before you look again at this drawing and judge it. Correct any errors you see then, and spray it with fixative to keep it from smudging.

**Take a Closer Look (Detail)**

Notice the degree of finish and the rough texture, or _tooth_ , of the charcoal paper. Can you see how softly the linear elements defining the eyes and the mouth are handled? Can you see where the kneaded eraser has picked out the lightest lights and the highlights? And where the darkest accents are placed? We all know no portrait is ever perfect, and this close-up makes me painfully aware of an error. I think the nose tip is pulled over to the right a bit too far — do you agree?

**Wendy**

5 **Check the Finishing Touches**

Now you've worked out the features and added the highlights (where the eraser has lifted the charcoal and left clean white paper) and accents (deepest spots of dark). The hair edges are integrated into the background in places. You've tapped out the reflected lights with your fingertips, making sure they are no lighter than the halftones. After careful checking in the mirror, decide if the portrait is finished.

###  _Demonstration_

Charcoal on Tinted Paper

Let's try a portrait in more of a profile view now. You will find the procedure is the same, but the drawing problems are quite different. Have your model turn her body to one side, but adjust the head so you can barely see the other eye; this view is much more interesting to draw than a flat profile. If you're right-handed, it's easier to draw the model facing to her right (your left), and vice-versa if you're left-handed. Also be sure she is facing toward the light, not into the shadow.

In this charcoal technique we do not tone the paper; the tint of the paper is the halftone.

**Placing the Head on the Paper**

Set the timer for twenty-five minutes and have your model pose.

Step back to your looking spot, squint, look through your eyelashes, and study the head. Visualize the head on the paper. Decide where to place the top of the head, how it slants, and the size of the head. Then step up to the easel and make a light mark for the top of the head, the bottom of the chin, the outside edge of the face, and the back of the head. Try not to draw the head larger than life-size.

Placement of the head is important; you don't want it too close to the top edge, and you don't want it in the lower half of the paper either. There are no absolute rules. Later, after doing several portraits, you may want to attempt less conventional placements — even allowing the head to run off the top of the paper. We just have to learn to walk before we can run.

1 **Place the Head**

When placing the head in the picture area, be sure that the top of the head isn't too close to the top edge of the paper. Give more "air" on the side from the face to the margin, and less at the back of the head. The nose falls slightly above the vertical center of the paper, approximately midway from top to bottom.

**MATERIALS**

**Surface**

20″ × 16″ (51cm × 41cm) midtone gray charcoal paper

**Charcoal**

two sticks medium vine charcoal, two sticks soft vine charcoal, charcoal pencil (soft or 6B), white pastel

**Other Supplies**

kneaded eraser, drawing board, tacks, masking tape or clamps, easel, old towel or paper towels, hand mirror, spray fixative, kitchen timer

**Blocking In the Head**

Now that you have the general dimensions, draw the oval shape of the head within them, studying the model. Look carefully to determine the angle of the head. Is it tilting up and back, or down, or is it straight up? When you decide, draw the eye line halfway down, making it an ellipse, if necessary, to conform to the tilt of the head. This line is the most important factor in establishing the position of the head.

Add the brow line parallel to the eye line. Sketch in the vertical line in the center of the face and mark the base of the nose halfway between the brow line and the chin. Add the vertical line at the side of the head and place the ear just behind it, aligning the top of the ear with the brow line and the bottom with the nose line. Place the mouth line. Indicate the hair mass. Then place the angle of the neck cylinder, front and back, and then the collar line. You now have a blocked in head.

**Looking for Large Shapes and Darks**

Step back, squint, and look for whatever shape appears most obvious. In this near-profile it's most likely the hair mass, for in this view, the face occupies a relatively small area. Indicate the hair shape. Is it dark? Now look for shadow areas in the face. First the eye socket, then the underplane of the nose, and possibly a side plane of the nose. Then another side plane at the cheekbone, the side of the face from the temple down to the jaw and chin. Lay these areas in with the side of a small piece of charcoal. Is there dark on the neck? Anywhere else?

**Adding Lights, Refining Angles and Proportions**

Again step back. You can't define the lights without careful attention to the edge of the face, so hold up your charcoal at arm's length so it appears to lie along the outside edge of the model's forehead. Then walk up and add this line to your drawing. Step back and repeat this process for the line of the angle of the nose, the cheekbone to the lower jaw, and along the jawline to the center of the chin. Lay all these angles in lightly. Look in the mirror at the model and at your blocked-in head at the same time to check for accuracy. Use your kneaded eraser, but try brushing the incorrect lines off with a paper towel first, or tapping them off with your finger, then blow away the charcoal dust.

**Key Line Placement in Tilted Profile View**

The head of my model, Anne, is almost in total profile and tilted. This makes the eye line a downward ellipse and the central vertical line a way around to her right. The ear line is a quarter of the way around the head to her left side.

**Working Out the Features**

We have defined the outside shapes of the nose, forehead, mouth, chin and neck. Now we'll move within the head shape. Looking at the model, hold your charcoal stick horizontally and sight check the alignment of the top of the ear with the brow line. Is the top of the ear higher or lower than the eyebrow? Draw the ear, using medium charcoal now for more precise drawing.

Draw the eye shape, the brow, then the bridge of the nose, the hollow at the inner corner of the eye, and the nose. Holding the charcoal vertically and at arm's length, check how the wing of the nostril lines up with the inner and outer corner of the eye. See how far the mouth and chin project beyond the nearer brow, and sight other vertical alignments such as the corner of the mouth and the eye. Check both the model and your drawing in the mirror for all these relationships.

Finally, refine the shape of the hair and any collar area. You now have a head with a carefully drawn near-profile silhouette, darks, and halftones.

**Placing the Lights**

Now, with a white pastel in hand, squint very hard and decide where the lightest areas are — lighter than the halftone gray of the paper. Then erase all charcoal from areas where you want the whites before you place them. (You may want a few lights in the hair, for example.) Lay in these areas very lightly at first, and don't put in too many or you'll destroy the form of the head. You must be sure if the area is light, halftone or dark shadow. Don't get any whites in the charcoal shadows or charcoal in the white pastel areas — your drawing will be really muddy.

**Adding the Highlights**

When we were working on white paper, we let the white of the paper serve as our highlights. Now we're using tinted paper, so put the highlights in firmly now with the point of the white pastel.

Search out the highlights on the model's head — maybe at the bridge of the nose, on the cheekbone, the tip of the nose, and on the lower lip. Enjoy adding a crisp light in the eye only if you see one.

2 **Add Shadows and Check Features Alignment**

With much squinting, note the direction of the light and lay in the resulting shadow shapes. Consider angles of the features. Each feature has its own distinctive shape and direction. Still, they must all work together.

**Highlights Hint**

Highlights are great fun to put in and add considerable vivacity to the portrait; keep them small and bright. The highest light is often on the forehead as it is closest to the light source.

**Dark Accents and Reflected Lights**

Accents could be in the iris and pupil of the eye, a dot or two in the nostril, the corner of the mouth, and in the hair. Look for reflected light under the chin and lift it out with your kneaded eraser (no white pastel here). Add the darks and lights of the collar. Clean up any fingerprints in the background with the eraser. You could leave the tint of the paper as your background or develop it with shadow. Having a darker background behind the light side of the face throws the head into relief.

This drawing should take ninety minutes to two hours, or four posing sessions. Put it away so you can look at it the next day with a fresh eye; correct it then, if you need to, and spray it with fixative.

**Comparing the Portraits**

My portrait of Wendy in the previous demonstration is what's known as _painterly_ — it looks as if it were done with a broad brush rather than a pointed drawing instrument. The lights, shadows and halftones are quite developed, giving it a feeling of solid mass. Line does not play a large part in this work.

This portrait of Anne, on the other hand, is more linear and less "round" or sculptural. This may be partially because Anne is in a semiprofile pose, which can look quite flat. However, many artists believe it's easier to get a good likeness with a profile. Putting a darker background behind the face sometimes helps throw the head into relief, but a sharp contour line around the face and head may make it look pasted on the background. Varying the weight of your profile contour line, making it lighter where direct light strikes the form and heavier on the shadow underplanes, should help the head to appear more rounded. Softening the edge of the hair shape in at least two places and allowing it to blend into the background also helps.

3 **Refine and Make Adjustments**

Refine the features, the head and the hair shapes. Add small darks and lift out lights. I was so busy working on the features that I lost the likeness — very easy to do when looking at the parts and not the whole. It looks like a round-faced, even chubby, person; not like Anne. Did she move her head a bit? Did I change my viewing position?

The neck edge of the turtleneck sweater is too straight. Force the line to become a rounded ellipse like the eye and brow lines. Notice how the right and left eyes differ.

4 **Finishing Touches**

After considerable effort, Anne's character begins to emerge again. The delicacy of her head is a very important part of the likeness. I've done and redone the line defining the far side of the face, a very tricky area in a head turned away this far.

Check in the mirror, then lift out the charcoal and put in the highlights with white pastel. Add a few dark accents in the pupils of the eyes, at the bridge of the nose, in the corners of the mouth, under the chin and behind the earring. The expression is true now.

The turtleneck is still too heavy. I don't like turtlenecks for portraits very much. They cover the neck right up to the chin and, to me, separate the head from the body. I changed it to suit myself. Place a slightly darker value behind the white hair at left and also at right to make it look as if the tone is behind the head, giving the illusion of a three-dimensional head.

This portrait should take about two hours and fifteen minutes or five posing periods. Sign and date the drawing and spray it with fixative.

**Soft Edges (Detail)**

Note how softly I handled the edges; there are no hard lines defining the far side of the face, and there are none around the mouth. I also kept the white highlights to a minimum.

##  _Using Color_

**Ann Alone** detail) Watercolor on 140-lb. (300gsm) cold press 22″ × 30″ (56cm × 76cm) Private collection

**Y** ou'll need to know something about color before moving on to paint portraits in oil and watercolors. What you've learned from charcoal portraits will be useful. You now know about modeling the form, distinguishing the lights from halftones and darks. You are aware of soft and hard edges and ways of handling texture. But when we work in color, we add another facet to the problem. Of course, we also add excitement!

The perception of color is such a personal experience. Each of us sees colors differently, influenced by associations from as far back as childhood, by preferences for what we think is beautiful, by the sharpness of our vision, and by the possibility of some color blindness. Our reaction to color is psychological and even visceral — there can be no question that color affects the emotions.

In this chapter we will develop a vocabulary so we can discuss color intelligently in the ensuing chapters on color techniques. You'll find several projects here that use color in ways to help you understand it better and feel more confident about mixing the colors you want. Then we will be ready for flesh tones and hair mixtures.

###  _Color as Hue_

_Hue_ is the name of the color: red, yellow, orange, purple. Red, yellow and blue are considered _primary colors_. To mix any color you must start with one or two of these three, for you can't mix red, blue, or yellow by combining other colors.

We are going to make a _color wheel_ , which will give us the know-how to mix the three primary colors into fifteen more, plus a neutral gray. We'll learn to find harmonious or dramatic color combinations and how to neutralize one hue with another.

**Materials**

You will need Lemon Yellow, Alizarin Crimson and Cobalt Blue oil paints in tubes, plus the following materials:a disposable paper palette, 12″ × 16″ (30cm × 41cm), for oils; a ballpoint pen; ¼-inch (6mm) flat square synthetic sable brush (called a _bright_ ); a palette knife; gum turpentine or odorless paint thinner in a homemade brush washer (see the following instructions); paper towels; and an alkyd (Winsor & New-ton Liquin) oil painting medium.

**Note:** For all the charts in this chapter done on the disposable paper palette, we will add a few drops of oil painting medium to our paints to speed the drying process, which would take about two days under normal drying conditions.

**Color Mixing Hint**

Notice that the more hues you mix together, the less clarity and brilliance you have. Remember this later when you are painting portraits. Try to get the hue you want by mixing only two colors (not counting black or white) or possibly three. Any more will give you mud, and the color in your paintings will lack impact.

**Making a Brush Washer**

You can make an excellent brush washer by taking an empty tuna fish can, punching nail holes all over the bottom of it, putting it upside down in an empty one-pound coffee or tomato can, and filling this can about one-third full with turpentine or odorless paint thinner. All the paint sediment filters to the bottom of the can, so the turpentine on top is always clean. Hammer the nail holes from the outside in, that way the rough metal edges are on the inside and your brushes will not be ruined. Keep the plastic lid on the can when you're not using it so the turpentine doesn't evaporate. You can use the same cans for months, depending on how often you paint, until the turpentine no longer clears upon standing or the dirty paint sediment oozes up from under the holes. Then just throw the whole thing out and make a new brush washer. The brush washer is also good for painting outside your studio; just don't spill it! (A word of caution: the can must be metal or it will leak.)

**Washing Your Brushes With Soap**

No matter how clean your brushes are after rinsing them in turpentine or paint thinner, you still should wash them with soap and water at the end of every painting day. Wet the brush, scrub it into a cake of soap, then scrub the bristles in the palm of your hand. Rinse in warm water, squeeze out the excess water, shape the brush with your fingers and lay it flat to dry overnight. This way, they will last longer and respond better.

**Making a Color Wheel**

Squeeze out about 1 inch (25mm) of oil paint of each color along the top edge of the paper palette: Lemon Yellow (left), Alizarin Crimson (center) and Cobalt Blue (right). Carefully tear off this palette sheet and tape or clip it onto a white paper or cardboard. (You'll be mixing color on this sheet throughout this chapter.) Using a ballpoint pen, trace this color wheel illustration onto the next top sheet of the paper palette.

With the flat brush, paint the primary hues in the designated areas on the color wheel. Wash the brush clean in turpentine before each new color, wiping it on a paper towel until no color comes off. You can mix your paints with a palette knife if you wish; just wipe it clean between colors. Add only a drop or two of medium to make the paint easy to apply; it should be thick and buttery so it covers well.

Next, paint in the _secondary_ hues. For green start with Lemon Yellow and add Cobalt Blue a bit at a time; you'll have to make several mixtures to get a green — not yellowish, not bluish, but halfway between. Again starting with Lemon Yellow, add touches of Alizarin Crimson until you arrive at an orange that is halfway between yellow and red. Repeat this procedure adding Alizarin Crimson to Cobalt Blue for a purple hue halfway between the two. Paint the three secondaries in their spaces. Do your best to keep the edges of each hue from mixing with its neighbor.

Then mix the _tertiary_ hues. Put a bit of Alizarin Crimson into the orange mixture and mix until you get a red-orange (halfway between red and orange). There will be five more tertiaries to mix: yellow-orange (Lemon Yellow plus orange), yellow-green (add green to Lemon Yellow), blue-green, blue-purple and red-purple. Paint each mixture in its proper place. Then mix the _quaternary_ hues from the tertiaries:russet, dark orange, citron, dark green, olive, and dark purple, using the same procedure.

When you're finished, mix together whatever is left on your palette for a neutral non-color and paint this in the center circle.

After it dries, tape your color wheel to white paper or board so the colors will appear more solid, then tape the wheel on the wall of your studio or inside the lid of your paint box where you can see it and use it often enough to commit it to memory.

**Working in Watercolor**

Trace this color wheel and transfer it onto watercolor paper. Squeeze Alizarin Crimson, Lemon Yellow and Cobalt Blue onto a watercolor palette or a dinner plate, leaving room for more colors to be added later. Fill in the primary hues first, then the secondary hues, mixing carefully. Allowing each wash to dry before applying the one next to it, mix and fill in the tertiary and quaternary hues. Finally, mix yellow, red and blue for the neutral gray in the center.

###  _Color as Value_

The word _value_ used in describing color means the lightness or darkness of the hue. In this study we do not change the hue; we change only the value. If we say pale pink, we're speaking of a light-value red; if we say maroon, we mean a deep-value red. To lighten the value, add white. To deepen the value, add black. Adding black sometimes changes the hue; for example, black added to yellow does make it darker, but the yellow changes hue and becomes green. To make yellow darker without changing its hue, add Raw Umber.

In the color-as-value Chart, you see Titanium White at value 1 become progressively darker toward black at value 7 as you move across the top row of squares from left to right. Each color also has its own row of squares (horizontally) and is painted in progressively darker values between value 1 (white) and value 7 (black).

Each of these colors at full strength has its own intrinsic value built right into it. The position of the color on the chart is predicated upon this value; for example, Lemon Yellow is value 2 — light; and Cadmium Yellow Orange is value 3 — mid-light. Cadmium Red Light is value 4 — midtone, while Alizarin Crimson, Ultramarine Blue, and Viridian Green are all value 5 — mid-dark. Raw Umber and Burnt Umber are value 6 — dark.

**Making a Color-as-Value Chart**

By completing this chart, you will learn how to make any of these pigments lighter or darker without changing its hue. Working with this chart will greatly increase your awareness of value and your sensitivity to value change, which is of major importance to a portrait painter.

As with the color wheel, save the chart you make for reference.

**Value Hints**

  * To lighten any of the oil colors, add white. To darken a color (lower its value) without changing its hue, you need to know the following:

  * Lemon Yellow is lowered in value by the addition of Raw Umber.

  * Cadmium Yellow Orange is lowered in value by the addition of Burnt Umber.

  * Cadmium Red Light is lowered in value by the addition of Burnt Umber.

  * Alizarin Crimson, Ultramarine Blue, Viridian Green, Raw Umber and Burnt Umber are all darkened with black.

**Materials**

We will continue using oil, with more colors added. The rest of the materials remain the same: Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Cadmium Yellow Orange (by Grumbacher), Cadmium Red Light, Alizarin Crimson, Ultramarine Blue, Viridian Green, Raw Umber, Burnt Umber and Ivory Black.

**Procedure**

On your paper palette, squeeze out about 2 inches (5cm) of Titanium White and about 1 inch (25mm) of paint in each of the nine hues in the order in which they are given: White in the upper left corner of the palette, then Lemon Yellow, Cadmium Yellow Orange, Cadmium Red Light, and so on across the top to black in the upper right corner. Don't crowd the colors on the palette: one color should not touch another. Carefully tear off this top sheet with the paint on it and set it to one side. You'll mix your colors on this sheet.

As we did in the color wheel project, slip the chart under the new top sheet of the paper palette; you'll be able to see the chart squares through the translucent palette sheet and trace them with a ballpoint pen.

Paint Lemon Yellow in its designated square under value 2 — light, then Cadmium Yellow Orange in its designated square, then Cadmium Red Light, Alizarin Crimson, Ultramarine Blue, Viridian Green, Raw Umber, Burnt Umber and black, each one pure and unadulterated, in its square as printed on the chart.

Starting with Lemon Yellow at the top, you will see that it is already only one value away from white, so we don't need to do anything about mixing it to a lighter value. To create the darker values 3, 4, 5 and 6, mix Lemon Yellow with Raw Umber in graduated progression toward value 7 — black. Add Raw Umber to the yellow, first in tiny amounts, then more and more, darker and darker.

Squint very hard to compare your Lemon Yellow-Raw Umber mixtures with the gray values at the top of the chart. Do you have a value 3 mid-light and 4, 5 and 6? If not, adjust your mixtures lighter or darker until they are as close as you can get them. Paint the four Lemon Yellow values in their allotted squares.

It isn't easy to mix color exactly to a precise value. You have to squint hard to match a color value to a gray value. This is excellent practice for your future portrait paintings where you must constantly judge color as value.

Paint each square a flat, even hue rather than streaking it with light or dark. And paint it out to the edges of the square, not just a blob in the center.

Moving on to Cadmium Yellow Orange, mix this hue with enough white to make a lighter value corresponding to value 2 — light. Start with white and add a small amount of Cadmium Yellow Orange to it to reach value 2. Darken the hue with Burnt Umber. Add Burnt Umber bit by bit until you feel you have a value 4, midtone, value 5, and value 6. When you feel they are correct, paint them in their corresponding squares.

Continue downward, row by row, with the other pure colors you have painted on the chart. All are lightened by white. Check the Value Hints sidebar for the pigment that darkens each respective color.

This chart, with all its subtle value gradations, will take some time to finish. Try not to rush it.

You now have an extremely beautiful color-as-value chart, and you know a great deal about changing the value of a color without changing its hue. This chart is really helpful when you are searching for color harmonies.

**Value and Color Names**

For auto manufacturers, interior designers, and paint salesmen — and the dozens of other professionals who deal with color but are not artists — the name of the color changes all the time. The words "pink," "rose" and "wine" are used to designate differing values of red. To the artist, "pink" is still a light value red. "Rose" is a midvalue red, and "wine" describes a deep-value red. To the artist, the hue has remained the same; only the value has changed.

More examples of these non-artist's color names and artist's hues are:

  * Peach is a value 2 — light orange.

  * Rust is a value 5 — mid-dark orange.

  * Aqua is a value 2 — light green-blue.

  * Teal is a value 5 — mid-dark green-blue.

  * Lime, celery and apple are all value 2 or 3 light or mid-light greens.

  * Forest, pine and cedar are all value 5 or 6 mid-dark or dark greens.

**Value Awareness**

Skillful use of values is extremely important in painting portraits. Close values create harmony, while extremely contrasting values add excitement to a painting. A painting in light values (say 1 to 4) is termed a _high-key_ painting, while one of values 4 to 7 is called _low key_. A painting done only in middle values may lack sparkle or punch; adding touches of strong lights and darks could revive it and give it contrast and life.

**Note:** Some teachers call values _tones_. They will say, "a light tone against a midtone," meaning a light value against a middle value. In describing the values on a head, they may speak of "the light value, the midtone, and the shadow area." Don't let all this confuse you; the words are different, but the instructor is still talking about value — light and dark.

**Checking Values**

To check values when you're working in color, photograph the painting in black and white. If the darks are too black, you will know you have to lighten them. Frequently only an eyebrow or a corner of the mouth is too dark, or you may have painted the lights moving too quickly into the darks. These errors are easily corrected by trying to be more subtle.

**Watercolor Values Hint**

If you would like to make the color-as-value chart using watercolor, trace and transfer the chart onto white paper. The same colors used in the oil chart will lower (darken) the values of the watercolor hues. (See the Value Hints sidebar.) To make watercolor lighter in value, of course, you must add more water to the color rather than white pigment.

**Color-as-Value Chart**

###  _Color as Intensity_

In this project we do not change the hue or the value of the color, only the _intensity_. The word "intensity" here means the brilliance or saturation of the hue. A pure primary red, seen in bright sunlight, is absolutely at 100 percent intensity, a totally saturated hue. This red is at its maximum "redness."It cannot be any redder. To paint a 100 percent intensity red in oil or watercolor, we must have a pure red pigment, with no other color (including black or white) added to it.

Now let's move that 100 percent intensity red out of the sunlight and look at it under a porch roof. What do we have? The color is still red, but its brilliance is diminished; it's duller. Perhaps the red is seen now at 70 percent of its full intensity.

If we were to paint this red in shadow, we would say we need a lowintensity red. How do we get it? The color wheel presents the answer: We diminish the intensity of a color by adding its complement. The _complement_ of any hue is found directly opposite it on the color wheel. In the case of red, the complement is green. To gray a yellow, add purple, its complement. To gray an orange, add its complement, blue.

Lay a straight line across the wheel, through its center, from any hue, and you will arrive at its complement on the opposite side, whether the hue is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

These graying processes work both ways, of course; as green diminishes the intensity of red, so red diminishes the intensity of green. As purple dulls yellow, the yellow diminishes the intensity of purple. As orange diminishes the intensity of blue, so blue dulls the orange.

If you mix enough green with your red so that the mixture is totally neutralized — appearing neither greenish nor reddish — you will have a neutral gray.

**Making Colors Appear Less Intense**

Any hue when mixed with its complement is diminished in intensity. The following project will show you how to make a color appear less intense — that is, how to tone down or neutralize a color.

**Procedure**

You'll need the same materials as before, but squeeze out just three colors (no white or black): Lemon Yellow, Alizarin Crimson and Cobalt Blue. Carefully tear a clean sheet from the paper palette to use for a mixing surface.

Working with a ballpoint pen as before, trace the intensity charts. You'll paint on this sheet. Paint the Alizarin Crimson of your color wheel in the space at the left end of the first chart. Then put your color-wheel green mixed from Lemon Yellow and Cobalt Blue in the space at the opposite end. Paint each color out to the edges of its assigned space.

Make several mixtures of this red and green on your palette sheet and select the most neutral (neither reddish nor greenish) one. Paint it in the central space on the red-green chart.

Starting with the red, make more red-green mixtures and select those that you think should be in spaces 2, 3 and 4, moving from full-intensity red to neutral.

Repeat the process with full-intensity green, painting gradations from green to neutral in spaces 8, 7 and 6.

Repeat the procedure for the next charts using orange and Cobalt Blue, mixing the orange from Lemon Yellow and Alizarin Crimson. Then paint the third chart using Lemon Yellow and its complement, purple (made from Alizarin Crimson and Cobalt Blue). Again, allow them to dry and save your color-as-intensity charts and keep them handy for ready reference.

**Further Neutrals Study**

Neutrals made from the three different combinations are not the same neutral color. Each complementary pair produces a different neutral. Some are brownish, some gray, some more violet. Of course, none are brilliant colors. There are any number of other reds, yellows, and blues, too, and each pairing of these with their complements will produce a different neutral as well. You may want to work with them and prove this to yourself. The study of color is endless and always gratifying.

**Color-as-Intensity Charts**

**Making Colors More Intense**

Color pigments have their limitations, but by using complementary colors we can make any hue appear more intense too. For example, to make red appear its most brilliant, we surround it with its complement, green. All greens — light, dark, bright or dull — will intensify red. The following exercise involves painting squares within squares to explore this color phenomenon.

There is a half page of squares for each primary and secondary color. Paint specific colors in the outer squares surrounding each of the six hues and then study the results. You will see the way the same color appears to change from one square to the next, depending upon the surrounding hue, even though we know the color in the inside squares is precisely the same throughout.

Again, you will be using the primary colors plus Ivory Black and Titanium White, laid out on a sheet of the paper palette. Carefully remove this sheet and set it to one side; you'll be mixing colors on this sheet. With a ballpoint pen, trace the squares from the red chart on the next clean palette sheet. Paint the entire square at the left and each of the five inner squares Alizarin Crimson, right out to the edge.

Paint each of the five outer squares a different color as suggested, as smoothly as possible, trying not to let these colors get mixed into the crimson of the inner squares. Remove this red chart from the palette and let it dry.

Trace the yellow chart on the next clean paper palette sheet and paint the square at left Lemon Yellow, and all the other inside squares as well. Paint the surrounding squares as indicated. Remove this sheet and proceed with the other four charts in the same manner, painting the inner and outer squares as indicated.

Upon completing these charts, you'll understand how a full-intensity hue can be further enhanced by its complement and how an artist can push one color into an aggressive or a passive mode. Keep these charts for future reference.

**More Ideas for Neutralizing Color**

It's useful for a portrait painter to recognize the quiet beauty of neutral colors, and that mixing complements is the best way to get them. You have learned how to gray, or neutralize, the primary and secondary colors. If you wish to experiment with tertiary colors (as complements), make similar charts and proceed as before. The tertiaries neutralize very quickly as they are already made from three other hues, which diminishes the brilliance of each hue considerably.

Totally neutral mixtures are not always made by mixing 50 percent of one color with 50 percent of its complement. For example, it takes only a very small amount of purple to neutralize Lemon Yellow, but it would take quite a good bit of yellow to neutralize the purple. Do you start with orange or Cobalt Blue in combining complements? Experiment and see which works best, but it's usually easiest to start with the lightest color when making a mixture.

**Color as Temperature**

Most artists believe that yellows and reds are warm colors, and blues and greens are cool colors. Of course, this is an oversimplification; every color can be warmed or cooled. Yellows get warmer as they go toward red and cooler in the other direction on the color wheel, toward green. Even reds can be warmer going toward yellow and cooler leaning toward blue (orange-red or vermilion as opposed to cyclamen, fuchsia, or wine). Purples can go either way; they cool the red and warm the blue. This brings us to the understanding that color is really relative. In an all-green painting, even a pinkish purple will look hot. In a yellow and orange painting, a yellow-green will look cool! Each color is affected by whatever color is adjacent to it.

I hope you're beginning to understand the idea that "all color is relative."Sure, a red is a red, but, as artists, we are in control — we can alter red dramatically by the hues, values, intensities and temperatures of color we place next to it.

From now on, when we discuss painting flesh tones and say "warm or cool your color," you will know that the warm colors are yellows and reds, and the cools are blues and greens.

###  _Color Ideas for Portraits_

**The Use of Complements**

Do you begin to see the color wheel as a valuable aid to a portrait painter? Suppose your sitter has a very ruddy complexion — maybe too ruddy — and you decide you must de-emphasize the hot coloring. But you can't paint him without vivid coloring or the portrait won't look like him. What can you do? One thing you know you can't do is paint the background green! Green would make the complexion appear even ruddier. If you use the hues nearer red on the color wheel, the vivid skin will contrast less with the surrounding background and appear more pleasing. On the other hand, you may want to emphasize a sitter's unusual red hair, and using green in the background or clothing would help to accomplish this.

But changing the hue isn't all. By altering the value and the intensity of these nearby hues, many choices are open to us. I recommend that you do several color studies before you begin a portrait, perhaps 5″ × 7″ (13cm × 18cm) or 8″ × 10″ (20cm × 25cm), so you can choose the very best color arrangement for your client rather than just settling for whatever is there.

**Harmony From Analogous Colors**

To ensure color harmony within the portrait, play it safe by using colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel: these are called _analogous_ colors. For example, using yellow with yellow-orange and yellow-green will never present a color problem. Blue-purple with blue and purple would be another harmonious scheme. Use your inventiveness by altering the values and intensities of these analogous color ideas — then they will never be boring. One idea could be a large area of blue-purple with a sharp blue-green used as the accent. Can you think of another exciting color idea using analogous colors?

**Harmony From Split-Complement Color Schemes**

A split-complement is a pair of complementary colors on the color wheel with one complement split into the two hues adjacent to it. Look at your color wheel and at the red-green complement. Split the green into the blue-green and yellow-green on either side (eliminate the true green). There is your split-complementary scheme: red, yellow-green and blue-green. Blue with red-orange and yellow-orange is another. Yellow with red-purple and blue-purple another. Blue-purple with yellow and orange still another.

These combinations are slightly more complex than a direct complement and can give a bit more unusual effect to your painting. You still have all the options of changing the values and intensities of one or all three of the hues.

###  _Painting Flesh Tones_

The first time I was confronted with a live model I thought all this talk about flesh tones was pretty silly. I said to myself, "What's so hard about painting flesh tones? I'll just mix the color to match the skin on the back of my hand." I mixed a color and tried it on my skin, and mixed and tried and mixed and tried, and after a while I began to understand what all the fuss was about. There wasn't any way to match that marvelous skin — for good reasons. Skin is made up of many thin and translucent layers; you can see blue, brown, pink, green and even lavender. Skin is a live organ made up of blood and tissue, muscle and cells. We, as artists, have only paint — pigments made from natural earths, elements, or chemicals. We can paint a semblance of the skin, but we cannot match it. Remember, art is not life; art is the illusion of life.

Nevertheless, flesh tones always seem to be the biggest stumbling block for students of portrait painting. To get you started, we are going to mix them from just three colors plus white — what we call a "limited palette."

**Using a Limited Palette and Oil Paints**

We will be working on this chart of flesh tones with Titanium White, Raw Sienna (Winsor & Newton), Light Red, and Cobalt Blue — less intense versions of the primaries. (By the way, Light Red is not Cadmium Red Light; it is an earth color, like red clay.) Squeeze these four pigments out on a sheet from your paper palette, tear it off, and set it to one side for mixing. With a ballpoint pen, draw six panels the size of those from the Flesh Tones in Oils — Limited Palette chart on the next sheet of the paper palette.

This limited palette exercise will simplify your first color portrait lesson, and you may be astounded at all that these three colors plus white can do. In truth, this is a good choice of pigments for beginning any portrait, even after you have gained more experience. Feel free to substitute other colors for these three. Experiment! Just be sure to write down the names of the colors you used for future reference.

**Flesh Tones in Oils — Limited Palette**

a. Titanium White and Raw Sienna

b. Titanium White and Light Red

c. Titanium White and Cobalt Blue

**One Color at a Time**

Take the time now to familiarize yourself with these three colors by playing with them, intermixing them on your palette with the palette knife. Now take some white and mix Raw Sienna with it, making four mixtures in values from very pale to pure color. Using a brush, paint these mixtures in one of the panels ( _a_ ) you've drawn, with the lightest value at left, darkest at right.

Then mix the Light Red the same way — paint the four values shown in panel _b_ , light to dark, left to right. Do the same with the Cobalt Blue in panel _c_. Cobalt Blue is an expensive pigment but it is the clearest blue and is especially useful in flesh tones.

**True Flesh Tone Mixtures**

Now intermix the white with Raw Sienna and Light Red, from palest tint to saturated color. Add a bit more to the Raw Sienna, then a bit more to the Light Red. Paint these mixtures as shown in panel _d_. Do the same with white, Light Red and Cobalt Blue. You'll find some beautiful grays for halftones and exquisite warm shadow colors here. Paint these hues as in panel _e_.

Then mix the white, Raw Sienna and Cobalt Blue. You'll be surprised at the subtle warm greens you get from this combination. Make them pale to pure, then more golden, then more bluish. These are marvelous low-key greens for flesh. Yes, there are greens in the face and neck, very quiet ones like these. These mixtures should be painted as shown on panel _f_.

**Color Mixing Hint**

Always add color to white, not white to color, or you'll have mounds of excess color to contend with!

d. Titanium White, Raw Sienna and Light Red

e. Titanium White, Light Red and Cobalt Blue

f. Titanium White, Raw Sienna and Cobalt Blue

**Darks for Flesh Tones and Shadows**

Tear off a fresh sheet from the paper palette and trace the panels _g_ through _i_. On this sheet you'll be painting mixtures that'll give vibrant darks for flesh tones and shadows.

Mix Raw Sienna and Light Red together without white to make a hot burnt clay color. These two do not produce a real dark. Paint them the same as those in panel _g_. Then blend Raw Sienna and Cobalt Blue together without white. Here's a good dark! Make a brownish hue with more Raw Sienna, a deep greenish blue with more Cobalt Blue. Paint these the same as shown in panel _h_. Now mix Light Red and Cobalt Blue together without white. Good powerful darks, deep eggplant purple hue, deep red-browns. Paint this pair as you see in panel _i_.

Write in the names of the colors of each mix with a permanent marker, so you'll be able to refer to them when needed. Keep the charts handy for further portraits.

By now you're aware that Light Red has more tinting strength than Raw Sienna or Cobalt Blue. If you're not careful it will dominate every mixture it's in.

**Flesh Color Families in Oils — A Full Palette**

Study this chart. To do this color study, we will use the same method used previously. Squeeze the colors onto the top palette sheet and set it aside. Trace the chart onto the next sheet and paint on that image. You will need the following colors: three yellows — Naples Yellow, Yellow Ochre and Raw Sienna; four reds — Light Red, Burnt Sienna, Venetian Red, Alizarin Crimson; two blues — Cobalt Blue and Cerulean Blue; and one green — Viridian. Your small flat brush should do the work for you.

Each flesh color family is made up of two warms and a cool, plus white. Theoretically, a family could be made from any other pair of warms and a cool.

**Complexions**

A fair person with light hair has thinner skin than a person with a darker complexion, and therefore more blues are visible. In summer when these skins become tanned from the sun, the blues give way to warmer hues.

Red-haired people often have the thinnest skin of all. Their general skin tone may be extremely pale, very "white." Where their flesh tones do get warmer you'll see a unique coral or peach color, not a rose pink.

Ruddy complexions may be rosy red, red-orange, or red-violet color, and often have purples in the shadows and darks. Sallow skins have more yellow tones, are less rosy, and may be tinged with olive greens. Midtone skins on brunette people are often golden, more yellow than red, and have greens in the shadows.

There's also a type of "Irish" coloring with very black hair, fair skin, and really rosy cheeks, with hints of blue around the eyes and the temples where the skin is nearly transparent.

Dark complexions are seldom tinged with red but tend toward gold-browns, orange-browns, with halftones toward violet, and sometimes pale blues in the highlights. Use combinations of Cobalt Blue and Burnt Sienna so you can vary the complexion either to the cool or to the warm. Try not to mix the hues too much on the palette but lay them side by side on the painting and blend them as little as possible to give the skin a feeling of life. All the openings to our body are warm. At the nostrils, eye openings, and ears, you may want to add an earth red to bring vitality to the portrait, but study the individual first. (There are several earth reds, e.g., Burnt Sienna, Light Red, Venetian Red, Terra Rosa, Pozzuoli Red.)

g. Raw Sienna and Light Red

h. Raw Sienna and Cobalt Blue

i. Light Red and Cobalt Blue

**Flesh Color Families in Oils — A Full Palette**

a. White, Raw Sienna, Light Red, Cobalt Blue. Good for all-around basic flesh-tone beginnings; good for men, too.

b. White, Raw Sienna, Venetian Red, Cobalt Blue. Another basic mixture, but softer.

c. White, Yellow Ochre, Burnt Sienna, Cobalt Blue. For medium to mediumdark complexions; more yellow tones here.

d. White, Naples Yellow, Light Red, Viridian. A luminous combination; good for children.

e. White, Raw Sienna, Alizarin Crimson, Cobalt Blue. Good for ruddy complexions, for warmer medium to dark skins; also for warm shadows and darks.

f. White, Burnt Sienna, Alizarin Crimson, Viridian. Good for men and ruddy complexions.

**Flesh Color Families in Watercolor**

As in oil, each flesh color family in watercolor is made up of two warms and one cool color. Try these, then create your own combinations. Rather than darkening flesh tones with brown or black, which would make the mixtures dirty, add cools to the warm pairs and use less water to thin the pigment. This will give your watercolor portraits a clean, fresh appearance.

**Procedure**

Mixing specific colors in watercolor is far less predictable than in oil. For your practice mixtures, use Arches 140-lb. (300gms) cold press or a similar watercolor paper with some tooth, and draw the squares similar to squares _a_ through _d_ , but measuring approximately 5″ × 5″ (13cm × 13cm). Make eight or twelve panels, for some will be spoiled. Clip or tape your paper to the drawing board and prop it up at a 45 degree angle. The flesh color washes do not work so well on a flat board.

Squeeze out the following tube colors on a watercolor palette or a white dinner plate beginning at left: Cadmium Lemon, Yellow Ochre, Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake, Alizarin Crimson, Brown Madder, Cerulean Blue, Cobalt Blue, and Raw Umber.

Take up a 1-inch (25mm) flat brush and clean water and paint the first square with water only. While the paper is damp, add a wash of the first color in the family _a_ , Yellow Ochre. Don't worry about going outside the lines. Keep a paper towel or tissue in your other hand to mop up drips. Lay this one color on from top to bottom, stroke by stroke across the square, and allow it to dry. Under no circumstances should you go back into the wash, no matter how messy it looks. Let it dry. When dry, repeat the same process with a second clean wash of water, then add the second color, Scarlet Lake. You'll find this color very intense, so you won't need much pigment. When this wash is dry, repeat again with water, and, before it dries, add a wash of Cerulean Blue. As your board is tilted, the color will glide downward with the flow of the water, and so it should be stronger at the bottom third of the square. Just for fun, mix together the same three colors on your palette first, and paint one square. You will see that the results are not the same as with our glazing technique. Laying one color on at a time gives us a clear beautiful flesh tone, while premixing the same three colors gives us a gray hue.

It will take some practice before you get nice clean flesh colors, but in the process you'll learn a great deal about how much water to use, how much color, when the wash is dry and when it isn't, and many other things about handling watercolor. You will get some marvelous clear transparent flesh colors. Cut the best squares out and paste them on white paper. Pin it up on the wall for reference, recording the pigments used in each triad.

Incidentally, you may want to start painting several squares at once so you can work on one while the others are drying.

**Bands of Color on the Portrait Head**

There is one more color idea to consider when painting the portrait head. As we discovered earlier in chapter 6, the values on the head vary from lightest on the forehead band, to slightly darker on the nose-cheek-ear band, to still darker on the chin and jaw. The color of the skin tone varies in a similar manner (see Head Color Divisions sidebar). If you find yourself working on a portrait and it isn't going well and you're not sure why, try this color system. It might help to make the head more natural, more interesting, more "lifelike."

**Head Color Divisions**

The head is seen as if divided into three areas, which simulate bands across the face and head. The forehead band is seen as golden in color. The nose-cheek-ear band across the central part of the face is seen as warm, rosy or ruddy. The chin and jaw band is cooler. The chin itself may show a hint of orange, but the lower chin and the jaw become bluer, grayer or greener.

When starting the portrait head, the side planes, which are in shadow, are all one value and all one color, too. Only when the work nears completion do you paint any subtle color changes you see within that value.

**Flesh Color Families in Watercolor**

a. Yellow Ochre, Scarlet Lake, Cerulean Blue. A good combination for an all-around flesh tone, especially for children; good first wash for all complexions.

b. Raw Sienna, Brown Madder, Cobalt Blue. This is deeper than the preceding mixture; stronger, richer. Good for medium complexions; also for men.

c. Raw Umber, Alizarin Crimson, Cobalt Blue. Use for deeper colored complexions, but not reddish ones.

d. Cadmium Lemon Yellow, Scarlet Lake, Cerulean Blue. Luminous; used very pale, it's good for flesh tones in sunlight outdoors. Use it stronger for complexions with more golden tones.

###  _Painting Hair_

Shape, texture and sheen are the qualities to emphasize when painting hair in a portrait. We also have to notice the way an individual wears his or her hair, the style; this is an expression of the personality and an important part of the likeness. Painting the hair well takes some observation, but it's not difficult — in fact, it's fun to do.

Like flesh tones, hair color varies considerably from one person to another, but there's one rule you can rely upon: natural hair colors are seldom the same color all over the head. You'll see lighter and darker places, warmer and cooler colors, all on the same head. Artificially colored hair, however, is not likely to have the variation of warm and cool lights and darks.

**Painting Hair in Oils**

Study the chart showing some hair colors mixed from a full palette. Try mixing these blends yourself, using the method for the previous flesh color chart. On a clean palette sheet, squeeze out the oil colors listed below. Remove that sheet carefully, set it aside, and trace the six rectangles on to the next clean palette sheet, then paint your hair mixtures in those shapes.

The colors you will need are Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Cadmium Yellow Orange, Yellow Ochre, Raw Umber, Alizarin Crimson, Burnt Sienna, Cobalt Blue, Ultramarine Blue and Burnt Umber.

You will find you need a slightly different brushing method for painting hair. The ¼-inch (6mm) flat is about right, along with a small pointed brush. Less mixing of the colors is required. Allowing the brushstrokes to show lends a more convincing hair texture.

If you want a more smoothly brushed look, sweep your hair mixture very lightly in the direction of the strands of hair with the flat brush; this will give you the hair's sheen. (Be careful, as your work can become very slick looking if you "polish" it too much.) Following are the color mixes you'll find in a variety of hair colors, plus specific color traits to look out for.

**Light Blond**

Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Raw Umber and a touch of Cobalt Blue. This color hair is never really yellow; of course, Lemon Yellow and Cobalt Blue will turn green when mixed together — just be careful to balance them properly. For platinum blond hair, you really have to build up the lights in an _impasto_ (thick paint). You might have to heighten them with white, allow them to dry, and glaze them with Titanium White and Lemon Yellow to get them light enough.

**Light Brown or "Ash Blond"**

Titanium White, Yellow Ochre, Raw Umber, Cobalt Blue. We want to avoid any look of red in this hair; Raw Umber is a dark yellow, and yellow and blue give us a green, so we will have to adjust these two carefully.

**Red**

Titanium White (not much), Yellow Ochre, Burnt Sienna, Alizarin Crimson, Cobalt Blue, sometimes flashes of yellow-orange. The major color to use is Burnt Sienna, but you will see that mixing white with it kills its intensity. You can heighten with white, let it dry, then glaze it with Burnt Sienna, or you can paint the lights with Burnt Sienna and use a slightly damp brush to lift out where you want the lights to appear, allowing the light ground to glow through. Darks are Burnt Sienna and purple made from Alizarin Crimson and Cobalt Blue. There are never any greens in red hair.

**Dark Brown**

Titanium White, Yellow Ochre, Burnt Umber, Ultramarine Blue. Warm the highlights with Yellow Ochre, cool the highlights with more blue. Too much white and they will turn gray. Darks are Burnt Umber and Ultramarine Blue.

**Black**

Ultramarine Blue and Alizarin Crimson give a rich colorful dark, but you need to add Burnt Umber to give the color weight and body. Highlights are a cool blue from white and Ultramarine Blue, applied with a very light touch. Don't mess around in it. I never use black paint in black hair; black oil paint turns grayish when dry and doesn't have the depth of Alizarin Crimson and Ultramarine Blue.

**Gray**

Titanium White, Raw Umber, Cobalt Blue. Observe this hair color carefully; often a gray-haired person has some dark hair as well. Raw Umber and Cobalt Blue will do nicely for that. Usually people don't want yellows or gold in their gray. Your job is to paint gray hair in a very crisp and clean way so it doesn't look drab or "dirty."

**Painting Hair in Watercolor**

For painting the hair in watercolor mixtures proceed in the same manner as before. Draw the rectangles shown here on watercolor paper.

Hair textures are not smooth as flesh tones are, so don't use a glazing technique here. Instead, paint one wash of one color on the rectangle, then, while it's still damp, stroke the second pigment into it. It's important not to mix the second color into the first color very much; just stroke it on with a no. 8 pointed brush and leave the brush marks. The streaks give the texture of hair. To accentuate the feeling of hair, leave some areas very light or lift them out with a barely damp brush. If there's a third color indicated, drop it into one area only. It's usually needed to give us a dark, and the dark and the light work together to make a shimmer, like the sheen on hair.

Remember, the less you touch these rectangles with your brush, the more like hair they'll look. Too much tinkering will make them look overworked. When you have four hair rectangles you like, save them for reference.

Painting these mixtures will give you a hands-on understanding of the wonderful way a cool color can help a warm one — if you don't mix them into mud!

Blond

**Blond**

Raw Sienna, Cerulean Blue, Yellow Ochre. This must be kept light and airy. Use the Cerulean Blue judiciously, for yellow and blue will give you green. Pale is the word for the blue.

Brown

**Brown**

Burnt Umber, Cerulean Blue; when dry, a Yellow Ochre wash over parts of this rectangle. The magic of Cerulean Blue comes to the fore once more and keeps the Burnt Umber from being too harsh.

Red

**Red**

Burnt Sienna, Cobalt Blue and a touch of mauve in the darks. You might want to add a light wash of Yellow Ochre to this group too, when dry.

Dark

**Dark**

Burnt Sienna, Ultramarine Blue. The less mixing you do with these two, the better.

###  _Controlling Color in Portraits_

A true colorist does not open all her tubes of brightest color and squeeze them out on the canvas in equal amounts and expect to achieve exciting blazing color in the painting. This doesn't give you brilliance, any more than having all the instruments in the orchestra playing as loudly as possible and all at the same time gives you powerful music.

Dull (low-intensity) colors placed next to bright (high-intensity) colors make the bright colors look brighter. Dark (low-value) colors next to light ones (high-value) make light colors look lighter (see earlier in this chapter).

The distribution of color across your canvas also means so much. Do you want a large amount of bright color with a smaller number of quiet hues? Or would you prefer to reverse this color idea? Do you want the most brilliant color in a necklace, scarf or tie near the face? Or would you want it as a background for your figure? Remember, you are the artist; you are in control.

**Learning From Other Artists**

If color really intrigues you, start looking at the greatest colorists of all time: Matisse, Gauguin, Bonnard and van Gogh. Try looking at reproductions of their work upside down. Only then will you really appreciate the experimental color innovations of these artists. Start keeping a notebook and write down color arrangements that excite you. Anything that forces you to look at paintings in a more analytical way will help you beyond measure.

While you're at it, study the great nudes and figures and portraits by Modigliani. See what he did with all that flesh color in the nudes. Notice the colors he used as complements to the light-value orange he used for flesh color. Also look at the wondrous hues Gauguin used in his paintings of Tahitian women with beautiful dark skin tones.

Oil Portraits From Life

**Portrait Demonstration**

Oil on canvas 14″ × 11″ (36cm × 28cm)

**I** n this chapter we'll progress to an actual portrait painting in oil, the medium of the masters. The many reasons for the continued popularity of this medium can be reduced to one attribute: its versatility. Oil is not an easy medium to master, but it will give you more than any other coloring process.

You can build an impasto by laying oil on thickly, or you can drag one color across another color and get a unique broken color effect. Oil paint can be as delicate as a butterfly wing, with one veil of color thinly glazed over another. You can draw with it, glaze with it, knife it on, get the best rich, transparent darks and the airiest, sunniest lights.

In this section we'll examine three oil painting techniques: a monochrome portrait, an alla prima wet-into-wet approach, and a built-up, or glazed, technique. In each one we will be working with a live model. Perhaps you can get a friend or family member to pose for you.

###  _Working in Monochrome_

**Highlands Fisherman**

Oil on panel 20″ × 16″ (51cm × 41cm) Collection of artist

You don't have to paint with many colors to do a good portrait. The portrait here was done with just Raw Umber and Titanium White, retouch varnish and turpentine. This varnish is thin and watery and dries hard very quickly. You can draw fine lines with it and paint over them almost immediately without smearing them.

Highlands is a seashore community near my home, and this gentleman has retired from fishing after spending years at sea. You will seldom see more character in a face than in that of this gentle, introspective man; he was still proud enough to come to pose for our group in a shirt, tie, and overcoat rather than his working clothes.

This painting started out to be a full-color portrait, but I liked the effect so much I decided to leave it a monochrome.

Use an untempered Masonite panel prepared with two coats of acrylic gesso. Next, thin Raw Umber thinned with turpentine and rub it over the entire panel with a paper towel. This veil of color is called an _imprimatura_. The imprimatura gives the white panel a midtone to paint on so you can work up to the lights and down to the darks, just as you did with charcoal on tinted paper. The imprimatura is quite transparent, allowing the white ground beneath to glow through.

Next, thin Raw Umber with enough retouch varnish to enable it to flow easily and draw the portrait with a soft pointed brush. Use no. 4 and no. 6 bristle brushes to model the drawing and the shadows on this portrait head.

When the Raw Umber halftone and shadow work seem right, look for lights and highlights. Lift out the light areas with a brush and turpentine. Using very stiff white paint, not thinned at all, apply it where you see the lights. Start with the brightest light on the forehead, closest to the light source. Working your way around the head, paint the white on the hair, brow bone, nose, cheekbone, eyelids, lips, chin, and shirt collar.

**Edges**

Notice the whites; they are quite soft where they round the form to the halftones. There's a crisp white edge on the lower lip where highlight meets cast shadow; this edge is curved to tell us the lower lip is a rounded form. The right edge of this highlight white dissolves to a blur, which tends to make the fisherman look as if he might move.

We have not spoken much about edges in our portraits except in the painting of hair; this study will show you that it is wise to keep some of your edges of forms that turn away from you indistinct. Notice the blurs at the back of the head above the ear and on the coat collar.

A portrait in which all edges are hard appears flat, cut-out, and rigid. A portrait in which all edges are soft and blurred is mushy and unresolved. You need both kinds of edges in a realistic portrait.

The head is 9 inches (23cm) high (lifesize). It was done in one sitting in bright artificial light, and no photography was used.

**Edges Hint**

Hard edges advance a form. Soft edges make the form recede. Hard edges indicate solidity and describe a form. Soft edges indicate movement and atmosphere.

###  _Demonstration_

Working Wet-Into-Wet

_Alla prima_ painting is direct painting, working wet-into-wet to arrive at the finished portrait in one sitting. One good point about working wet-into-wet is that the whole painting will have a freshness about it, because it is done all at one sitting, on one day. A possible disadvantage of this technique is that not all of us are good at sloshing around in all that wet paint, and if we are not extremely careful, we get darks in the lights and cools in the warms, and everything in the painting ends up a sort of a midtone gray — very dirty looking. Only with experience do we learn we can scrape off ugly dead colors with a palette knife when they appear, and go in again with fresh, clean color.

In this technique, we use three steps. First, rub in an imprimatura of Raw Sienna thinned with turpentine over the entire primed canvas.

Next, use a brush and the same paint to put in the sketch drawing of the head, which serves as your road map for laying in the full colors and values. Then lay in the transparent colors for the shadows and the opaque colors for the lights, mixed to approximate the colors and values found in the model, side by side like pieces of a mosaic. Follow with the halftones, saving the highlights and dark accents for the end. Keep the minute details and blending of tones to a minimum, since we are striving for a fresh, vigorous portrait that doesn't look labored.

Choose a model with a fair to medium complexion and have her wear a white shirt or blouse. The white clothing will aid your value perception and help you to see that even the lightest skin is a long way from white. The white collar will lend a crispness to the portrait.

**The Imprimatura**

Squeeze out about 1½ inches (38mm) of Raw Sienna at the top of your palette. Add turpentine to some of it to mix a thin solution and scrub it over the canvas with your largest brush or a crumpled paper towel. The imprimatura should be quite strong in color, but with no clumps of paint, just clear and transparent. Don't bother to smooth it out; the more painterly it looks, the better. This heavy ugly color becomes a glowing gold when made transparent. This thin wash will dry quickly.

**Setting Up for the Portrait**

  1. Set the timer for twenty-five minutes, and have the model begin the pose. Pose your model in a good light, seated on a high stool or in a chair on the model stand as you did in the charcoal portraits. The head should be approximately at your eye level. Your canvas is on the easel at the same level as the sitter's head, the easel next to the sitter. If you are right handed you will want the easel and canvas to the right of your sitter; if left handed, place the canvas at the left of the sitter. Select your looking spot and make the masking tape mark on the floor, six paces from the easel, next to the painting table. Do not place the palette on your shadow side; it must be in a good light so that you can judge your color mixtures.

Let the model face into the light, assuming a pose that will allow you to paint a three-quarter view of the head.

  2. Step back. Squint. Visualize the head transposed on the canvas. With your no. 6 filbert, dip into the Raw Sienna — not thinned so much this time, just enough so you can draw with it and it will not run. Try to keep the paint at the tip of the bristles — the paint won't do anything for you if it is pushed up into the ferrule. Also, it will be much harder to clean out later.

Draw an egg shape, not too high or too low on the canvas. Very often the base of the nose is about halfway down the canvas. If the model is looking to the right, be sure there is extra air space on that side for her to look into. Where you place the head on the canvas is of great importance; take your time.

**MATERIALS**

**Surface**

18″ × 24″ (46cm × 61cm) stretched and gessoed canvas or primed canvas board

**Oil Pigments**

Cobalt Blue, Lemon Yellow, Light Red, Raw Sienna, Titanium White, Ultramarine Blue, Venetian Red, Yellow Ochre

**Brushes**

nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 filberts ½-inch (12mm) flat no. 3 round

**Other Supplies**

gum turpentine or odorless paint thinner in a brush washer, easel, disposable paper palette, paper towels, palette knife, hand mirror, kitchen timer, painting table or taboret

Remember the male adult head is approximately 9 inches (23cm) high; the female, 8 inches (20cm). Hold the brush at the end of the handle and draw with your whole arm. (This is the reason the handles on oil painting brushes are so long — to allow more space between you and your canvas.)

**Blocking In the Head in Paint**

Step back. Now hold the brush horizontally and align it with the line of the eyes of the model. Draw this line halfway down the oval or where you see it. Next, draw the center line in the face. This is your framework for the head. Use this method for starting any portrait in any medium: (1) geometric shape of the head; (2) eye line; and (3) vertical center line.

Looking over your shoulder, check the canvas and the model together in the mirror. Does the angle feel right? Add the brow line just above the eye line. Using the brush handle as an indicator, sight and draw the angle of the nose. Make a mark for the base of the nose and another for the mouth. At this point it is easiest to draw the head with straight lines. Add the cylinder of the neck and the general contour of the hair shape. Now you have a diagram of the head, a foundation for a more studied drawing.

If you aren't happy with your start, wipe it off with a dry paper towel (no turpentine) and begin again. Your second or third attempts will be infinitely better — you'll feel freer and the model will have settled into the pose.

Squint and select the most obvious feature. Is it a dark hair shape? A long nose? Chubby cheeks? Whatever you think it is, put it in with firm strokes — emphasize it. You're still working only with Raw Sienna. Stop and take a five-minute break for the model.

**Looking for Darks**

Start to look for shadow shapes. Is there shadow on the side of the face away from the light and under the chin? Alongside the nose? Under it? Look for the side plane and the underplane of the nose and the cast shadow from it. You are changing this flat drawing into a solid three-dimensional form by laying in the shadows.

Put in the eye shapes next (dark ovals now, no whites indicated yet). Then the corners of the mouth and the shadow under the lower lip.

**1 Apply the Imprimatura and Draw the Head**

Tone the canvas with thinned Raw Sienna, applying the paint with a crunched-up paper towel. Then, with this same color, thinned only with turpentine or odorless paint thinner, draw the head with no. 4 and no. 6 filberts.

**Imprimatura Hint**

The colors used here aren't the only colors that can be used for an imprimatura. In future portraits, try Cobalt Blue, Burnt Sienna or Terre Verte; each gives a different effect.

Is the upper lip in shadow? If the light is from above, it often is.

Look for shadow in the hair. If the hair is dark, you may want to lay in the entire hair mass as the shadow value.

Give your figure a collar, making it go around and behind the neck.

**Check Alignment and Proportions**

Hold your brush at arm's length, perfectly perpendicular, elbow locked, to line up the features vertically. Does the corner of the mouth line up under the center of the eye? Does the wing of the nose line up with the tear duct of the eye? If not, where does it fall? Do the shoulders slant? Which way? Can you align the ear with any other part?

You can use the brush handle to check proportions too. Close one eye, and looking at the model, line up the tip of the brush handle with the eye line. Move your thumb up to a point on the handle where you sight the chin line. Now, using this as a measure-ment, check to see if the distance from the eye line to the top of the head is the same. If not, how is it different? These relative measurements help solve problems of proportion.

Always try vertical aligning, horizontal aligning, and relative measuring if something appears wrong. It's easy to get a portrait head out of alignment — especially a three-quarter head. Give the model a five-minute rest now.

**Looking for Lights**

Up until now, we have been looking just for darks. Now start looking for light areas on the head and face. Wipe out the light areas with a dry paper towel wrapped around your finger. If you can't get them clean enough, use a brush dampened with turpentine. Try not to confuse the lights with the darks. The head is either light where the light is striking it or dark where it's not. Don't allow lights to sneak into your darks, or darks into your lights. Keep it simple for now; there's plenty of time for subtlety later.

**Suggesting Background**

Think about your background. Even when using just Raw Sienna, you can darken the background next to the light edge of the face or collar to throw the head into relief. Check your painting in the mirror; even in monochrome it should have some resemblance to the model now.

Stop for five minutes and let the model rest. Use the time to set out your colors: Titanium White, Light Red and Cobalt Blue.

**2 Add Opaque Color to the Face and Hair**

The Raw Sienna imprimatura is still visible as the background color in the lower third of the face and in the neck and teeth. Lay in an opaque flesh tone of Titanium White, Raw Sienna and Venetian Red on the forehead band. Apply the same hue slightly darker and more rosy in the cheek-nose-ear band.

Although Linn's hair is an outstanding feature of her appearance, I decided to put one section of it behind her shoulder to avoid two long, very similar dark shapes that would dominate the entire portrait.

**Shadows in Color**

Reset the timer for twenty-five minutes and have the model resume the pose. For the shadow areas on the head and neck, mix Raw Sienna and Light Red without white. I know this is warmer than you think it should be, but if the shadow color is too cool, the head will lack life; if it's too hot, it's simple to cool later. Paint all the shadow areas the same color and value: dark ovals for the eyes, along the side of the face and hair (observe carefully the contour where the shadow meets the light), under the nose, the upper lip, under the lower lip, under the chin, the shadow cast upon the neck. Apply it thinly, allowing the Raw Sienna imprimatura to show through.

**Painting the Lights**

With a full brush, lay in the lightest brightest white in the painting on the collar where the light strikes it. This will be a guide for your flesh tones; the complexion can never be as light as this white.

Step back and study the model, this time for color. With your knife, mix a small quantity of the color you see on the forehead — perhaps Titanium White and Raw Sienna. With the tip of the knife, paint an area about 1 inch (25mm) in diameter on the canvas in its proper place and check the color. (You cannot really judge the hue until you see it on the canvas and next to the model. It looks quite different there from the way it looks on the palette.) This will be our lightest light on the head.

**Placing the Flesh Tones**

Work in the light areas; try to place the correct color and value in the correct place, as if the head were a jigsaw puzzle of painted tones. Remember the rule:three values in the light and one in the shadow.

**3 Observe Changing Light and Define the Features**

I took a break after some morning work and then resumed painting in the afternoon. Though I started painting this portrait in the morning with the light coming from the left, the light has shifted to afternoon light, stronger and lower, coming from the right. This is a good way to get into trouble on a portrait, changing light directions. The effect of light coming from two sources is visible here.

Begin to define the features. Trim down her shoulder (it is easy to paint it the wrong size when only one shoulder is visible). Add cool flesh tones of Titanium White, Yellow Ochre, Venetian Red and a touch of Cobalt Blue to the receding side planes of the face, jaw and neck. I decided a gold earring would be an asset. I wanted to break up the hair mass.

If your model has a fair complexion, try for value 2 light at the forehead band, value 3 mid-light at the nose-cheekear band, and value 4 midtone at the chin and jaw band. The shadow would be value 5½.

Look for muted golds in the forehead, warmer rosy nose, cheeks and ear, cooler colors at the jaw areas. Between colors wipe the brush or rinse it and squeeze out the turpentine — you want nothing but paint on the brush! Don't try to blend the colors on the canvas now; just place each one next to the other as you see variations within the flesh tone occur. Don't forget, nostrils, mouth, ears — all openings in the head — are warm. Take a five minute break for the model.

**The Background**

When the model resumes the pose, decide on your background color. Mix it up and paint it in boldly with a large brush, covering the outer edges of the hair silhouette. The background should be a midtone: darker than your light areas, lighter than your dark areas, and the color should enhance your subject's coloring and clothing. Define the shape of the face by painting the background up to the boundary of the cheek, the jaw, the neck, wherever the background and flesh coincide. Also paint the background out to all four sides of the canvas.

**4 Paint the Background, Fix the Lighting and Continue Refining**

Add broken color suggesting sunlight in the background, laying it in mostly with the palette knife. The colors are Titanium White, Lemon Yellow, Cobalt Blue and Ultramarine Blue. Try to achieve a balance of cool and warm colors throughout the portrait. The hair mass needs to be broken up further. Every part of the portrait has been advanced: features, hair, neck, background and clothing. The light is back again on the left (after a good deal of effort), with just a back light on the right to brighten the hair and add air and light. Even though the mouth is quite defined, it is still soft.

**Hint**

The basic rule of oil painting is opaque lights and transparent shadows. Don't thin the paint with turpentine; just lay it on less heavily and scrub it out more.

**The Hair**

Now study the model and mix two or three values for the hair: a light and a dark, or a light, midtone, and dark, depending on the color of the hair. Treat the hair as a mass first, working from midtone both up to the lights and down to the darks. You can emphasize the hair texture in two ways: by making the hair edges soft, blending them into the background (wet paint) in some places; and by indicating with a smaller brush the direction of the hair, whether straight or curly, and the shine on it. But don't attempt to show each hair on the head.

**Painting the Features**

With the lights, shadows, halftones, hair, and background in, it's a simple matter to slide the features into their proper places.

Using the light tone of the hair, lay in the eyebrow, perhaps breaking the stroke where the light strikes the bone. Using a no. 2 filbert bristle, lay in the line of the upper lid with a midtone warm brown, and pull the color down to define the iris of the eye. Put in the gray of the whites of the eyes. Touch the iris with the specific eye color of the model. If you aren't sure what it is, step up and study the color at close range. Usually it takes only a bit of blue in your midtone color to make the eyes read as blue from a distance. Light eyes are difficult. If you paint them very light, they appear to be sightless. You may have to paint a darker line around the iris. Soften the eyelid line to become the shadow it casts upon the eyeball. Put in the dark pupil. Paint the shadow under the lower eyelid, under the brow or wherever you see it defining the eye socket. Especially important is the shadow between the tear duct (pink) and the nose bridge. This shadow is often bluish.

Changing to a lighter, warmer color, define the nose. There's quite a light color on the side plane of the nose on the light side; it's slightly darker on the shadow side. Define the ball of the nose and the flare of the wings over the nostrils. Paint the underplane, including the nostrils, slightly darker than the shadow, but warmer. Blend this with the shadow the nose casts upon the cheek or above the mouth.

Travel down to the indentation between the nose and the center of the upper lip with the midtone color (not so warm), then go on to the extremely subtle modeling around the mouth, the "muzzle" area. The corners of the mouth are warm darks. The lip color is white with Light Red; the lower lip is considerably lighter than the upper lip in shadow. The line between the lips is broken and warm. Then put in the cool olive green shadow beneath the lower lip.

Define the chin with more orange and less rosy hues. Paint the cool side planes of the face going back to the ears or into the hair. Then the warm cheekbones and warm ears.

**Refining Lights**

Now go back in with lights. Add light on the brow bone, then the upper eyelid as it rounds itself over the eyeball. Place light on the top edge of the lower lid, the bridge of the nose, and the cheekbone. Place that important shine, the highlight, on the ball of the nose. Is there a light on the boundary of the upper lip? Shine on the lower lip, the chin, the hair? Paint the tiny highlight in the eyes with Titanium White and a no. 3 round. None of the other highlights are white; all are tints of flesh tone. Sometimes they have a bit of yellow in them, sometimes a bit of blue.

**Refining Accents**

Now go back and "hit" the brow, eyes, nose, mouth, hair, or ears, wherever you think some part should be darker or more pronounced. Remember, sharp edges advance, soft edges recede. Make the defining strokes on the ball of the nose crisp.

Check everything in the mirror. Is there a reflected light under the chin or the nose? It can be cool and bluish on the chin or jaw, but keep it warm on the nose. Also add highlights and accents to the clothing.

**Finishing Up**

How do the flesh tones look? Are they too cool? If so, carefully add a bit more Light Red with a clean dry no. 6 filbert, particularly on the boundary between the light flesh and the shadow at the cheek. Add it pure to the wet paint already on the canvas. If the tones are too warm, add a little Cobalt Blue using a very light touch — not enough to make the flesh look blue, just a hint to cool it. At this time just work back and forth between the lights, midtones and darks, warms and cools, until the portrait suits you. But be forewarned: This is an easy time to lose the likeness. You are working so intently on the parts you may lose a sense of the whole. You can get it back, but it takes some effort.

Now put the portrait aside and don't look at it until tomorrow. You can make any corrections you feel necessary then. You should have completed this portrait in two and a half to three hours, though it may take a bit longer if you're new at it.

**5 Refine the Background and the Features**

This is the third sitting. To make a better painting, calm down the razzle dazzle of the background. Play down the action in the hair everywhere except where it surrounds the face. Add strong darks in the hair for more contrast with the fair skin and add more lights to "open up" the face. Make the earrings more delicate and add the simple gold chain and medallion. Retain the expression in the eyes while making the eyes lighter in color. Perfect the brows and teeth. Linn's fair complexion is glowing now.

The true Linn is portrayed to the best of my ability. This portrait was done from life. No photography was used.

###  _Exercise_

Painting the Features in Oil

Paint all the steps for the eyes, nose and mouth over a Raw Sienna imprimatura on primed linen canvas. Use nos. 2 and 4 filbert bristles, along with a no. 3 sabeline. I used Titanium White, Raw Sienna, Venetian Red and Cobalt Blue — combination _b_ on the Flesh Color Families in Oils chart in chapter seven. Because I could not get the warmth I wanted from these colors, I added Cadmium Orange and Cadmium Red Light to the palette, along with some oil painting medium to make the paints flow more easily.

**Eye**

**1** Block in the eye oval, the eyebrow and a hint of shadow under the eye and alongside the nose with Raw Sienna.

**2** Draw the brow and eye more carefully with Raw Sienna and oil painting medium and lift out some of the lights with a small brush and turpentine. The imprimatura should be applied a day in advance and thoroughly dry, so when you lift color, the warm tone is revealed rather than the white canvas.

**3** Add flesh color with Titanium White, Raw Sienna and Venetian Red on the forehead and around the eye. Add Cobalt Blue to cool the shadow areas. Mix all four pigments to make a gray for the white of the eye. Make the same mixture without Titanium White to create a dark for the eyebrow, iris, and more eye and lid definition. Add just a touch of Cadmium Orange and Cadmium Red Light to make the eye opening warmer.

**4** Treat the eyebrow in a broken, rough-brushed way with light and dark accents to create the texture of short, crisp hairs. There is a value change as the brow curves over the brow bone. The lines around the eye are soft, not brittle. The darkest — the pupil and the upper third of the iris — lies next to the lightest light, the pure white highlight. The contrast between the white of the eye on the light side and the green-brown of the iris gives the image snap and draws your attention. A tiny bit of Cadmium Orange and Cadmium Red Light warm up the eye and give it more life.

**Nose**

**1** Block in the nose with Raw Sienna. The keystone area is dark, as the brows nearly meet there in the shadow.

**2** Indicate more crisp definition at the nose bridge, and soften lines.

**3** Paint a warm flesh mix of Titanium White, Raw Sienna and Venetian Red with a no. 2 filbert bristle. Add Cobalt Blue to the shadow near the inner corner of the eye, and brush in pure Venetian Red on the top plane of the nose. Add some Cadmium Orange to the flesh areas to make the color clearer.

**4** Emphasize the construction of the nose. Add the contrast of highlights and darker shadows to make the nose appear to project from the face. Paint an orange-red mix in the nostrils, in the reflected light around the left nostril and under the nose in the shadows.

**Mouth**

**1** Use Raw Sienna to block in the forms: the indentation from the nose down to the lips, the upper lip in shadow, and the shadow areas around the mouth and under the lower lip, leaving the lower lip light.

**2** Soften the edges and refine the shapes. Place some darker accents at the corners of the mouth and at one spot between the lips. Please note that you should not draw a line between the lips.

**3** Paint flesh colors around the mouth and into the lip areas, then paint Venetian Red over the lips. Develop the chin. In some places the pale gold of the imprimatura glows through and makes the skin look luminous.

**4** Add Cadmium Orange at the cheek and on the lips and chin for warmth. Place warm shadows under the nose and around the lips on the shadow side. Add Cobalt Blue to cool the mustache area and the shadows on the chin. Warm the lip area in the light with short broken strokes of Venetian Red. Use the same strokes for the nearly white highlight there. Use the lightest of flesh tones for highlights above the lips and under the right corner of the mouth. Use the last stroke to paint the broken line between the lips with a warm dark. Paint it very delicately.

###  _Glazing Technique_

Glazing allows us to build our portrait in stages. The best point about the glazing technique is that it gives us more control. If you don't like the way the paint is going on during the second sitting you can always lift it off, and the underpainting will still be there. A bad point of this more studied technique is that the portrait can become dead and lifeless with too much overpainting. Corrections can be made, of course, but a light touch is best.

**Procedure**

Use the first sitting to create a careful monochrome drawing on a thoroughly dry imprimatura. Dilute the paint for drawing with a little retouch varnish and turpentine. Retouch varnish dries quickly and allows you to make a more finished and detailed drawing. This drawing dries hard and will not lift.

Start applying color in the second sitting. Lay in colors in the lights with a good bit of paint on the brush, using crisp strokes, side by side and one over the other, with a minimum of blending. Stay away from the shadow areas as long as possible, allowing the original shadow color, Raw Umber, to remain visible. When the lights, halftones, and dark accents are in and the background is covered, scumble a thin application of color over the shadows where necessary.

There is plenty of time to correct the parts you don't like and to reinforce the areas you do like. Refine the details of the eyes, the nose, the mouth and the expression. Get nuances of color by laying one hue over another or by breaking your strokes so the undercolor peeks through.

**Varnishing**

After six months, you can varnish the painting. Dilute picture varnish half and half with gum turpentine so the painting won't be too glossy when it dries. Lay it on a flat surface and apply the tinned varnish with a new 2-inch (51mm) foam rubber brush. Work in a warm room, and stroke on the thinned varnish from left to right without hurrying. Use a full brush, overlapping strokes so they touch and leave no dry streaks. If you shake the varnish or stir it too much or stroke it on too fast you'll get bubbles. If this happens, leave the varnish for an hour or so until the bubbles disappear. Once you make the stroke, don't go back into it. Keep moving slowly across the canvas or panel until it's covered. Leave the painting flat in a dust-free room overnight. Picture varnish is available in spray cans, but it has a tendency to drip and form dribbles on the painting unless you're very careful or experienced with spray painting. It is also harder to get an even coating over the whole surface.

This may sound like a lot of trouble, but it really isn't. It's better to know how to varnish your own paintings than entrust the job to someone else. All oil paintings should be varnished for two reasons: (1) to even out the dull and shiny patches that may occur but become visible only after the painting is totally dry; and (2) for protection from dust and dirt.

**Glazing Benefits**

The best reason for using the glazing method is that you can make the portrait any size you want. The Huber portrait seen here (and on pages 7–8) was painted with this glazing technique on canvas. This portait is 40″ × 56″ (102cm × 142cm).

##  _Painting Watercolor_   
Portraits From Life

**Portrait Demonstration**

Watercolor on 140-lb. (300gsm) cold press 14″ × 11″ (36cm × 28cm)

**A** portrait painted in watercolor can have a special clarity, a spontaneity and charm unique to this medium. Most portrait painters never even try watercolor for a portrait because of the great myth that says, "When you paint in watercolor it is down for good; you can't change it." To some degree this is true: you can't lift the entire head from the paper and you can't change a profile to a front view. But you can make numerous alterations on a watercolor portrait if you use colors that don't stain.

In this chapter we'll cover two techniques, both of which allow for change as the work develops, so necessary for any portrait. You may even want to use watercolor for preliminary sketches for a portrait in oil. At any rate, try to develop some fluency in this medium. Watercolor is like tennis — you have to do a lot of it, and do it almost daily. It is by far the most exciting medium, for, by its very nature, it is fluid. Some previous experience with watercolor will be of great help in preparing you for these portrait techniques.

###  _Demonstration_

Lifting-Out Technique

The idea behind this technique is to get enough color on the cold-press illustration board so that the lights and highlights can be lifted with a damp brush or sponge, thereby allowing you to model the head with a complete range of values. Use only transparent, non-staining pigments, with no white. You'll achieve the lights by lifting more and more pigments off in smaller and smaller areas, allowing the white surface of the board to show through. This way, you can develop forms with considerable subtlety.

This is no runaway quick technique for watercolor but rather one that offers maximum control in every respect. Color can be built up to considerable richness, too.

Illustration board (which is nothing more than paper mounted on cardboard) is relatively rigid and has a harder surface than watercolor paper. The paper surface really matters for this technique because it is dampened again and again by the lifting brush or cosmetic sponge, and some papers can't take this kind of abuse. Crescent coldpress board, however, has enough tooth to hold the watercolor and its surface allows you to work on it indefinitely (within reason).

**Procedure**

Make a careful drawing of the model using a standard no. 2 pencil and a kneaded eraser. Apply flesh tones and hair and clothing colors in mid-light values over all the forms without having to think about leaving white paper for the lights and highlights. Add halftones and even shadows, allowing them to dry. Use a barely damp, clean sponge to begin the modeling in a lifting action, pulling out the lights from the midtones and mid-lights. Add color with a barely damp brush, using a dry-brush manner. When the larger forms begin to feel solid, add the features. Place dark accents, and lift out lights and highlights on smaller forms with water on a no. 3 round and blot with a tissue. Soften or sharpen edges with the large brush, adding variation and interest to the portrait. Give the background a light wash or leave clean, white paper.

A watercolor portrait in this technique can be strong and dramatic. The model should wear vivid colors. The silhouette of the head, hair, shoulders, and maybe arms or hands should make an interesting pattern, particularly if it is going to stand out from a white or very light background. Allow two sittings of two hours each.

**Setting Up for the Portrait**

Pose the model in daylight, if possible, with the light coming from one source, such as a window. If it's a dark day and you aren't getting enough light to work by, you can use a clip-on utility light with a reflector, or a photographer's spot on a stand. A 200-watt bulb is fine. Just remember to place this auxiliary light at the window, as if the artificial daylight were coming from the same direction as the natural daylight. We're trying to avoid crossed lights. Set out the colors on your palette and spray them lightly with water.

Set the timer for twenty-five minutes and have the model sit on a high stool or on a chair in this light. Pick up your pencil and sketchbook and walk around the model looking for interesting angles and portrait ideas. Get into the habit of doing four or more thumbnail sketches before you begin the actual pose. This will loosen you up, relax the model, and help you decide how to portray the sitter. Choose the best pose or picture possibility from your sketches, allowing your model to have a voice in this decision if you wish. Don't choose anything too contrived or complex when trying out a new technique, though.

**MATERIALS**

**Surface**

40″ × 30″ (102cm × 76cm) good quality cold-press illustration board

**Watercolor Pigments**

Brown Madder, Cobalt Blue, Raw Sienna, Yellow Ochre

**Brushes**

1-inch (25mm) flat nos. 3, 8 rounds

**Other Supplies**

drawing board (slightly larger than the illustration board), practice paper, palette, no. 2 pencil, kneaded eraser, water (a pint or more in a wide-mouthed container), paper towels or tissues, natural sponge, masking tape or clamps, spray bottle, hand mirror, easel, kitchen timer, razor blade

Stop and rest for five minutes. During the break, set out the colors on your palette. Start with a limited palette of three colors for flesh tones and hair: Raw Sienna, Brown Madder, and Cobalt Blue, at least a ½ inch (12mm) of each color. Spray the paints lightly with water now to give them time to absorb the water while you're drawing. It's even better if you wet them down the night before. Never use little hard rocks of color. Watercolor must be moist to behave well.

**Drawing the Head**

Model resumes pose. With a pencil, lightly block in the head close to life-size, visualizing the head as a large geometric form — an egg? A block? Perhaps a combination of both. Look for the cylinder of the neck, and put in the collar, then the shoulders. Place the horizontal eye line and vertical center line on the face next. Block in the ear if it's visible. If you see both ears, or eyes, draw them both at the same time. Squint and look for the boundaries where the light and shadow on the head meet; lightly draw them. This will help you place the features later.

Holding the pencil at arm's length loosely draw in the features and the shape of the hair. Using vertical aligning, horizontal aligning, and relative measuring, plus the mirror, correct your drawing with the kneaded eraser until it satisfies you. Keep your pencil line light. If you make little grooves in the paper, the paint will settle in them later.

When you're satisfied with the drawing, sweep your kneaded eraser from side to side across the drawing, taking out about half of the pencil line. Do not erase up and down on the line for it will only smear it, but across the lines, leaving a broken-line drawing to help you place the color. (If we leave all of the construction lines, they will show through the transparent watercolor washes and spoil the portrait.)

This is probably the end of your second work period. It takes at least two, sometimes three, to get the drawing accurate. Don't hurry. Take the time you need for this important beginning.

1 **Block In the Figure and Chair**

Block in the figure with pencil on a sheet of illustration board. Searching for geometric forms, draw the construction lines of the head. Try for a strong, solid large-scale look. Treat the wrist as a block. Draw the index finger of the right hand completely, even though the letter he is holding will partially obscure it. Draw the body, then draw the clothing over it. Indicate the abstract shape of the chair.

2 **Refine the Drawing**

Refine all the forms: the head, the features, the arm and hands, the shirt. Use vertical aligning, horizontal aligning, relative measuring, and the mirror to bring the drawing to this stage. Draw lines of demarcation between light and shadow areas on forms. Try not to draw too tightly or with heavy black lines, so that you can make improvement when you've overlaid the paint. Erase lines across the forms with the kneaded eraser before beginning painting.

**Starting With Color**

I recommend that you do the pencil drawing with the watercolor board upright on your easel for minimum distortion. You can leave it there when you begin to paint and catch the drips and runs, as I do. Don't work completely flat on a table; the paint just won't act the same.

These pigments — Raw Sienna, Brown Madder, and Cobalt Blue — are a dark yellow, muted red and clear blue. The Brown Madder and Raw Sienna will provide the warm you need and the Cobalt Blue will cool them. Without the blue, your portrait would look as if a very sunburned model had posed for you.

When the model resumes the pose, study the flesh color and mix up a fairly light wash to resemble its general color. Raw Sienna is a very good base color to start, then add a bit of Brown Madder to warm it. With your largest brush, paint it over the whole head — face, neck, hair — quickly. Don't worry if it drips; blot it with a paper towel. Lay the wash on from top to bottom or side to side, but don't go back into it while it's wet. No matter what streaks or blobs or bubbles you have, leave it alone and let it dry undisturbed. If the color goes where you don't want it, mop it up with a paper towel, using the outside edges of the head shape.

When working with watercolor remember that it's always possible to lay one wash over another to make an area smoother or darker, to change its hue, or for any other reason — but only after the first wash is dry. It is easiest to work light in the early stages, then see how dark you need to go later for the eye areas, shadows, and so on.

3 **Apply the First and Second Washes**

Using a 1-inch (25mm) flat, paint the first flesh tone wash of a mixture of Raw Sienna and Brown Madder on the head and hands and let it dry. Mix the same colors to a darker value and paint in the second wash, working around the areas where the flesh is light and leaving those parts untouched. Leave it to dry.

**Shadows and Mid-Darks**

Now mix up the second wash, the shadow wash, with the same colors (Brown Madder and Raw Sienna) but using less water so it's darker. Decide on the value by studying the model and squinting. For this shadow lay-in, all the shadows are the same color and value. On the value scale of 1 to 7, if the flesh tone in light is a value 2, the shadow is value 5, mid-dark. This is easy to say, but difficult to do. It's hard to get the values accurate in watercolor because the wash always dries lighter than it was when wet. About all you can do is to proceed with clean washes, one at a time, allowing each one to dry, always with the option of adding a second or a third wash when the portrait is nearly finished to get the values as deep as you want them.

With your large brush, lay in this warm, dark wash over the first wash wherever you see shadow, loosely defining the shapes of the forms — for instance, the eye oval, beneath the cheekbone, under the nose, perhaps the side plane of the nose, the upper lip, under the chin, within the ear, beneath the ear lobe. Paint hair shadows in this dark flesh color too, if the hair is darker.

Leave the first wash as is in the light areas. You don't want to cover the lights with shadow. Lay this shadow wash in quickly so you don't disturb the first wash and let it dry.

When the head is dry, lay a Cobalt Blue wash over the shadow areas to cool them and diminish their intensity.

Now, paint some of the midtones and darks in the clothing. Lay out the colors on the palette and spray them with water.

**The Hair**

Decide what color the hair is. (Refer to chapter seven if you need help with this.) Lay in a proper middle value for the hair, and then drop in the darks. Let it dry. Wet the brush, squeeze it out, and with this barely damp brush lift out the lights and soften some of the edges where the hair meets the skin. Remember, hair has a very different texture from that of skin and should have some soft edges. You don't want it to look like a wig.

**The Background**

Choose a color for the background and decide where it will be. Will it cover the entire board out to the edges? If you want to leave it white paper, clean up the edges of the head and body silhouette with a sponge.

You can lay a very pale wash over the background (or you could even have tinted the entire illustration board before you began the drawing). After you choose a color, mix quite a large amount of it. You might try a soft neutral green made from Raw Sienna and Cobalt Blue. (Greens and blues, cool colors, enhance the warmth of flesh tones.) Lay this wash in with the large brush, up to and overlapping the hair edges. When it's dry, soften some of the hair edges with a clean, barely damp brush. (Some painters call this a "thirsty brush."It lets you move paint around without adding any water to the surface.) When the background is dry, take the damp brush and pick up some fairly dry hair color from the palette. Split the hairs of the brush by spreading them like a fan with your fingers, and drag a few of these dry-brush strokes over the hair edges in places. This will give you another hair texture — fine lines — in addition to the soft edges of the hair mass.

Stop and allow a five minute rest for the model. Change the paint water. For painting flesh, the paint water must be clean. With tissues or paper towels, make a clean area on your palette for mixing flesh tones.

**Preparing for the Features**

When your model resumes the pose, set the timer for twenty-five minutes.

It's important to stop, think and study the model before you go any further.

Begin to develop the under-construction for the features, the form of the brow, the cheekbones, and the moving muscles around the eyes and mouth. Use a 1-inch (25mm) flat or no. 8 round. Work from midtone to dark.

Always let one wash dry before adding another. If you do this you won't get muddy color. This process is called _glazing_.

Look for the planes of the nose; top, side, and underplane. Perhaps a third wash of Raw Sienna and Brown Madder will define them. To be safe, you could apply one color at a time and not mix them on the palette at all. The nose, cheeks and ear band are warmer than the forehead, so you may need more Brown Madder in that section.

Move down to the neck. Is it darker? Cooler? Does it need another shadow wash? A cool blue wash? The neck can never be as light as the forehead. Remember, let each wash dry before over-painting.

4 **Paint a Third Wash and Paint the Clothing**

Now paint the flesh areas with a darker, cooler color, a mixture of Raw Sienna, Brown Madder and Cobalt Blue. This is a shadow wash. Preserve the mid-light values by working around them and leaving them untouched. We have been building up the flesh tones, layer by layer, allowing each wash to dry before proceeding with the next.

Paint the shirt with three progressively darker values. The jeans are just dark. Paint the watchband, leaving the white of the paper for the silver buckle. Add a gray wash over the letter in the right hand and a brown wash on the hair over the flesh tone. Lay in fourth washes to define the eye socket, the side plane and underplane of the nose, the downplane of the chin, the side planes of the face.

The whole principle of this technique is to get enough mid-light, mid-dark and dark values on the portrait so that you can lift the lights and model the facial forms. This is the end of the first sitting.

**Lifting Out the Lights**

Change the paint water. Then, squinting hard, decide where the lightest light is — usually on the forehead. Take a clean, damp sponge and lift out this light area from the flesh tone. Try not to wipe it along or you'll smear the color. If it's still not light enough, rinse the sponge and try again. Repeat until the highlight is the shape and size you want.

Using this lifting process, move on to the next highest light. Is it the cheekbone? Proceed down the face and then to the neck and collar. The lights in the hair can be picked out too. If the sponge is too large for the smaller lights, you can use a brush. Wet the brush and touch just the spot you want to be lighter. Wait a moment, then blot with a clean tissue. Repeat with clean water and clean tissues until you attain the result you want. Just be sure to wash the brush out after every lift, or you will be redepositing the color instead of working your way down to the clean paper surface.

Lifting out with a sponge or brush takes practice, but you'll soon find it quite easy. Since we're using only nonstaining colors, you should not find it difficult to lift them. If the particular area you're working on is getting soggy and the color isn't coming off cleanly, stop and let that part dry. Then you can go back into it with the damp sponge or brush and get better results. You can even scrub lightly with the wet tip of the brush hairs to loosen the particles of pigment before you blot in a particularly stubborn spot. Lifting is the essence of this technique. I am sure you will master it.

**Take a Closer Look at the Features**

Here you can see the texture of this paint on the board and its similarity to the visual texture of skin. Notice the blues in the area from the nose bridge to the eye. The merest suggestion of eyelashes helps direct the gaze. The hazel eyes are nearly lost in shadow, as is the highlight in the eye. More pronounced is the light on the brow bone, the fleshy eyelid, the upper plane of the lower lid, and the shine at the bridge of the nose and below the tear duct. The temple is both warm and cool, one laid over the other. The shadow under the eye is mainly cool. Light is lifted out on the cheekbone, which becomes warm and then abruptly darker as the plane changes on the side of the face. The top plane and side plane of the nose are indicated with warm color; the nostrils are lost in the underplane shadow.

Cools and warms interact in the muscles around the mouth and under the lower lip and chin. You need the cools in these areas, for a mature man has beard there even if he has just shaved. Squint your eyes and observe how the areas of the face step down in value from the light band on the forehead, the mid-light warm nose-cheek-ear band, to the chin and jaw band, which is farthest from the light.

Stop and rest. You've been working for two to two and a half hours. Ideally, it's time to stop for the day.

**The Second Sitting**

Now you can see your portrait with a fresh eye. Set out new colors and spray them lightly with clean water. As you study the model, you may see changes you want to make before you proceed. When you resume work, paint in the eye color in the iris, then paint the upper lid, the shadow cast on the eyeball by the upper lid, and the shadow under the lower lid. Mix your darkest dark and put in the dark pupil. With a fairly dry brush and a light touch, put in the eyebrow. With the warm Brown Madder and perhaps a touch of red or orange, touch in the nostrils, inner corners of the eyes at the tear ducts, ears and mouth. All openings in the head are warm.

Look for the shadow areas in the mouth and paint them. Perhaps the corners of the mouth, then the upper lip. Just remember, in any medium we never outline the mouth. Define the lower lip by laying the shadow beneath it. Add a touch of dull green (Raw Sienna/Cobalt Blue mixture) under the lower lip. If the whites of the eyes are darker than they should be, lighten them by lifting out. Also lift out the highlights you see in the hair.

**Finishing the Portrait**

For the small bright highlights in the eyes, proceed as follows: Dip a no. 3 round in clean water and shake off the excess. Touch the spot where you want the highlight to be, let it sit a moment but don't let it dry, and immediately lift the dot with a clean dry tissue. Don't smear it; just lift it. You will have a clean highlight. If it's not light enough, let it dry and repeat the process. To get a crisp highlight, you can't niggle with it very much.

If the light is not right, lay in the eye color again, let it dry, and proceed once more with a clean water dot. Any small highlight can be attained this way — the light on the edge of the lower eyelid, the light on the lower lip, the highlight on the nose, the sparkle on jewelry.

If you need a brighter highlight in the eye, pick it out with the corner of a razor blade. You get only one chance at this, for you're cutting into the white paper beneath the paint. Keep this highlight small. Carefully decide where you want it, then, with one deft stroke, nick the paper surface. Done!

Continue working this way, adding halftones and shadows, subtracting lights, letting the painting dry between each step until you complete the portrait. Don't forget to check it in the mirror frequently. You can complete a profile in four hours, but it's advisable to split the time into two two-hour work session. After two hours of intense concentration, you're weary and less capable of making the fine judgments of value and color necessary to bring the portrait to a happy conclusion.

**Accents**

These darks can strengthen the portrait and give it life and sparkle. You'll find accents at the corner of the mouth, in the eye, on the hair and under the collar. Placing the darkest accent next to the light (e.g., the highlight in the eye) is a wonderful way to add life to the portrait. Squint and search for these small darks. Just remember, never place the dark accents in the light areas! Lights are lights and darks are darks. Do your best to keep them that way.

Even when the entire head is finished, if it looks too pale or too cool, you can mix a warm colored wash and glaze it over the entire head. If you use your large brush and work quickly, the existing image won't be disturbed. Of course, the painting underneath must be thoroughly dry.

**Watercolor Hints**

  * When working in watercolor, keep it clean. Don't mess around in previously laid wet paint.

  * In these transparent watercolor techniques, the only white is the paper shining through the layers of paint. No white paint is used.

  * Accept the fact that you will be spending more time thinking about what you are going to do next than actually doing it.

5 **Add Final Washes and Details**

Lift some mid-lights from the shirt, carefully leaving the entire shirt darker than the flesh tones so it will read as a dark green. Paint in the cigarette very simply. Lay in a pale Yellow Ochre wash over all the background with the board turned upside down so the paint doesn't run into the figure. Leave the chair form as white paper. When the wash is dry, add a gradated wash of gray to the right of the figure from clear water at the top to more concentrated color near the chair with the board right side up. Add the gray smoke. The smoke travels up and out of the painting as a design element at the top edge. I painted this portrait from life — Dean is my son.

Painting the Features in Watercolor

As these features belong on a man's face, they are painted in stronger shapes and bolder colors than the features of a woman or a child.

The palette consists of a Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake, Cerulean Blue, Cobalt Blue, Burnt Umber, Olive Green.

This is direct painting on Arches 140-lb. (300gsm) cold-pressed watercolor paper.

**Eye**

1 Mix an initial wash of Raw Sienna with Scarlet Lake and paint it over the entire eye area and let it dry. With a mixture of Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake, and a touch of Cerulean Blue to cool the color, paint the eye, eyebrow and structure around the eye opening and let it dry.

2 Strengthen the shadows, brow and structure with a darker mix of these same three colors and let it dry. Lay in the color of the iris. Paint a still darker mix of these three colors at the edge of the upper eyelid running right into the iris. Leave a break in the lid line and leave the highlight in the eye so the initial wash shows. Let it dry.

3 Add Cerulean Blue to cool the area between the bridge of the nose and eye; also over the whites of the eyes. Drop Scarlet Lake into the inner corner of the eye and a bit above while the blue wash is wet. Let it dry. Use a darker warm mix of Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake and Cobalt Blue to define the eyebrow in short strokes and broken lines, and bring this mix down with water over part of the blue area and into the fold line of the lid and definition of the lower lid. Leave the light edge where the lower lid catches the light unpainted. Let it dry.

4 Use accents of Cobalt Blue and Burnt Umber mixed together to define the brow further. Use a darker warm flesh mixture of Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake and Cerulean Blue to cover the fleshy area between the eyebrow and the fold of the eyelid, and further define the lid and the area surrounding the eye opening. Paint the pupil with the darkest dark you can make with Cobalt Blue, Burnt Umber and Scarlet Lake.

**Nose**

1 Apply an initial wash of Raw Sienna and Scarlet Lake over the nose area and let it dry. Using a slightly darker mixture of these same colors, indicate the placement and structure, thinking about the top plane, side planes and underplane. Leave hard edges next to lights for clearer definition. Paint up to the eye, down to the lip, leaving light areas untouched. Let it dry.

2 Further define all forms, still using only Raw Sienna and Scarlet Lake, but darker. Leave lights untouched. Paint a light wash over the top plane where the fleshy ball of the nose begins, and allow it to dry.

3 Add a Cerulean Blue and Cobalt Blue wash at the keystone area where the nose becomes the forehead, at the inner eye area and on the face between nose and lip (the mustache area), and on the far cheek. While wet, add a darker warm wash as in step 2, further defining the nose and far cheek, isolating the lights, and let it dry. Use a stroke of warm dark to indicate the nostril, fleshy wing of the nose, and paint a touch on the eyebrow. Let it dry.

4 With the darkest warm color (a mix of Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake, and a bit of Cerulean Blue), add accents defining the underplane of the nose, pushing against the highlight at the bridge of the nose, hitting the bit of eyebrow and corner of the eye one more time. Paint around highlights on the ball of the nose and at the bridge (they are left the color of the initial wash). You may want one more warm mid-dark wash, and one more blue wash near the eye and on the lip area. Keep fleshy areas of the nose warm.

**Mouth**

1 Apply an initial wash of Raw Sienna and Scarlet Lake all over the mouth area and let it dry. With a mixture of Raw Sienna, Scarlet Lake and a touch of Cerulean Blue, place the mouth by indicating the corners, upper lip and lower lip in a most minimal way. Let it dry.

2 Paint a light wash of Raw Sienna and Scarlet Lake on the upper and lower lips in a broken manner to avoid hard edges around the lips. Leave the light on the lower lip as the first wash.

3 Paint the halftones with a darker mix of Raw Sienna and Scarlet Lake, indicating the structure of the mouth up to the nose and down to the chin. While wet, float in Cerulean Blue on the mustache area and lower chin; paint a stroke of Olive Green under the lower lip. When dry, make more definition of the "muzzle" and chin area with the warm mixture allowing the light areas to remain the light value of the first wash.

4 Add more definition of the muzzle area around the mouth with a Cerulean Blue wash, a warm slightly darker flesh mixture, and an Olive Green wash. Put each wash down and allow it to dry before applying the next. This way you avoid the muddy colors you would get if these warm and cool colors were mixed on the palette or _wet-into-wet_ on the paper. Again, allow the edges of the washes to remain, to show. You'll achieve a more masculine appearance when forms and edges are not smoothed out. Add minimal dark, warm accents at the corners of the mouth and the center of the upper lip and under the lower lip. Do not paint a line between the lips. Add a bit more definition of the chin and far cheek with a deeper flesh tone.

###  _Demonstration_

Direct Painting Method

This technique is freer and less developed than the first. It looks easier and is, in a way, but only after you have had a little more practice painting the head in watercolor. The previous method, lifting, is slower and more precise, which is better when you're first getting started.

On this portrait we'll work on good-quality watercolor paper. Draw the portrait in pencil quite loosely. We're not concerned with detailing the features but are looking for expression and spontaneity.

This style is more interpretive than realistic and utilizes the watercolor medium to its full advantage. Transparency and clean color take precedence over carefully modeled forms. Execute each part in three or four values. Then add accents and lift out a highlight or two to complete the portrait.

**Preliminary Sketches**

Arrange the easel so there is good light on your board; set up your materials and begin the pose. Set the timer for twenty-five minutes.

Begin with at least four thumbnail pencil sketches of the head, 2–3 inches (51mm–76mm) high, in your sketchbook, moving around the model, selecting different views. Find a pose that is comfortable for her and interesting for you.

Stop. Let the model rest for five minutes.

**Block In the Head**

Begin the pose; set the timer. Step back six paces and visualize the head on the paper. Holding the pencil at arm's length, lightly block in the life-size head, thinking about placement on the paper. Reduce the hair mass to an abstract shape. Now draw the neck and the collar passing around behind.

Put in the horizontal and vertical construction lines for placement of the eyes, brows, nose, ears and mouth. Squint and look for the places where light turns into shadow and lightly draw in these boundaries.

**Drawing the Features**

Sketch the features: eye ovals connected to the shapes at the brow bones, the temples, and, at the inside corners, to the bridge of the nose, the keystone and the side planes of the nose. Work down and around the muzzle area, the corners of the mouth, and the line between the lips. Then move to the chin and jaw, then the ears. Refine the hair, the edges where it touches the face, the movement in the hair.

Decide just how much of the ears you can see. Perhaps you will have to draw the hair over them.

Check your drawing in the mirror and correct it. An accurate drawing makes it easier to get a spontaneous feeling later.

**The Flesh Tones**

Study your model's coloring and mix Yellow Ochre with a touch of Scarlet Lake to make the overall flesh tone. (Be careful, Scarlet Lake is a very strong color). With the 1-inch (25mm) flat, paint this wash over the entire head and neck — eyes, hair, and all — quickly. Make this wash in one pass, so be certain you have enough flesh color mixed beforehand. Let it dry.

Now mix a second slightly stronger wash of the same two colors. In another place on your palette, mix a third wash of Yellow Ochre, Scarlet Lake, and a little Cerulean Blue to cool the color and diminish its intensity. Lay the second wash into the midtone areas working broadly, leaving the first wash untouched for the lights. Let it dry.

Timing is essential in watercolor — knowing when to go back into the painting and when to wait. After you paint a passage, look at it from the side. If you see the sheen of the water on the paper, you'll know it's wet and you'll have to wait a bit before going back into it.

**Correcting Flesh Tones**

Study your work. Should the face be more rosy? More golden? Mix another wash and gently lay the correct color over the area.

**MATERIALS**

**Surface**

30″ × 22″ (76cm × 56cm) sheet 140-lb. (300gsm) cold-pressed watercolor paper

**Watercolor Pigments**

Alizarin Crimson, Burnt Sienna, Cerulean Blue, Cobalt Blue, Raw Sienna, Raw Umber, Scarlet Lake, Ultramarine Blue, Yellow Ochre

**Brushes**

1-inch (25mm) flat no. 3 round

**Other Supplies**

drawing board (slightly larger than the watercolor paper), practice paper, palette, no. 2 pencil, kneaded eraser, water (a pint or more in a wide-mouthed container), paper towels or tissues, natural sponge, masking tape or clamps, spray bottle, hand mirror, easel, kitchen timer, split brush for dry brushing

When the face is dry, plan where the third wash, the one with Cerulean Blue in it, should go. It could be the lower third of the face, or the receding planes of the face going back into the hair, or the cooler areas around the mouth. To add more color or a deeper value to only a section of the face, lay a wash of clear water in that area first and while it's still wet, drop in the color. You'll see it spread softly in the wet spot as the water does the work of carrying the color. With this method you will avoid hard edges around the newly added color. Take the board off the easel and tilt it to encourage the color to flow in a particular direction.

At first this may be alarming, but after your tenth watercolor portrait you won't be so nervous when the ochre drips into the blue, the red runs up and over the eye, and a few hundred other things occur that let you know you're out of control. In all honesty, this very unpredictability is in itself why so many artists are fascinated with this elusive medium.

The most discouraging thing that can happen to your watercolor portrait is having your flesh tones look muddy. The foolproof way to avoid mud is to mix the colors on the painting instead of on the palette, and to lay a wash of only one color at a time.

1 **Complete the Drawing**

Search for the grace and softness of this very feminine child named Rebecca. Complete the drawing with repeated curving lines and rounded shapes. Do not indicate shadow boundaries.

This portrait was painted at night in artificial light, including general overhead room illumination plus one spotlight with reflector on a stand with a 200-watt bulb, to the right of Rebecca.

2 **Apply the First Wash**

Lay the first wash of Yellow Ochre and Scarlet Lake over the pencil drawing on the face, neck, part of the hair, the arms and hands. Apply a wash of Yellow Ochre and Alizarin Crimson to the background, leaving the top third white paper. Paint Alizarin Crimson on the blouse, letting it spill over into the jumper where Cerulean Blue mixes with it on the paper.

**The Background**

Decide what you want to do with the background. Choose one that will set off the sitter's hair and complexion. You can gain harmony of color if you use the colors of the head in the background; just mix them in different proportions. More Yellow Ochre and Cerulean Blue will produce a muted green; Scarlet Lake and Cerulean Blue, a violet. You have great latitude here for again you have varieties of the three primaries, yellow, red and blue.

Mix up plenty of paint and lay it on all around the head and shoulders, and even into the drawing, so the hair, costume or complexion overlaps the background in some places and doesn't just meet it with a hard edge. Plan on the background color going out to the edge of the paper in at least one place so the head is not surrounded by a halo of color surrounded by white paper. If you want color variation within the background, drop another color into it while wet and let it blend as it will.

**The Hair**

Mix a wash that approximates the middle value and general color of the hair (not the highlight or the shadow). With the 1-inch (25mm) flat, lay it over the hair area, working around the highlights so your initial flesh wash serves as the highlights. If the edges of the hair are too hard, soften them with a barely damp clean brush after the paint has dried. Stop and rest five minutes.

**The Features**

Thinking in terms of planes of light and shadow, develop the features. I always think the easiest place to start is with the eyebrows. You can paint them drybrush if you like — with a squeezed-out and split brush. Leave a light area, however small, where the light hits the brow bone. Add the iris in both eyes, leaving a highlight if you can; then the dark pupil. Then do the shadow under the upper lid and lower lid, leaving the top plane of the lower lid light.

You may not have to do much for the nose. Paint the halftone alongside it, the shadow under the nose, and warm nostrils if you see them. To define the ball of the nose you may have to add some warm color there; while doing this, try to leave the highlight on the nose light. Then put in the local color of the upper lip, then the lower lip, trying hard to work around the highlight on it. Do you see the cool shadow under the lower lip? Reread earlier sections of the book if you need to refresh your memory about the forms of the features. Keep your color warm when working on the curves of the ears.

3 **Apply the Second Wash**

Lay in a second wash on the flesh area and begin to define the features, some shadow areas in the hair, and the cast shadow on the neck. A second wash also goes in on the hair, chair, blouse and jumper.

**The Neck, Shadows and Reflected Lights**

The neck is usually cooler, so wash in a tone with a touch more blue or green there. As the cheek turns away from the light, you may see a reflected light bouncing up on the jaw or under the chin. Is it warm or cool? Try not to allow this area to be as light as areas in the light, for it is still within the shadows. Sometimes there is stronger color in this reflected light — it may be quite orange — which lends a decided glow to the face.

**Clothing**

If the costume requires it, you may want to use some of the other colors here. Use the same method as for the head: Brush a light wash over the entire mass and let it dry. Then lay in a darker wash where needed. If the clothing is white, leave the white paper showing and try clear Cerulean Blue for the shadows. This gives an immaculately clean look to your whites.

**Accents**

You will surely need dark accents in the hair, eyes, corners of the mouth, and under the collar. Look for them, and check it all in the mirror.

**Highlights**

In this technique, we didn't lift out the lights as before, but instead planned them before we painted and then worked around them. However, if there are one or two areas where paint covered a highlight inadvertently, of course you can lift it out with a no. 3 round and a dot of water. Use this same procedure for the highlights in the eyes, if they aren't bright enough. If you want them very white, you can always tick them out with the corner of a razor blade.

This entire procedure should have taken about two and a half hours. Face the painting to the wall until tomorrow. Only then will you be able to decide if you are finished or if you want to do more. This technique loses its freshness if you make many corrections, but after you spoil a few watercolors, you'll learn how much you can alter without totally destroying the piece. In watercolor, it is often better to lay the first painting aside and do another than to try to make corrections, using what you learned from the first attempt to achieve a better result the next time.

4 **Develop the Face**

Paint a slightly more subtle flesh color of Yellow Ochre and Alizarin Crimson on the face, making the facial forms more evident. Develop the hair in Raw Umber and Cerulean Blue with a free and rhythmic movement of the brush. Leave lights in the hair as is. For the blue of the eyes, drop in Cerulean Blue with a touch of Raw Sienna, leaving the highlight the pale flesh tone of the first wash. The eyes are cooler than the dress. Develop the beginnings of the nose, eyes and mouth forms.

5 **Add the Finishing Touches**

Add a Burnt Sienna and Cobalt Blue wash to the chair, cooler where the shadow meets the shoulder and sleeve. The very long vertical of the chair back must be broken up. The color varies from warm to cool, with mid-dark at the top to light, to mid-tone, to cool, to very loose splashes of color on the chair seat.

Add a bit more Raw Sienna and some Burnt Sienna and Cobalt Blue to the hair. Lift out some lights in the hair that were covered with paint using a sponge. (The sponge leaves a very soft edge.) Lift some light streaks on the bangs on the forehead with a damp brush. Add dark warm accents to the hair in places.

Develop the facial forms and the cheeks with warm flesh-tone washes, leaving the highlights as the first wash. Add side planes of the nose, and round the ball of the nose. Touch some cool color between the inner corners of the eyes and the bridge of the nose, on the shadow side of the nose, and around the mouth.

Paint the eyelid line with a blue and brown mid-dark. Outline the iris with the same colors; add the pupil with Burnt Sienna, Ultramarine Blue, and Alizarin Crimson, dark. Warm marks at the tear ducts are Burnt Sienna and Scarlet Lake.

Paint the smile line on the cheek only slightly darker than the darkest flesh wash. Put in the parted lips very loosely with broken strokes of rosy flesh tone. Leave the teeth area as the first wash. Deeper warm (Alizarin Crimson and Burnt Sienna) accents define the smile.

Add pale blue washes to the lower sleeve areas to tie the sleeves to the dress visually. Add pure Alizarin Crimson for the ribbon bow, also broken into light spots on the long lengths.

The orange of the flower center picks up the facial and hair colors, allowing your eye to travel back and forth without detracting from the head. The tiny strokes of green stem are a pleasant color note, a cool.

**Spontaneous, Unposed Portrait**

_Hard Hats_ is not, of course, a commissioned portrait. It's a "group portrait" I painted to enter exhibitions and competitive shows where a commissioned portrait would not be acceptable.

I saw these fellows on their lunch break sitting in front of the window of a bank on the corner of a busy intersection in New York City. They were ironworkers constructing a new skyscraper just across the street. It was fortunate that I had my camera around my neck ready to shoot. I asked them if I could take their picture and they smiled and I quickly snapped the shutter. As soon as I saw the developed photograph, I knew I had to paint it, although this whole idea was a new departure for me.

This painting is included here to help you to realize another way of using your portrait painting skills; the possibilities are endless. Working from a candid photograph, the thinking and planning about what to leave out is the most important part. The dark of the window is as dark as I could get it; I used Ultramarine Blue and Burnt Sienna intermixed mostly on the paper rather than on the palette, as it seems to stay darker that way. The remaining values are keyed to the midtone shadow value on the ledge and the wall, which actually appeared much darker. In the photograph these cast shadows were black. I simplified the figures considerably.

## Acknowledgments

Here we are, twenty years later, with a revised and updated version of the original _How To Paint Living Portraits_!

Indeed, I am a lot older, maybe even wiser, and my techniques have developed with the years of experience I have had since the original book was published. I have gained more confidence, allowing me to attempt even more daring subjects.

Of course, many people have contributed to this new rendition. First, the two people who sent me the initial contract about this idea, Suzanne Lucas and Ginny Soh. Next I worked with Sarah Laichas, who was to be my new editor. Then, after a schedule change, I was given a new editor, Mary Bostic. She is a wonderful person, extremely patient with me. Of course, I never could have done this without her. And now I can't wait to see the finished product. It will be four months before I will be able to hold this new book in my hands, so I suppose I will just have to wait. Here's hoping you enjoy it!

## Dedication
