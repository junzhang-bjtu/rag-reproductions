HSBC USA Inc.
Executive Overview
HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") as "we," "us" or "our."
2020 Economic Environment The U.S. economy partially rebounded during the second half of 2020 after deteriorating rapidly into recession earlier in the year driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in disruption to business and economic activity as well as to the capital markets. COVID-19's effects in the U.S. and globally have been extreme, and the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate repercussions continue to remain unclear as recently introduced vaccines may not be widely available to the general public for some time and the take-up rate, once available, is uncertain. Unprecedented government economic intervention has likely dampened the pandemic's effects, but at uncertain long-term cost, and additional government support beyond what was enacted in 2020 is currently being considered. U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") contracted at an estimated annual rate of 3.5 percent in 2020, while the total unemployment rate continues to remain high at 6.7 percent at December 2020 as compared with 3.5 percent at December 2019. After cutting short-term interest rates by 150 basis points (to near zero) in March 2020 and announcing various other initiatives to enhance liquidity and support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the FRB held short-term interest rates steady for the remainder of the year and has indicated it expects short-term rates to remain low for some time until it is confident that the economy is far along in a recovery.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the United States and abroad during 2020 has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment including the length and depth of a global recession. Concerns over interest rate levels, energy prices, domestic and global policy issues, including civil unrest in the U.S., trade policy in the U.S. and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty. Interest rate levels and energy prices, in combination with global economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in 2021 and beyond.
2020 Events
•As mentioned above, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries and has caused disruption to our customers, vendors and employees. This pandemic has had a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations during the year, including the impairment of the goodwill previously allocated to our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units and an increase to the provision for credit losses on our loan portfolio. Additionally, in April 2020, Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") changed its rating outlook for both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable and, in May 2020, Standard and Poor's ("S&P") downgraded its long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA by one notch, following similar rating actions for HSBC. The circumstances around this pandemic will continue to impact our business in future periods. Should the current economic conditions persist or deteriorate further, it will continue to adversely impact our business which could include, but not be limited to, negative impacts on income due to lower interest rates, lower lending and transaction volumes, higher expected credit losses, lower wealth management revenue due to equity markets volatility and weakness, and increased model risk including credit loss models, capital models and asset/liability management models. Other potential risks include the impact of postponed health screenings on the well-being of our employees, credit rating migration which could negatively impact our risk-weighted assets and capital position, and potential liquidity stress due to, among other factors, increased customer drawdowns, notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the U.S. Government and the FRB have put in place to support funding and liquidity. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and credit ratings in future periods. The extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments, including but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic given that the pandemic may not be fully contained until a vaccine becomes widely available which might not occur until later in 2021, as well as its continuing impact on our customers, vendors and employees, all of which are uncertain. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks related to the impact of COVID-19" for further discussion.
•During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the amount of headroom calculated in our previous annual impairment test for certain reporting units, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2020 and concluded that the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. However, the cash flow projections for our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units were significantly lower than previous estimates which, in conjunction with valuation estimates under a market approach and in consideration of a challenging macroeconomic outlook, resulted in a fair value that was significantly lower than their book values, including goodwill. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $784
HSBC USA Inc.
million in the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to these reporting units. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, our Retail Banking and Wealth Management and our Private Banking reporting units are being reported together within a newly created Wealth and Personal Banking segment for segment reporting purposes. As discussed in "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used. For additional discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
•In February 2020, we announced a strategic plan to restructure our operations ("Restructuring Plan") in alignment with HSBC’s global strategy to refocus our wholesale operations to better serve our international corporate clients and restructure our retail operations to better meet the needs of globally mobile and affluent clients. Our Restructuring Plan also includes streamlining our functional and operations support model by removing duplication and reducing the size of our balance sheet to better align with the scope and scale of the U.S. opportunity. We currently expect to incur pre-tax charges in connection with this Restructuring Plan largely over the two-year period of 2020-2021 of approximately $520-$590 million ($390-$450 million after-tax). During 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges in connection with our Restructuring Plan totaling $280 million. See Note 3, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs.
Our Restructuring Plan is moving forward, including consolidation of our wholesale and retail middle and back office functions, each under a single operations structure, simplification of our support service functions, the exit of certain derivative contracts and the transfer of interest rate derivative contracts associated with Fixed Income activities to HSBC Bank plc. In 2020, we also completed the creation of our Wealth and Personal Banking business and the consolidation of our retail branch network, closing 76 branches during the year. As a result of these actions, we have lowered staffing levels by approximately 13 percent and reduced risk-weighted assets by approximately 11 percent as compared with December 31, 2019, and are on track to exceed our commitment to reduce total operating expenses by 10-15 percent by 2022. We remain committed to our multi-year strategic plan to re-profile our business, and continue to explore strategic options with respect to our retail operations to focus on our high net worth client base and wealth management products.
Performance, Developments and Trends Net income (loss) was a loss of $940 million during 2020 compared with income of $113 million and $320 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income (loss) before income tax was a loss of $982 million during 2020 compared with income of $270 million and $586 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in income (loss) before income tax during 2020 compared with 2019 was due to a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, higher operating expenses driven by higher goodwill impairment charges as discussed above and lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue. These decreases were partially offset by higher net interest income. The decrease in income (loss) before income tax during 2019 compared with 2018 was due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower net interest income due primarily to higher rates paid on deposits and lower other revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses as the impact of a $365 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019 was more than offset by expense of $492 million recorded in 2018 related to the settlement of a mortgage securitization legal matter.
Our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant, which affect comparability between periods. Significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends. The following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented:
HSBC USA Inc.
(1)Reflects costs related to the delivery of our Restructuring Plan as discussed further above. Costs to achieve primarily consisted of lease impairment and other related costs, severance costs, allocated costs from HSBC Technology & Services ("HTSU"), and trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts. See Note 3, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs. The expense during 2020 also includes $18 million of gains on sales of certain owned retail branch properties and $16 million of allocated costs from other HSBC affiliates related to the HSBC Group's restructuring activities.
(2)Reflects losses on the swap agreements we entered into to retain the litigation risk associated with the Visa Inc. ("Visa") Class B common shares ("Class B Shares") we sold to a third party in 2016 and 2017. See Note 27, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for addition information. In 2020, the loss primarily related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements. In 2019, the loss related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. In 2018, the loss related to changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate.
(3)Includes lease impairment and other related costs of $19 million related to a decision to exit certain branches in 2019 as well as $19 million of allocated lease impairment costs from HTSU.
(4)Reflects severance costs associated with a 2019 global effort aimed to right-size our cost base.
(5)The gain in 2020 related to the extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals. In 2019, HSBC Bank USA repurchased long-term debt that was designated under fair value option and recorded a net pre-tax gain on extinguishment of $84 million. The extinguishment resulted in the realization of a cumulative gain attributable to our own credit spread that was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which more than offset the premium paid to extinguish the debt. The net gain in 2019 also includes a loss of $14 million on extinguishment of certain repurchase agreements.
(6)Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.
Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during 2020 decreased $611 million compared with 2019 due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue which were partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher net interest income. Excluding the impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance during 2019 decreased $421 million compared with 2018 due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower net interest income due primarily to higher rates paid on deposits and lower other revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our asset and liability trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends.
London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") Transition Regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ("IBORs") to acceptable alternative rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("ARRC") convened by the FRB. In 2020, the FASB issued changes to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens associated with this transition. Under the new guidance, an entity is permitted to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract, if certain conditions are met. In addition, the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedge-by-hedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform, if certain conditions are met.
We have a considerable number of contracts referencing IBORs, primarily U.S. dollar ("USD") LIBOR, such as loans, derivatives and long-term debt, extending past 2021 when the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") originally announced it will no longer require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. In November 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration ("IBA"), the FCA-regulated and authorized administrator of LIBOR, announced a proposal to cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR term rates by the end of 2021 and extend publication of the remaining overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month USD LIBOR term rates, which are more heavily used, to the end of June 2023, subject to consultation. Concurrently, U.S. banking regulators issued a statement that acknowledged extending the publication of certain LIBOR term rates would allow most legacy LIBOR-based contracts to mature before LIBOR experiences disruption, but also encouraged banks to cease entering into new LIBOR-based contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by the end of 2021.
HSBC has established a global transition program in which we actively participate with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products, processes, models and curves, as well as all legacy LIBOR-based contracts, onto replacement rates. This program is aimed to minimize the risks arising from the transition by developing alternative rate product capabilities and transitioning legacy contracts. The program is significant in terms of scale and complexity and will impact all global businesses as well as multiple products, currencies, systems and processes. Transition results in a number of risks, mainly conduct risk, execution risk, financial risk and non-financial risk. We have developed a risk inventory, including mitigating actions, and the identified risks are being monitored. Furthermore, the transition could have a range of adverse impacts on our business, including legal proceedings or other actions regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in LIBOR contracts and regulatory investigations or reviews regarding our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates.
HSBC USA Inc.
While we continue to transact in LIBOR, our framework for limiting the sale of LIBOR-based products has been established and our businesses continue to inform their clients that there are risks associated with engaging in new LIBOR-based products. We have implemented risk disclosures for new sales of LIBOR-based contracts across all of our business lines and have incorporated the ARRC recommended fallback language into new LIBOR-based contracts for syndicated loans, bilateral loans, floating rate notes and adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans. During 2020, we updated the existing ARRC recommended fallback language for syndicated loans and bilateral loans with the revised hardwired fallback language published by the ARRC, under which the trigger events that would cause transition to a new benchmark rate and a waterfall of identified successor rates are specified. In addition, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association updated its benchmark fallback language for new LIBOR-based derivative contracts and established its industry protocol to facilitate the incorporation of the new fallback language into legacy non-cleared derivative contracts. We are adhering to the protocol, which became effective in January 2021. Separately, central clearing counterparties are expected to amend their rules no later than the first half of 2021 to incorporate the new fallback language and adhere to the protocol for cleared derivative contracts.
Our businesses continue to actively develop their capabilities to offer alternative rate products and the supporting processes and systems. During 2020, we implemented the capabilities to offer SOFR-based ARM loans in our Wealth and Personal Banking business, SOFR-based syndicated loans and real estate bilateral loans in our Commercial Banking business and SOFR-based syndicated loans, bilateral loans and derivatives in our Global Banking and Markets business. Additional SOFR-based derivative and bilateral loan capabilities are scheduled for implementation in 2021. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the speed at which we are able to develop these capabilities and the readiness of our customers to use alternative rate products. Consequently, the sale of LIBOR-based products will continue for longer than initially anticipated. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has likely affected the pace at which many of our customers will have been preparing to use alternative rate products and, therefore, also to transition their legacy contracts onto replacement rates.
The ability of HUSI and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability of products that reference replacement rates, including SOFR, and on our customers being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products. We have finalized pricing and data/workflow requirements related to transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates and, during the first quarter of 2021, will begin to engage our clients to increase awareness, provide alternative products and determine their ability and readiness to transition. We also continue to formulate plans to enable us to transition our LIBOR-based debt and other LIBOR-based debt where we are the payment agent, though execution of these transition plans will, to a certain extent, also depend on the engagement of third party market participants in the transition process.
The IBA proposal to extend the publication of certain USD LIBOR term rates to June 2023 discussed above will significantly aid in reducing the risks associated with transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates. The anticipated longer timeframe for transition may, however, increase potential timing differences between USD LIBOR-based assets and liabilities moving to SOFR prior to June 2023. In addition, the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan and the sale of substantially all of our LIBOR-linked variable rate debt securities maturing beyond 2021 have led to a reduction in our LIBOR exposures during 2020. We continue to engage with industry participants, the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition.
Other COVID-19 Related Developments
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and the U.S. Government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since March 2020. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), which provides financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions, was signed into law. In December 2020, additional COVID-19 relief legislation was enacted that extends many of the CARES Act programs and provides additional financial assistance for businesses and individuals.
Loan Forbearance Initiatives The CARES Act created a forbearance program for federally-backed mortgage loans and provided financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings ("TDR Loans") beginning March 1, 2020. This TDR Loan guidance has been extended and can now be applied until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days following the termination of the presidentially declared national emergency. During the third quarter of 2020, we elected to adopt the TDR Loan guidance in the CARES Act and are not applying TDR Loan classification to COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a long-term payment deferral (for commercial loans all payment modifications, including all payment deferrals) granted to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) as of December 31, 2019 which otherwise may have been reported as TDR Loans. The CARES Act also prohibits servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of 60 days. This moratorium has been extended until June 30, 2021. In addition to these federal measures, some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees. We
HSBC USA Inc.
are continuing to monitor federal, state and international regulatory developments in relation to COVID-19 and their potential impact on our operations.
In April 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic ("Interagency Statement"). The Interagency Statement confirmed that COVID-19 related short-term loan modifications (e.g., payment deferrals of six months or less) provided to borrowers that were current (less than 30 days past due) at the time the relief was granted are not TDR Loans. Borrowers that do not meet the criteria in the CARES Act or the Interagency Statement are assessed for TDR Loan classification in accordance with our accounting policies. Through December 31, 2020, these loans were not significant.
In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower’s past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less. For consumer mortgage loans, when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and, if the loan does not meet the criteria in the CARES Act, assessed for TDR Loan classification. Any accrued interest recorded on these loans is generally not reversed against income and will remain recorded as accrued interest receivable. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance.
We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table summarizes information about loans under these programs as of December 31, 2020. Not included in the following table are loans that have exited the programs as well as other forms of relief that we have provided to commercial clients affected by the impact of COVID-19, such as covenant waivers and amendments, and deferrals of financial statement and covenant compliance reporting requirements.
(1)Represents the percentage of loans under a COVID-19 related payment deferral program at December 31, 2020 for which at least one payment was collected during the fourth quarter of 2020.
(2)Total number of commercial loans is less than 25.
(3)Includes $763 million of consumer mortgage loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months at December 31, 2020. Due to our CARES Act election, $736 million of these loans were exempted from TDR assessment. In addition, $590 million of these loans have been placed on nonaccrual status, because the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months.
When the payment relief period ends, borrowers have various options, including repaying the deferred payments in full, repaying the deferred payments over an installment period or moving the deferred payments to the end of the loan. If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty when the payment relief period ends, they may enter into a modification program to reduce the interest rate and extend the term of the loan which would result in the loan being classified as a TDR Loan. As of December 31, 2020, $480 million and $910 million of commercial and consumer loans, respectively, have exited a COVID-19
HSBC USA Inc.
related payment deferral program, of which nil and $23 million, respectively, entered into a modification program upon exiting that resulted in the loans being classified as TDR Loans. Of the commercial and consumer loans that have exited a COVID-19 related payment deferral program, 100 percent and 82 percent, respectively, were current or less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2020.
Paycheck Protection Program The CARES Act created a new loan guarantee program entitled the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. PPP covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are satisfied. The SBA will reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven, and PPP lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. In addition, PPP loans are risk-weighted at zero percent under the generally-applicable Standardized Approach used to calculate risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes. HSBC Bank USA is a PPP participating lender and had loans funded under the PPP which totaled $1,043 million at December 31, 2020. The SBA deadline for accepting PPP loan applications from participating lenders has been extended until March 31, 2021.
Main Street Lending Program The Main Street Lending Program ("MSLP") was established by the FRB under the CARES Act to support lending to small and medium-sized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MSLP operates under various facilities depending on the size and other characteristics of the eligible businesses. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has set up a special purpose vehicle which will purchase 95 percent of each MSLP loan that is submitted to the program, provided that the required documentation is complete and the transactions are consistent with the relevant MSLP facility's requirements. As such, MSLP lenders will retain only 5 percent of an MSLP loan. We were not a participating lender in the MSLP, which expired on January 8, 2021.
Future Prospects Our operations are dependent upon our ability to grow revenues, maintain stable deposit balances and, to a lesser extent, access the global capital markets. Numerous factors, both internal and external, may impact our access to, and the costs associated with, both retail and wholesale sources of funding. These factors may include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility, the counterparty credit limits of investors to the HSBC Group, and our management of the credit risks inherent in our business and customer base.
Our results are also impacted by general global and domestic economic conditions, including employment levels, housing market conditions, property valuations, interest rates and legislative and regulatory changes, all of which are beyond our control. Changes in interest rates generally affect both the rates we charge to our customers and the rates we pay on our borrowings. Achieving our profitability goals in 2021 is largely dependent upon macroeconomic conditions which include the interest rate environment, housing market conditions, unemployment levels, market volatility, energy prices and our ability to attract and retain loans and deposits from customers, all of which could impact trading and other revenue, net interest income, loan volume, loss provision and ultimately our results of operations. Failure to successfully implement our business strategies may also have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
HSBC USA Inc.
Basis of Reporting
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").
Group Reporting Basis We report financial information to HSBC in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis"). Because operating results on the Group Reporting Basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees, our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting. The following table reconciles our U.S. GAAP versus Group Reporting Basis profit before tax:
The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Differences in reported profit (loss) before tax in the table above that were individually significant for 2020 and 2019 are explained below. See "Basis of Reporting" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 ("2019 Form 10-K") for an explanation of the differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for 2018.
During 2020, expected credit losses were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis. Under the Group Reporting Basis, a majority of our loans are considered to be in "stage 1" (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate), while under U.S. GAAP such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses estimate. Primarily as a result of the different approaches, loss provisions in 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses and downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients, were more pronounced under U.S. GAAP.
During 2019, credit loss estimates were higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis due primarily to the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, which was more pronounced under U.S. GAAP. In addition, expected credit losses under the Group Reporting Basis reflect a release in credit loss reserves due to the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client which resulted in reclassification from "stage 2" (which requires a lifetime expected credit losses estimate) to stage 1 (which requires a 12-month expected credit losses estimate). The higher credit loss estimates under U.S. GAAP were partially offset by a release in credit loss reserves under U.S. GAAP for risk factors associated with fraud.
During 2020 and 2019, goodwill impairment charges were lower under the Group Reporting Basis than under U.S. GAAP. Under the Group Reporting Basis, goodwill was amortized until 2005, however goodwill was amortized under U.S. GAAP until 2002, which resulted in lower carrying amounts of goodwill and, therefore, lower impairment charges under the Group Reporting Basis.
During 2020, we determined that long-lived assets comprising capitalized software, property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets may not be recoverable and tested the long-lived asset group for impairment. Under the Group Reporting Basis, we recorded an impairment charge of $277 million to write down the long-lived asset group to its estimated fair value, consisting of the write-off of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements
HSBC USA Inc.
primarily associated with our Wealth and Personal Banking business segment. Under U.S. GAAP, the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset group exceeded its carrying amount and no impairment charge was required. Consequently, the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements are higher under U.S. GAAP than under the Group Reporting Basis and, as a result, corresponding amortization expense is higher under U.S. GAAP. See Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
During 2019, extinguishment of long-term debt resulted in a gain under U.S. GAAP compared with a loss under the Group Reporting Basis. We previously elected to apply fair value option accounting to this debt. Under U.S. GAAP, the extinguishment resulted in the realization of a gain associated with our own credit spread that was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which more than offset the premium paid to extinguish the debt. Under the Group Reporting Basis, the gain associated with our own credit spread remains in equity and does not get recognized in earnings.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States. We believe our policies are appropriate and fairly present the financial position and results of operations of HSBC USA.
The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Certain critical accounting policies affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are complex and involve significant judgments by our management, including the use of estimates and assumptions. As a result, changes in estimates, assumptions or operational policies could significantly affect our financial position and our results of operations. We base our accounting estimates on historical experience, observable market data, inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and on various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate, including assumptions based on unobservable inputs. To the extent we use models to assist us in measuring the fair value of particular assets or liabilities, we strive to use models that are consistent with those used by other market participants. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. The impact of estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance may be material.
Of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, the items discussed below involve what we have identified as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies as well as the associated estimates, assumptions and accompanying disclosure with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Allowance for Credit Losses Because we lend money to others, we are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when contractually due. On January 1, 2020, we adopted new accounting guidance which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses ("lifetime ECL") for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Prior to January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses on loans was recognized based on probable incurred losses. See Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures. Consequently, we currently maintain an allowance for credit losses that reflects our estimate of lifetime ECL for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Allowance for credit loss estimates are reviewed periodically and adjustments are recognized in the provision for credit losses during the period they become known. Our Risk and Finance departments share responsibility for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost, including debt securities, and they assess and independently approve our allowance for credit losses.
The accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses is a "critical accounting estimate" for the following reasons:
•Changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results;
•Estimates related to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance, including cash flows, delinquencies and charge-offs, along with, when applicable, collateral values, based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forward-looking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default;
•Credit losses are influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices, interest rates, GDP, inflation, energy prices and unemployment; and
•Judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime ECL.
HSBC USA Inc.
Because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside of our control, there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates. Our estimate of lifetime ECL is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. Changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses.
As discussed further in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we utilize a minimum of three forward-looking economic scenarios to estimate lifetime ECL. In periods with high economic uncertainty, we supplement the lifetime estimate with alternative scenarios, each assigned a weighting based upon management's assessment of the likelihood of occurrence. This was the case beginning in 2020 as the economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created significant economic uncertainty. As a result, we developed and utilized a fourth scenario for estimating lifetime ECL, referred to as the "Alternative Downside scenario".
As an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses, using a 100 percent weighting for the Alternative Downside scenario instead of using the four weighted scenarios at December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures of approximately $385 million. This illustration only represents the effect of changes in the weighting of these scenarios on our existing modeled portfolios and does not consider changes in the allowance related to management judgment that might occur.
Our allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate but not excessive. The allowance for credit losses is regularly assessed for adequacy. The allowance for credit losses, which is carried as a reduction to the respective assets on the balance sheet, includes reserves for lifetime ECL associated with loans and other financial assets carried at amortized cost. A reserve is also maintained for off-balance sheet risk, which is recorded in other liabilities and includes lifetime ECL arising from off-balance sheet arrangements such as letters of credit and undrawn commitments to lend.
The allowances include amounts calculated for individual loan balances and for collective loan portfolios depending on the nature of the exposure and the manner in which risks inherent in that exposure are managed. In addition, the allowance for credit losses on consumer and commercial loans reflects management judgment of risk factors that may not be fully reflected in the lifetime ECL generated by our models. In making this determination, we consider the characteristics of our portfolio and any other significant factors that are relevant. Management review committees have been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ECL calculations. The management review committees have representatives from Credit Risk and Finance and are responsible for final approval of our lifetime ECL for the period. The committees also consider other observable factors, both internal and external to us in the general economy, to ensure that the estimates provided by the various models adequately include all known information at each reporting period.
Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for possible impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared with its carrying amount, which is determined on the basis of capital invested in the unit including attributable goodwill. We determine the invested capital of a reporting unit by applying to the reporting unit's risk-weighted assets a capital charge that is consistent with the targets assigned and monitored through our capital management monitoring framework, and additionally, allocating to each reporting unit the remaining carrying amount of HUSI's net assets. Accordingly, the entire carrying amount of HUSI's net assets is allocated to our reporting units. Significant and long-term changes in the applicable reporting unit's industry and related economic conditions are considered to be primary indicators of potential impairment due to their impact on expected future cash flows. In addition, shorter-term changes may impact the discount rate applied to such cash flows based on changes in investor requirements or market uncertainties. In evaluating possible impairment, specific factors we consider are: (a) the observance of material changes to business plan information (e.g., financial forecasts); (b) significant increases in observed peer group discount rates; (c) significant announced or planned business divestitures; (d) the margin by which the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount at the previous testing date; (e) deterioration in macroeconomic, industry or market conditions that have not yet been reflected in the latest business plan information, if any, and; (f) other relevant events specific to the reporting unit (e.g., changes in management, strategy or customers, capital allocation or litigation).
The determination of fair value as part of the impairment testing of our goodwill is a "critical accounting estimate" due to the significant judgment required in the use of the fair value approaches. We utilize the market approach and the discounted cash flow method to determine fair value. The market approach focuses on valuation multiples for reasonably similar publicly traded companies and also considers recent market transactions. The discounted cash flow method includes such variables as revenue growth rates, expense trends, interest rates and terminal values. Based on an evaluation of key data and market factors, management's judgment is required to select the specific variables to be incorporated into the models. Additionally, the estimated fair value can be significantly impacted by the risk adjusted cost of capital percentage used to discount future cash flows. The risk adjusted cost of capital percentage is derived from an appropriate capital asset pricing model, which itself depends on a number of financial and economic variables which are established on the basis of those believed to be used by
HSBC USA Inc.
market participants. Because our fair value estimate involves judgment and is influenced by factors outside our control, it is reasonably possible our judgment could change. When management's judgment is that the anticipated cash flows have decreased and/or the cost of capital percentage has increased, the effect will be a lower estimate of fair value which could result in an impairment charge and a negative impact to net income (loss).
Impairment testing of goodwill requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Goodwill was allocated to the carrying amount of each reporting unit based on its relative fair value. Movements of businesses across reporting units may result in a reallocation of goodwill.
We have historically established July 1 of each year as the date for conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment. Goodwill impairment is measured and an impairment charge is recorded at the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairments are not permitted.
During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the amount of headroom calculated in our previous annual impairment test for certain reporting units, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units as of March 31, 2020. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $784 million, representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units. During the third quarter of 2020, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with its fair value being approximately 110 percent of book value, including allocated goodwill. For additional discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, in order to better align with our annual internal planning and budgeting process, we changed our annual impairment assessment to be as of October 1. As a result of this change, we performed a goodwill impairment assessment of our Commercial Banking reporting unit under a qualitative analysis and determined that a quantitative test was not necessary as there were no events or changes in circumstances to indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of our Commercial Banking reporting unit has reduced below its carrying amount.
Our fair value calculations are highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used as discussed above. We will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings. If deterioration in economic and credit conditions, a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings, or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs, interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required, which may result in an impairment charge.
In addition, we generally conduct impairment tests of capitalized software and other long-lived assets at the reporting unit level when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impairment testing is required, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived asset group exceed its carrying amount, an impairment is not recognized. However, if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group, a second step is performed to determine fair value and an impairment loss is required if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds fair value. Impairment losses are not reversible. Fair value calculations when required are consistent with the methodology used to determine fair value for goodwill impairment.
Valuation of Financial Instruments A significant portion of our financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. These include trading assets and liabilities, derivatives held for trading or used for hedging, securities available-for-sale and equity securities. Furthermore, we have elected to measure specific assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option, including certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, structured deposits, structured notes, certain of our own debt issuances, and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, we use quoted prices to determine fair value. If quoted prices are not available, we base fair value on models using inputs that are either directly observable or are derived from and corroborated by market data.
Valuation of Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities - Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy as discussed further in Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest hierarchical level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As such, the classification of a financial asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is dynamic in that the asset or liability could be transferred to other hierarchy levels in each reporting period as a result of price discovery. We review and update our fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of the inputs into a fair value measurement may
HSBC USA Inc.
result in a reclassification between hierarchy levels. Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value were approximately 1.1 percent at December 31, 2020.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can impact the amount of revenue, expense or other comprehensive income recorded for a particular financial instrument. While we believe our valuation methods are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For additional discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value see Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following is a description of the methodologies used in the valuation of significant financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available.
•Derivatives - We manage groups of derivative instruments with offsetting market and credit risks. Accordingly, we measure the fair value of each group of derivative instruments based on the exit price of the group's net risk position. The fair value of a net risk position is determined using internal models that utilize multiple market inputs. The majority of the market inputs can be validated through market consensus data. For complex or long-dated derivative products where market data is not available, fair value is sensitive to the limitation of the valuation model (model risk), the liquidity of the product (liquidity risk) and the assumptions about inputs not obtainable through price discovery process (data uncertainty risk). Accordingly, we make valuation adjustments to capture the risks and uncertainties. Because of the interrelated nature, we do not separately make an explicit adjustment to the fair value for each of these risks. Instead, we apply a range of assumptions to the valuation input that we believe implicitly incorporates adjustments for liquidity, model and data uncertainty risks.
We also include a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net derivative positions. In estimating the credit valuation adjustment, we net the derivative positions by counterparties. The fair value for a net long credit risk position is adjusted for the counterparty's credit risk referred to as credit valuation adjustment whereas the fair value for a net short credit risk position is adjusted for HUSI's own credit risk referred to as debit valuation adjustment. We calculate the credit valuation adjustment by applying the probability of default of the counterparty to the expected exposure, and multiplying the result by the expected loss given default. We estimate the implied probability of default based on the credit spread of the specific counterparty observed in the credit default swap market. Where credit default spread of the counterparty is not available, we use the credit default spread of a specific proxy (e.g. the credit default swap spread of the counterparty's parent) or a proxy based on credit default swaps referencing to credit names of similar credit standing.
•Valuation of Securities - For the majority of our trading and available-for-sale securities, we obtain fair value for each security instrument from multiple independent pricing vendors ("IPV") and brokers, if available. We have established adequate controls in pricing vendor selection and fair value validation. The validation methods include but are not limited to comparisons among IPV prices for the same instrument, review and challenge of IPV valuation methodologies, inputs and assumptions, and the elapsed time between the date to which market data relates and the measurement date. For securities that are difficult to value, we use internal pricing models which estimate the fair value based on our assumptions in funding risk, default risk and loss upon default. We exercise significant judgment in estimating these assumptions and inputs to the valuation model. We believe these model inputs reflect market participants' assumptions about risks and the risk premium required to compensate for undertaking risks. For certain non-recourse instruments, we use the fair value of the collateral as a proxy to the measurement.
•Structured Notes and Deposits - Structured notes and deposits are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives. The valuation of the hybrid instruments is predominantly driven by the derivative features embedded within the instruments and our own credit risk. Depending on the complexity of the embedded derivative, the same risk elements of valuation adjustments described in the derivative section above would also apply to hybrid instruments. In addition, cash flows for the funded notes and deposits are discounted at the relevant interest rates for the duration of the instrument adjusted for our own credit spreads. The credit spreads so applied are determined with reference to our own debt issuance rates observed in primary and secondary markets, internal funding rates and the structured note rates in recent executions.
Except for structured notes and deposits with embedded credit derivative features, the associated risks embedded in the hybrid instruments issued to customers are economically hedged with our affiliates through a freestanding derivative. As a result, HUSI is market risk neutral in substantially all of the structured notes and deposits.
Because the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities are significantly impacted by the use of estimates, the use of different assumptions can result in changes in the estimated fair value of those assets and liabilities, which can result in equity and earnings volatility.
Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
HSBC USA Inc.
bases and for Federal and State net operating losses. Our net deferred tax assets, including deferred tax liabilities, totaled $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering negative and positive evidence, including our historical financial performance, projections of future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and any carryback availability. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. Because the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws, we have identified the assessment of deferred tax assets and the need for any related valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate.
We are included in HSBC North America's consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and in various combined State tax returns. We have entered into a tax allocation agreement with HSBC North America and its subsidiary entities which governs the current amount of taxes to be paid or received by the various entities and, therefore, we look at HSBC North America and its affiliates in reaching conclusions on recoverability. Based on our forecasts of future taxable income, we currently anticipate that our continuing operations will generate sufficient taxable income to allow us to realize our deferred tax assets.
The use of different assumptions of future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income and the application of inherently complex tax laws can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Furthermore, if future events differ from our current forecasts, valuation allowances may need to be established or adjusted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position. We will continue to update our assumptions and forecasts of future taxable income and assess the need and adequacy of any valuation allowance.
Our interpretations of tax laws are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and State taxing authorities. Resolution of disputes over interpretations of tax laws may result in us being assessed additional income taxes. We regularly review whether we may be assessed such additional income taxes and recognize liabilities for such potential future tax obligations as appropriate.
Additional detail on our assumptions with respect to the judgments made in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets and on the components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 can be found in Note 17, "Income Taxes," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Contingent Liabilities Both we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. These actions include assertions concerning violations of laws and/or unfair treatment of consumers. We have also been subject to various governmental and regulatory proceedings.
We estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different from those estimates. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings and the opinions and views of legal counsel.
Litigation and regulatory exposure is a critical accounting estimate because it represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control. Due to the inherent uncertainties and other factors involved in such matters, we cannot be certain that we will ultimately prevail in each instance. Such uncertainties impact our ability to determine whether it is probable that a liability exists and whether the amount can be reasonably estimated. Also, as the ultimate resolution of these proceedings is influenced by factors that are outside of our control, it is reasonably possible our estimated liability under these proceedings may change. We will continue to update our accruals for these legal, governmental and regulatory proceedings as facts and circumstances change. For further details, see Note 29, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Balance Sheet Review
The following table provides balance sheet totals at December 31, 2020 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2019:
*Percentage change is greater than 100 percent.
Short-Term Investments Short-term investments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Short-term investments increased compared with December 31, 2019 due to an increase in overall liquidity driven primarily by higher deposits as we actively raised funds in advance of their usage and our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses.
HSBC USA Inc.
Loans, Net The following table summarizes our loan balances at December 31, 2020 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2019:
(1)Represents large multinational firms including globally focused U.S. corporate and financial institutions, U.S. dollar lending to multinational banking clients managed by HSBC on a global basis and complex large business clients supported by GBM relationship managers.
(2)Includes loans to HSBC affiliates which totaled $1,100 million and $2,343 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(3)See "Credit Quality" in this MD&A for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans.
Commercial loans decreased compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending as well as lower demand from global banking clients reflecting increased capital markets activity coupled with economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the decrease was lower loans to affiliates. These decreases were partially offset by PPP loan originations in business and corporate banking. The decline in commercial non-affiliate loans was primarily in the diversified financial, real estate, energy, capital goods and semiconductor industries.
Consumer loans increased modestly compared with December 31, 2019 as higher residential mortgage loans which we continue to target towards our Premier and Advance customer relationships were largely offset by paydowns in credit card receivables due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment as well as a continued decline in home equity mortgages. The increase in other consumer loans reflects higher personal loans driven by new product promotions.
The following table presents loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans held for sale:
(1)LTVs for first liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date. LTVs for second liens are calculated using the loan balance as of the reporting date plus the senior lien amount at origination. Current estimated property values are derived from the property's appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index ("HPI") at either a Core Based Statistical Area or
HSBC USA Inc.
state level. The estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property, variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors. As a result, actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure.
(2)Current estimated property values are calculated using the most current HPIs available and applied on an individual loan basis, which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics. Therefore, the information in the table above reflects current estimated property values using HPIs at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Loans Held for Sale The following table summarizes loans held for sale at December 31, 2020 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2019:
*Percentage change is greater than 100 percent.
Commercial loans held for sale decreased compared with December 31, 2019. Included in commercial loans held for sale are certain loans that we have elected to designate under the fair value option which consists of loans that we originate in connection with our participation in a number of syndicated credit facilities with the intent of selling them to unaffiliated third parties as well as loans that we purchase from the secondary market and hold as hedges against our exposure to certain total return swaps. The fair value of these loans totaled $36 million and $178 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity.
Commercial loans held for sale also includes certain loans that we no longer intend to hold for investment and were transferred to held for sale which totaled $93 million and $34 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Consumer loans held for sale increased compared with December 31, 2019. Included in residential mortgage loans held for sale are agency-eligible residential mortgage loans which are originated and held for sale to third parties, currently on a servicing retained basis. Balances will fluctuate from period to period depending on the volume and level of activity. Gains and losses from the sale of these residential mortgage loans are reflected as a component of other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income (loss).
Excluding the commercial loans designated under fair value option discussed above, loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with adjustments to fair value being recorded as a valuation allowance through other revenues. The valuation allowance on consumer loans held for sale was nil and $2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The valuation allowance on commercial loans held for sale was $1 million and nil at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Trading securities balances were lower compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to decreases in foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions. Trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate, credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in corporate bond positions of $501 million reflecting the unwind of one of our unconsolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") which resulted in the termination of our investment in the VIE during the third quarter of 2020. Balances of securities sold, not yet purchased were lower compared with December 31, 2019 driven by a decrease in short U.S. Treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio.
Precious metals trading assets increased compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to increases in our own gold and silver inventory positions as well as higher spot prices. Payables for precious metals were higher compared with December 31, 2019 reflecting an increase in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels. Precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions, the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above.
Derivative asset balances decreased compared with December 31, 2019 mainly from market movements and reduced positions driven by the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. Derivative liability balances increased compared with December 31, 2019 as lower balances from market movements and reduced positions driven by the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan were more than offset by the impact of lower netting of outstanding positions and lower netting of cash collateral posted. Market movements resulted in lower valuations of interest rate and credit derivatives, partially offset by higher valuations of foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivatives.
Securities Securities include securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity, net. Securities balances were higher compared with December 31, 2019 driven by net purchases of U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed and foreign sovereign securities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes as well as favorable market valuations due to decreasing yields. These increases were partially offset by net sales and paydowns of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities as well as the sale of $340 million of LIBOR-linked variable rate held-to-maturity securities during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 5, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
At December 31, 2018, our securities available-for-sale portfolio, which totaled $31,379 million, consisted of $27,897 million of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency and U.S. Government sponsored obligations and $3,482 million of other available-for-sale securities and our securities held-to-maturity portfolio, which totaled $14,670 million, consisted of $14,657 million of U.S. Government agency and U.S. Government sponsored obligations, $11 million of U.S. state and political subdivision obligations and $2 million of other held-to-maturity securities.
All Other Assets All other assets includes, among other items, properties and equipment, net and goodwill. All other assets decreased compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million recorded during the first quarter of 2020, representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to our previously separate Retail Banking and
HSBC USA Inc.
Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units. For additional discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Also contributing to the decrease was lower outstanding clearing receivables from correspondent banks, lower deferred tax assets and lower lease assets. These decreases were partially offset by increased investments in Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") stock.
Deposits The following table summarizes deposit balances by major depositor categories at December 31, 2020 and increases (decreases) since December 31, 2019:
(1)Core deposits, as calculated in accordance with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines, generally include all domestic demand, money market and other savings accounts, as well as time deposits with balances not exceeding $250,000.
Total deposits increased compared with December 31, 2019 as we actively raised funds and our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. Also contributing to the increase in deposits was higher deposits from affiliates which reflects $5.0 billion of long-term debt obligations issued to HSBC North America that were recharacterized as time deposits during 2020 as discussed below. These increases were partially offset by a decline in time deposits.
Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings increased compared with December 31, 2019 reflecting higher securities sold under repurchase agreements and higher commercial paper outstanding.
Long-Term Debt Long-term debt decreased compared with December 31, 2019 as the impact of debt issuances, including increased borrowings from the FHLB, was more than offset by debt retirements and $5.0 billion of long-term debt obligations issued to HSBC North America that were recharacterized as time deposits during 2020. See Note 23, "Related Party Transactions," for additional information. Debt issuances during 2020 totaled $8,487 million, of which $5,093 million was issued by HSBC Bank USA.
Incremental issuances from our shelf registration statement with the SEC totaled $3,394 million of senior structured notes during 2020. Total long-term debt outstanding under this shelf was $9,138 million and $13,295 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Incremental issuances from the HSBC Bank USA Global Bank Note Program totaled $343 million during 2020. Total debt outstanding under this program was $1,888 million and $2,908 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Borrowings from the FHLB totaled $4,250 million and $1,000 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest, Taxes and Other Liabilities Interest, taxes and other liabilities were lower compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to lower outstanding settlement balances related to security purchases, a decline in accrued interest payable, lower margin requirements related to futures trading and lower lease liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by a higher liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures.
HSBC USA Inc.
Results of Operations
2019 compared with 2018 See "Results of Operations" in our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our operating results for 2019 compared with 2018. See below for a discussion of our operating results for 2020 compared with 2019.
Net Interest Income Net interest income is the total interest income on earning assets less the total interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. An analysis of consolidated average balances and interest rates is presented in this MD&A under the caption "Consolidated Average Balances and Interest Rates."
The significant components of net interest margin are summarized in the following table:
(1)Represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities. Increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities, while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities.
Net interest income increased during 2020 due primarily to lower interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by lower rates paid and a shift in mix to lower cost deposits as well as the favorable impact of higher average interest earning asset balances, primarily short-term investments and securities. These increases were partially offset by lower interest income from interest earning assets driven by lower yields on short-term investments, loans and securities. Despite the increase in net interest income, net interest margin on average earning assets declined during 2020 driven primarily by an increase in overall liquidity which was deployed into lower yielding short-term investments.
Short-term investments Interest income decreased during 2020 due to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances.
Trading securities Interest income decreased slightly during 2020 due to lower average balances driven by declines in foreign sovereign and U.S. Treasury positions, partially offset by a shift in mix to higher yielding equity positions. Interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below.
Securities Interest income was lower during 2020 due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. Higher average balances were driven by increases in U.S. Treasury, foreign sovereign and
HSBC USA Inc.
U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by a decline in U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities.
Commercial loans Interest income was lower during 2020 due primarily to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate loans and lower rates on newly originated PPP loans. Also contributing to the decrease was lower average balances driven by the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending, lower demand from global banking clients reflecting increased capital markets activity coupled with economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as lower loans to affiliates.
Consumer loans Interest income decreased during 2020 due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances due primarily to growth in residential mortgage loans.
Other Lower interest income during 2020 was due to lower yields on cash collateral posted reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average cash collateral balances.
Deposits Interest expense decreased during 2020 due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average balances. Higher average balances were due primarily to growth in savings and demand deposits as we actively raised funds and our customers increased their deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by the U.S. Government to provide financial support to households and businesses. Also contributing to the increase was higher deposits from affiliates.
Short-term borrowings Lower interest expense during 2020 was due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings driven by an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements.
Long-term debt Interest expense decreased during 2020 due to lower rates paid reflecting the impact of lower market rates on variable rate borrowings and lower average borrowings.
Tax liabilities and other Interest expense was lower during 2020 driven by lower rates paid and lower average borrowings in securities sold, not yet repurchased.
Provision for Credit Losses As discussed further in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses is recognized based on lifetime ECL for loans, off-balance sheet credit exposures, securities held-to-maturity and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost, as well as credit losses on securities available-for-sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, the provision for credit losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses for loans only while debt securities were assessed for other-than-temporary impairment and credit loss expense for probable incurred losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was separately recorded as a component of other expense within operating expenses as discussed below. As a result, current period amounts in the table below are not directly comparable to the prior year periods. The following table summarizes the components of the provision for credit losses:
HSBC USA Inc.
(1)As discussed below, prior to January 1, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures was recorded in other expense.
Our provision for credit losses increased $615 million during 2020 due to a higher provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, a higher provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio as well as a provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures recorded in 2020.
The provision for credit losses on our commercial loan portfolio increased $447 million. The loss provision in 2020 was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and provisions for risk factors associated with higher risk client and industry exposures, large loan exposures and economic uncertainty. In 2019, the loss provision was due primarily to downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients exposed to the energy and retail sectors, partially offset by releases in credit reserves due to paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as a release in credit reserves for risk factors associated with fraud.
The provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio increased $94 million. The loss provision in 2020 was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL and higher dollars of delinquency as well as provisions for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts. Also contributing to the loss provision in 2020 was growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. The loss provision in 2020 was partially offset by a decline in credit card balances due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current environment. In 2019, the loss provision was due primarily to a provision for credit losses on credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency and higher delinquency roll rates.
The provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures reflects a loss provision in 2020 resulting from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above.
Our methodology and accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are presented under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in this MD&A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See "Credit Quality" in this MD&A for additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses associated with our various loan portfolios.
HSBC USA Inc.
Other Revenues The following table summarizes the components of other revenues:
Credit card fees, net Credit card fees, net declined during 2020 driven by lower interchange fees due to lower customer spending, partially offset by lower cost estimates associated with our credit rewards program.
Trust and investment management fees Trust and investment management fees were flat during 2020.
Other fees and commissions Other fees and commissions decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower fees from loan commitments, loan syndication, wire transfers and other account services. These decreases were partially offset by higher fees from guarantees and standby letters of credit. See Note 22, "Fee Income from Contracts with Customers," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the components of other fees and commissions.
Trading revenue Trading revenue is generated by participation in the foreign exchange, rates, credit, equities and precious metals markets. The following table presents trading revenue by business activity. Not included in the table below is the impact of net interest income associated with trading securities which is an integral part of trading activities' overall performance. Net interest income related to trading activities is recorded in net interest income in the consolidated statement of income (loss). Trading revenue related to the mortgage banking business are included as a component of other income.
(1)Includes derivative contracts related to the Credit, Rates and Equities business activities within Global Markets as well as our legacy structured credit products. Derivative contracts related to the Foreign Exchange and Metals business activities within Global Markets as well as derivative products related to Markets Treasury, Global Banking and other trading are reported separately within those respective business activities.
(2)Derivatives trading revenue in all periods does not reflect associated net interest income as certain derivatives, such as total return swaps, were economically hedged by holding the underlying interest bearing referenced assets.
(3)During the fourth quarter of 2020, Balance Sheet Management was renamed Markets Treasury.
Trading revenue decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower Derivatives revenue reflecting the impact of our decision to exit or transfer certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan which resulted in lower revenue from emerging markets
HSBC USA Inc.
rate products and interest rate swaps, including trading losses of $67 million recorded in 2020. Also contributing to the decrease was lower Markets Treasury revenue due to the unfavorable performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk and lower other trading revenue reflecting the impact of favorable funding spread adjustments in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue due primarily to market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in increased trading opportunities as well as the non-recurrence of a loss of $39 million recorded in 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated VIEs.
Other securities gains, net We maintain securities portfolios as part of our balance sheet diversification and risk management strategies. During 2020 and 2019, we sold $12,197 million and $12,878 million, respectively, of primarily U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities as part of a continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes. Other securities gains, net increased during 2020 driven by higher gains from the sale of U.S. Treasury securities. The gross realized gains and losses from sales of securities, which are included as a component of other securities gains, net above, are summarized in Note 5, "Securities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including internal audit and marketing, partially offset by higher cost reimbursements associated with trading activities performed on behalf of HSBC Bank plc and higher sales commissions from HSBC Bank plc.
Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives We have elected to apply fair value option accounting to certain commercial loans held for sale, certain securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, certain of our own fixed-rate debt issuances, all of our hybrid instruments issued, including structured notes and deposits, and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment. We also use derivatives to economically hedge the interest rate and other risks associated with certain financial assets and liabilities for which fair value option accounting has been elected. Gain (loss) on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives improved during 2020 attributable primarily to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, partially offset by unfavorable fair value adjustments on certain commercial loans held for sale which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 16, "Fair Value Option," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information including a breakout of these amounts by individual component.
Other income Other income was lower during 2020 due primarily to higher valuation losses on commercial loans held for sale, higher losses on sales of commercial loans, unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity investments and lower net gains on extinguishment of debt. In 2020, we recorded a $12 million gain on extinguishment of time deposits reflecting early client withdrawals compared with a gain of $84 million on extinguishment of long-term debt and a loss of $14 million on extinguishment of certain repurchase agreements recorded in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by $18 million of gains on sales of certain owned retail branch properties recorded in 2020, higher residential mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and lower losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. In 2020, we recorded a loss of $9 million primarily related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements compared with a loss of $52 million recorded in 2019 related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate.
HSBC USA Inc.
Operating Expenses The following table summarizes the components of operating expenses:
(1)As discussed above, beginning January 1, 2020, credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in the provision for credit losses.
Salaries and employee benefits Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense, lower pension expense and lower salaries expense driven by staff reductions related to our Restructuring Plan. These decreases were partially offset by higher severance costs and lower health care reimbursements.
Support services from HSBC affiliates Servicing and other fees from HSBC affiliates decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower cost allocations from our technology, risk and compliance support service functions driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan. These decreases were partially offset by higher allocated severance, lease impairment and other related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates. In 2020, $80 million of costs were allocated to us from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates related to restructuring activities, primarily severance costs, support service project costs and contract cancellation, equipment removal and other costs associated with the office space consolidation and branch exits discussed below. In 2019, $37 million of severance and lease impairment costs were allocated to us from HTSU related to cost initiatives and the decision to exit certain office space in 2019. A summary of the services received from various HSBC affiliates is included in Note 23, "Related Party Transactions," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Occupancy expense, net Occupancy expense, net was higher during 2020 due to higher lease impairment and other related costs, partially offset by lower operating lease costs. In 2020, we recorded lease impairment and other related costs of $121 million related to the consolidation of our retail branch network and certain office space as part of our Restructuring Plan. See Note 3, "Strategic Initiatives," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. In 2019, we recorded lease impairment and other related costs of $19 million related to the decision to exit certain branches in 2019.
Goodwill impairment During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $784 million, representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management and Private Banking reporting units. During 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $365 million, representing a portion of the goodwill allocated to our previously separate Retail Banking and Wealth Management reporting unit. For additional discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 10, "Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
HSBC USA Inc.
Other expenses Other expenses were higher during 2020 due to increased deposit insurance assessment fees driven primarily by lower unsecured debt balances, lower levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software, higher expense related to legal matters, higher capitalized software amortization expense and higher professional fees. These increases were partially offset by lower marketing expense, lower travel expense and lower losses associated with card fraud.
Efficiency ratio Our efficiency ratio increased during 2020 due to higher operating expenses driven by higher goodwill impairment charges and lower other revenues driven by lower trading revenue, partially offset by higher net interest income as discussed in detail above.
Income tax expense (benefit) Our effective tax rate was (4.3) percent in 2020 compared with 58.1 percent in 2019 and 45.4 percent in 2018. For a complete analysis of the differences between effective tax rates based on the provision for income taxes attributable to pretax income (loss) and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate, see Note 17, "Income Taxes," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Segment Results - Group Reporting Basis
We have four distinct business segments that we utilize for management reporting and analysis purposes, which are aligned with HSBC's global business strategy: Wealth and Personal Banking ("WPB") which was created in 2020 and is discussed further below, Commercial Banking ("CMB"), Global Banking and Markets ("GBM") and a Corporate Center ("CC"). See Item 1, "Business," in this Form 10-K for a description of our segments which are based upon our global businesses, including a discussion of the main business activities of the segments and a summary of their products and services.
We previously announced as part of our Restructuring Plan that we would combine our Retail Banking and Wealth Management ("RBWM") and Private Banking ("PB") businesses to create a single WPB business. During 2020, we implemented a change to our internal management reporting to report what was historically RBWM and PB together within a newly created WPB segment and, as a result, we have aligned our segment reporting to reflect this change for all periods presented.
During 2020, we also decided to implement a change to our internal management reporting to allocate Balance Sheet Management, which was historically reported within the CC segment, to the WPB, CMB and GBM businesses to better align the revenue and expense to the businesses generating or utilizing this activity. As a result, we have aligned our segment reporting to reflect this change for all periods presented. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Balance Sheet Management was renamed Markets Treasury.
See Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a table that summarizes the impact of these changes on reported segment profit (loss) before tax, total assets and total deposits as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. There have been no additional changes in the basis of our segmentation as compared with the presentation in our 2019 Form 10-K.
Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components. Segments are charged a cost to fund assets (e.g. customer loans) and receive a funding credit for funds provided (e.g. customer deposits) based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing (interest rate risk) and tenor (liquidity) characteristics. The objective of these charges/credits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in Markets Treasury. Markets Treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities.
Certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity. These inter-segment transactions have not been eliminated, and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties.
We report financial information to our parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply IFRSs as issued by the IASB. As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the Group Reporting Basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a U.S. GAAP basis.
There have been no changes in the measurement of segment profit as compared with the presentation in our 2019 Form 10-K.
The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and the Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results are summarized in Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
HSBC USA Inc.
2019 compared with 2018 See "Segment Results - Group Reporting Basis" in our 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of our segment results for 2019 compared with 2018. See below for a discussion of our segment results for 2020 compared with 2019.
Wealth and Personal Banking The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our WPB segment:
(1)The following table summarizes the impact of key activities on the total operating income of our WPB segment:
(2)Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates and allocated Markets Treasury revenue.
Our WPB segment reported a higher loss before tax during 2020 due primarily to higher operating expenses driven by higher impairment charges recorded in 2020, including a goodwill impairment charge, representing the entire amount of remaining goodwill previously recorded, and an impairment charge related to the write-off of all the capitalized software associated with our WPB business segment, which collectively totaled $900 million. In 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $209 million, representing a portion of the goodwill previously recorded. Also contributing to the higher loss before tax during 2020 was lower net interest income and higher expected credit losses, partially offset by higher other operating income.
Net interest income decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by improved loan spreads and higher residential mortgage loan balances.
Other operating income increased during 2020 due to higher residential mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gains on sales of residential mortgage loans, the non-recurrence of a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt recorded in 2019 and lower losses on the swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares. In 2020, we recorded a loss of $9 million primarily related to extending the maturity of the total return swap position used to economically hedge the periodic payments made under the swap agreements compared with a loss of $52 million recorded in 2019 related to an increase in the expected timing of the final resolution of the related litigation and, to a lesser extent, changes in the Visa Class B Share conversion rate. These increases were partially offset by lower credit card fees due to lower customer spending.
Expected credit losses were higher during 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL and higher dollars of delinquency as well as higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts. Also contributing to the increase was growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in credit card balances due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current environment.
Excluding the impairment charges as discussed above, operating expenses decreased during 2020 due to lower marketing expense, lower pension expense, lower salaries expense driven by staff reductions related to our Restructuring Plan, lower cost allocations from our technology and risk support service functions and lower losses associated with card fraud. These decreases were partially offset by higher deposit insurance assessment fees, lower levels of expense capitalization related to internally developed software, higher expense related to legal matters and higher severance costs.
HSBC USA Inc.
Client Assets The following table provides information regarding private banking client assets during 2020 and 2019:
(1)Reflects client asset transfers associated with the sale of certain private banking client relationships to UBS, which concluded in 2019.
Commercial Banking The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our CMB segment:
(1)The following table summarizes the impact of key activities on the total operating income of our CMB segment:
(2)Includes allocated Markets Treasury revenue.
Our CMB segment reported a lower profit before tax during 2020 due primarily to higher expected credit losses and, to a lesser extent, lower net interest income, lower other operating income and higher operating expenses.
Net interest income decreased during 2020 due to lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher average deposit and loan balances.
Other operating income decreased during 2020 due primarily to higher losses on sales of loans and lower fees from loan syndication and loan commitments, partially offset by the non-recurrence of a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt recorded in 2019.
Expected credit losses were higher during 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with higher risk client and industry exposures.
Operating expenses increased during 2020 due primarily to higher deposit insurance assessment fees, higher salaries expense, higher severance costs and higher cost allocations from our support service functions. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, lower marketing expense and lower travel expense.
HSBC USA Inc.
Global Banking and Markets The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our GBM segment:
(1)The following table summarizes the impact of key activities on the total operating income of our GBM segment. For purposes of the discussion below the table, total operating income is referred to as revenue.
(2)Beginning in June 2020, we changed our presentation for issuer services revenue that was previously reported in Securities Services and began reporting this revenue in Global Banking. As a result, we have reclassified $36 million and $38 million of operating income from Securities Services to Global Banking in 2019 and 2018, respectively, to conform to the current year presentation.
(3)Includes cost reimbursements associated with activities performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, allocated Markets Treasury revenue and certain corporate funding charges not assigned to products.
Our GBM segment reported a lower profit before tax during 2020 due primarily to higher expected credit losses and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher other operating income.
Credit revenue decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower revenue from structuring and collateralized financing related activity.
Rates revenue decreased during 2020 due to lower revenue from interest rate swaps as well as trading losses of $67 million recorded in 2020 associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our Restructuring Plan. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from emerging markets rate products.
Foreign Exchange and Metals revenue increased during 2020 due primarily to market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in increased trading opportunities.
Equities revenue increased during 2020 due to trading opportunities in derivatives and increased client activity in prime brokerage.
Global Banking revenue decreased during 2020 due primarily to lower fees from loan commitments and loan syndication, higher losses on sales of loans and lower net interest income from spread compression and lower loan balances. Lower loan balances were driven by the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending as well as lower demand reflecting increased capital markets activity by clients coupled with economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Global Liquidity and Cash Management revenue decreased during 2020 due to lower net interest income driven by lower deposit spreads reflecting the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher deposit balances.
Securities Services revenue was relatively flat during 2020.
Global Trade and Receivables Finance revenue was higher during 2020 due to higher fees from standby letters of credit.
HSBC USA Inc.
Credit and funding valuation adjustments were lower during 2020 attributable primarily to lower gains from credit valuation adjustments on derivative assets reflecting the impact of market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of lower market rates.
Other revenue increased during 2020 due to lower corporate funding charges, higher allocated Markets Treasury revenue and the non-recurrence of a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt recorded in 2019, partially offset by higher liquidity charges and lower cost reimbursements.
Expected credit losses increased during 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used for calculating ECL, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with oil and gas industry loan exposures and higher risk client exposures.
Operating expenses were lower during 2020 due primarily to lower incentive compensation expense, lower salaries expense and lower cost allocations from our technology, risk, and compliance support service functions. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense related to legal matters, higher deposit insurance assessment fees and higher severance costs.
Corporate Center The following table summarizes the Group Reporting Basis results for our CC segment:
(1)The following table summarizes the impact of key activities on the total operating income of our CC segment:
Our CC segment reported a higher loss before tax during 2020 due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other operating income and lower net interest expense.
Net interest expense was lower during 2020 driven by improved net interest income from legacy structured credit products and lower retained liquidity charges.
Other operating income increased during 2020 due to favorable movements related to the economic hedging of interest rate risk within our own debt, the non-recurrence of a $39 million loss recorded in 2019 related to the unwind of one of our unconsolidated VIEs and $18 million of gains on sales of certain owned retail branch properties recorded in 2020. These increases were partially offset by lower valuation gains on legacy structured credit products, lower cost reimbursements associated with shared services performed on behalf of other HSBC affiliates, including internal audit and marketing, as well as unfavorable fair value adjustments on equity investments.
Operating expenses were higher during 2020 due primarily to higher lease impairment and other related costs. In 2020, we recorded lease impairment and other related costs of $185 million related to the consolidation of our retail branch network and certain office space as part of our Restructuring Plan, including an impairment charge of $55 million recorded during the third quarter of 2020 related to the write-off of a portion of the leasehold improvements associated with our WPB business. In 2019, we recorded lease impairment and other related costs of $21 million related to the decision to exit certain branches in 2019. Also contributing to the increase were higher allocated severance, lease impairment and other related costs from HTSU and other HSBC affiliates. These increases were partially offset by lower cost allocations from our technology, risk and compliance support service functions driven by the execution of our Restructuring Plan.
Reconciliation of Segment Results As previously discussed, segment results are reported on a Group Reporting Basis. See Note 24, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our Group Reporting Basis segment results to U.S. GAAP consolidated totals.
HSBC USA Inc.
Credit Quality
In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of transactions that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers. We participate in lending activity throughout the United States and, on a limited basis, internationally.
COVID-19 Loan Forbearance Initiatives We have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Substantially all of the loans under these programs are not classified as TDR Loans at December 31, 2020 due to our election to suspend TDR Loan classification under the CARES Act or their short-term nature as discussed under the Interagency Statement. In addition, under the Interagency Statement, for COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower’s past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and, if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted, the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less. For consumer mortgage loans, when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months, the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and, if the loan does not meet the criteria in the CARES Act, assessed for TDR Loan classification. We have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance. These COVID-19 related payment deferral programs could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who may have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status had such relief not been offered. See "Executive Overview," in this MD&A for additional information.
Allowance for Credit Losses / Liability for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures Our accounting policies and methodologies related to the allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures are presented in further detail under the caption "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in this MD&A and in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our approach toward credit risk management is summarized under the caption "Risk Management" in this MD&A.
As discussed further in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, beginning January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses is recognized based on lifetime ECL for loans, securities held-to-maturity and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost, and an allowance for credit losses is also recognized for securities available-for-sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, an allowance for credit losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses for loans only while debt securities were assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. In addition, beginning January 1, 2020, the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized based on lifetime ECL while, prior to January 1, 2020, it was recognized based on probable incurred losses. The new guidance also requires inclusion of expected recoveries of amounts previously written off, limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-offs, when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets (including collateral-dependent assets). Prior to January 1, 2020, these expected recoveries were not recognized.
Comparative credit information at January 1, 2020, reflecting the adoption of the new accounting guidance, has been included in the tables below where available. Credit information at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which is not comparable to 2020 as it does not reflect the adoption of the new accounting guidance, has been retained as previously reported.
The following table summarizes our allowance for credit losses and the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures:
(1)Primarily includes accrued interest receivables and customer acceptances.
HSBC USA Inc.
See Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the changes in our allowance for credit losses and liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at January 1, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019.
The total allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 increased $545 million or 115 percent as compared with January 1, 2020 due to higher loss estimates on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, higher loss estimates on our consumer loan portfolio.
Our commercial allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 increased $433 million or 114 percent as compared with January 1, 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL, downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with higher risk client and industry exposures, large loan exposures and economic uncertainty.
Our consumer allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 increased $115 million or 134 percent as compared with January 1, 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ECL and higher dollars of delinquency as well as higher loss estimates for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts. Also contributing to the increase was growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions. These increases were partially offset by a decline in credit card balances due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current environment.
The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures at December 31, 2020 increased $79 million or 50 percent as compared with January 1, 2020 resulting from the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above.
Summary of Credit Loss Experience for Loans
The following table presents the allowance for credit losses on loans by major loan categories:
(1)See Note 7, "Allowance for Credit Losses," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for components of the commercial allowance for credit losses.
HSBC USA Inc.
The following table sets forth key ratios for the allowance for credit losses on loans for the periods indicated:
(1)Ratios exclude loans held for sale as these loans are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
(2)Ratios reflect full year net charge-offs. Ratios at January 1, 2020 reflect full year net charge-offs for 2019.
(3)Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 90 months, 135 months, 134 months, 49 months and 56 months, respectively. The net charge-off coverage ratio represents the commercial allowance for credit losses at period end divided by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during the period. Our commercial net charge-off coverage ratio for January 1, 2020, calculated by dividing the commercial allowance for credit losses at January 1, 2020 by average monthly commercial net charge-offs during 2019, was 102 months.
(4)Represents our commercial and consumer allowance for credit losses, as appropriate, divided by the corresponding outstanding balance of total nonperforming loans held for investment. Nonperforming loans include accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more.
HSBC USA Inc.
The following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses on loans by product or line of business during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
(1)The provision for credit losses and charge-offs for residential mortgage loans during 2016 includes $11 million related to the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment attributable to credit factors for loans transferred to held for sale.
HSBC USA Inc.
(2)For collateral dependent loans that are transferred to held for sale, the existing allowance for credit losses at the time of transfer are recognized as a charge-off. We transferred to held for sale certain residential mortgage loans during 2016 and, accordingly, we recognized the existing allowance for credit losses on these loans as additional charge-offs totaling $22 million during 2016.
The allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2020 increased $548 million or 117 percent as compared with January 1, 2020 due to higher loss estimates on our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, higher loss estimates on our consumer loan portfolio as discussed in detail above.
The allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2019 increased $96 million or 18 percent as compared with December 31, 2018 due to higher loss estimates in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. Our commercial allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 increased $49 million or 11 percent as compared with December 31, 2018 due primarily to downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients exposed to the energy and retail sectors, partially offset by releases in credit reserves due to paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients as well as charge-offs and a release in credit reserves for risk factors associated with fraud. Our consumer allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019 increased $47 million or 57 percent as compared with December 31, 2018 due primarily to a higher allowance for credit losses in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions, including higher dollars of delinquency and higher delinquency roll rates.
The allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2018 decreased $140 million or 21 percent as compared with December 31, 2017 due to lower loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio, partially offset by higher loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio. Our commercial allowance for credit losses decreased $150 million or 25 percent as compared with December 31, 2017 reflecting improvements in the credit quality of our portfolio driven by paydowns, sales and maturities as well as improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients. These decreases were partially offset by a higher provision for risk factors associated with geopolitical risks and market volatility inherent in certain segments of the portfolio and higher provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain client relationships. Our consumer allowance for credit losses increased $10 million or 14 percent as compared with December 31, 2017 due to a higher allowance for credit losses in credit cards reflecting growth in customer activity driven by new product promotions along with an associated increase in dollars of delinquency, partially offset by a lower allowance for credit losses in residential mortgages and home equity mortgages due to improvements in economic and credit conditions, including lower dollars of delinquency.
The allowance for credit losses on loans at December 31, 2017 decreased $336 million or 33 percent as compared with December 31, 2016 due primarily to lower loss estimates in our commercial loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, lower loss estimates in our consumer loan portfolio. Our commercial allowance for credit losses decreased $322 million or 35 percent as compared with December 31, 2016 largely due to improvements in the credit quality of our portfolio driven by managed reductions in certain exposures, releases of reserves due to paydowns and maturities exceeding new loan originations as we focused efforts on improving returns, improvements in credit conditions associated with certain client relationships and the partial charge-off of a single mining client relationship. Our consumer allowance for credit losses decreased $14 million or 16 percent as compared with December 31, 2016 due to improvements in economic and credit conditions, the origination of higher quality Premier mortgages and lower loss estimates in our home equity mortgage portfolio reflecting lower outstanding balances. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of a slight increase in delinquency levels.
The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment at December 31, 2020 as compared with January 1, 2020 and at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 as compared with their respective prior year periods increased or decreased due primarily to the changes in the allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above.
The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of net charge-offs at December 31, 2020 increased as compared with January 1, 2020 as the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced an increase in dollars of net charge-offs driven by higher charge-offs in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. In 2019, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of net charge-offs decreased as an increase in dollars of net charge-offs driven by higher charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio, primarily credit cards, outpaced the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2018, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of net charge-offs increased as a decrease in dollars of net charge-offs driven by lower charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio associated with a single mining client relationship and loan sales outpaced the decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2017, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of net charge-offs was relatively flat as lower dollars of net charge-offs in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios was largely offset by a decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above.
The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment at December 31, 2020 decreased as compared with January 1, 2020 as an increase in nonperforming loans driven by higher nonperforming loans in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios outpaced the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2019, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment was relatively flat as an increase in nonperforming loans driven by higher nonperforming loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios was offset by the increase in our allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2018,
HSBC USA Inc.
the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment increased driven by a decrease in nonperforming loans due primarily to managed reductions in certain exposures in our commercial loan portfolio which was partially offset by a decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above. In 2017, the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans held for investment decreased as the decrease in our overall allowance for credit losses for the reasons discussed above outpaced the decreases in nonperforming loans driven by our commercial loan portfolio.
Delinquency The following table summarizes dollars of two-months-and-over contractual delinquency and two-months-and-over contractual delinquency as a percentage of total loans ("delinquency ratio"). For COVID-19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral, the borrower's past due status will not be affected during the deferral period.
(1)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, consumer mortgage loan delinquency includes $281 million and $256 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.
(2)The following table reflects dollars of contractual delinquency and delinquency ratios for interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans:
Our two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 26 basis points compared with December 31, 2019 due to higher dollars of delinquency in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios and, to a lesser extent, lower outstanding loan balances driven by lower commercial loans.
Our commercial loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 18 basis points compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including a global banking client with became 60 days delinquent. Also contributing to the increase in the ratio was lower outstanding loan balances.
Our consumer loan two-months-and-over contractual delinquency ratio increased 23 basis points compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to higher dollars of delinquency in residential mortgages driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as some customers did not seek forbearance relief or became 60 days delinquent prior to seeking forbearance relief. The increase was partially offset by lower dollars of delinquency in credit cards reflecting a decline in balances due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current environment.
HSBC USA Inc.
Net Charge-offs of Loans The following table summarizes net charge-off (recovery) dollars as well as net charge-off (recovery) of loans for the period as a percentage of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, ("net charge-off ratio"):
Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 13 basis points in 2020 compared with 2019 due to higher levels of net charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio driven by the deterioration of two corporate banking loans and loan sales as well as higher levels of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by higher charge-offs in credit cards and other consumer loans reflecting the deterioration of economic conditions. These increases were partially offset by improved net charge-offs in residential mortgages.
Our net charge-off ratio as a percentage of average loans increased 4 basis points in 2019 compared with 2018 due primarily to higher levels of net charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolio driven by higher charge-offs in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions.
HSBC USA Inc.
Nonperforming Loans The following table summarizes nonperforming loans, including nonaccrual loans and accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due, as well as nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans ("nonperforming ratio"):
(1)See Note 6, "Loans," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a breakout of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, total nonperforming loans include $21 million, $30 million and $21 million, respectively, of accruing loans contractually 90 days or more past due, primarily credit cards and other consumer loans.
(2)At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, nonperforming consumer mortgage loans include $375 million, $289 million and $289 million, respectively, of loans that are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the collateral less cost to sell.
(3)Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans held for investment include all loans which are 90 or more days contractually delinquent as well as loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not re-affirmed and second lien loans where the first lien loan that we own or service is 90 or more days contractually delinquent. At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual consumer mortgage loans also include $590 million of loans under COVID-19 related payment deferral programs where the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months and, as a result, have been placed on nonaccrual status.
(4)Nonperforming consumer mortgage loans for all periods does not include guaranteed loans purchased from the Government National Mortgage Association. Repayment of these loans is predominantly insured by the Federal Housing Administration and as such, these loans have different risk characteristics from the rest of our customer loan portfolio.
(5)Includes $1 million or less of commercial other real estate owned at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our nonperforming loans ratio increased 174 basis points at December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to higher nonperforming loans in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio increased 344 basis points at December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to higher nonperforming loans in residential mortgages driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including customers that did not seek forbearance relief, were placed on nonaccrual status prior to seeking forbearance relief or utilized a payment deferral of more than six months. Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio increased 82 basis points at December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to higher nonperforming loans reflecting downgrades driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our nonperforming loans ratio increased 20 basis points at December 31, 2019 compared with December 31, 2018 due to higher nonperforming loans in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. Our commercial nonperforming loans ratio increased 20 basis points at December 31, 2019 compared with December 31, 2018 driven by downgrades, partially offset by paydowns and charge-offs. Our consumer nonperforming loans ratio increased 12 basis points at December 31, 2019 compared with December 31, 2018 largely due to some private banking residential mortgage customer which became 90 days due and higher nonperforming loans in credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions.
Accrued but unpaid interest on loans placed on nonaccrual status generally is reversed and reduces current income at the time loans are so categorized. Interest income on these loans may be recognized to the extent of cash payments received. Our policies and practices for problem loan management and placing loans on nonaccrual status are summarized in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as updated for COVID-19 related loan modifications.
HSBC USA Inc.
Criticized Commercial Loans The following table summarizes criticized commercial loans:
Criticized loans increased in 2020 due to downgrades across a broad range of industries driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, criticized loans increased due to downgrades, partially offset by paydowns and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain client relationships.
Concentration of Credit Risk A concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic conditions. We enter into a variety of transactions in the normal course of business that involve both on and off-balance sheet credit risk. Principal among these activities is lending to various commercial, institutional, governmental and individual customers throughout the United States and internationally. We manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and off-balance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval, monitoring and reporting process. It is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate. Varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon management's credit evaluation.
Commercial Credit Exposure Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Commercial loans outstanding and unused commercial commitments by industry are presented in the table below:
(1)Based on utilization at December 31, 2020.
(2)Excludes commercial credit exposures with affiliates.
HSBC USA Inc.
Geographic Concentrations The following table reflects regional exposure at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for our real estate secured loan portfolios:
Residential Mortgage Loans Our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans:
•Interest-only loans - A loan which allows a customer to pay the interest-only portion of the monthly payment for a period of time which results in lower payments during the initial loan period.
•Adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans - A loan which allows us to adjust pricing on the loan in line with market movements.
The following table summarizes the balances of interest-only and ARM loans in our loan portfolios at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Each category is not mutually exclusive and loans may appear in more than one category below.
(1)During 2021 and 2022, approximately $652 million and $762 million, respectively, of the ARM loans will experience their first interest rate reset.
The following table summarizes the concentrations of first and second liens within the outstanding residential mortgage and home equity mortgage portfolios. Amounts in the table exclude residential mortgage loans held for sale of $208 million and $77 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(1)A majority of revolving are second lien mortgages.
HSBC USA Inc.
Cross-Border Net Outstandings Cross-border net outstandings are amounts payable by residents of foreign countries regardless of the currency of claim and local country claims in excess of local country obligations. Cross-border net outstandings, as calculated in accordance with FFIEC guidelines, include deposits placed with other banks, loans, acceptances, securities available-for-sale, trading securities, revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative contracts and accrued interest receivable. Excluded from cross-border net outstandings are, among other things, the following: local country claims funded by non-local country obligations (U.S. dollar or other non-local currencies), principally certificates of deposit issued by a foreign branch, where the providers of funds agree that, in the event of the occurrence of a sovereign default or the imposition of currency exchange restrictions in a given country, they will not be paid until such default is cured or currency restrictions lifted or, in certain circumstances, they may accept payment in local currency or assets denominated in local currency; and cross-border claims that are guaranteed by cash or other external liquid collateral. Cross-border net outstandings that exceed .75 percent of total assets at year-end are summarized in the following table:
HSBC USA Inc.
Credit Risks Associated with Derivative Contracts Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. In managing derivative credit risk, both the current exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered. Counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions, central clearing parties, foreign and domestic government agencies, corporations, funds (mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), insurance companies and private clients as well as other HSBC entities. These counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department. To minimize credit risk, we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties. The determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty and/or regulatory requirements.
The total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables, such as:
•volatility of interest rates, currencies, equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments;
•current market events or trends;
•country risk;
•maturity and liquidity of contracts;
•creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction;
•the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties; and
•existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures.
The table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general risk-based capital rules of the Basel III Standardized Approach which includes the net positive mark-to-market of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount. The regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and, therefore, allow for reductions of risk-weighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists. As a result, risk-weighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures. Furthermore, many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral. In addition, many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date. As a result, these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules.
The table below summarizes the risk profile of the counterparties to derivative contracts with credit risk exposure, net of cash and other highly liquid collateral. The ratings presented in the table below are equivalent ratings based on our internal credit rating system.
HSBC USA Inc.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Effective liquidity management is defined as ensuring we can meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. To achieve this objective, we have guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Guidelines are set for the consolidated balance sheet of HSBC USA to ensure that it is a source of strength for our regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiary, as well as to address the more limited sources of liquidity available to it as a holding company. Similar guidelines are set for HSBC Bank USA to ensure that it can meet its liquidity needs in various stress scenarios. Cash flow analysis, including stress testing scenarios, forms the basis for liquidity management and contingency funding plans. See "Risk Management" in this MD&A for further discussion of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, including information regarding the key measures employed to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk.
During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruption to the financial markets as well as business and economic activity. We continue to actively monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity or funding capabilities as a result of this disruption. While there was elevated commercial loan demand in March as clients drew on their available lines of credit during the deterioration in economic conditions, we actively raised deposits, short-term borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements, and borrowed from the FHLB in order to support the elevated client demand for loans while maintaining adequate liquidity and increasing cash. In addition, substantially all of the commercial lines of credit that were drawn in March have been repaid. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our framework as necessary to reflect market events.
FRB Liquidity Facilities The FRB announced the creation of several facilities aimed at stabilizing the markets, addressing immediate liquidity concerns, and facilitating lending and other assistance to businesses and individuals affected by shutdowns due to COVID-19. These programs include, among others, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. We have not utilized any of these facilities.
Interest Bearing Deposits with Banks totaled $14,353 million and $2,038 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $13,895 million and $1,801 million, respectively, were held with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Surplus interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank may be deployed into securities purchased under agreements to resell or other investments depending on market conditions and the opportunity to maximize returns.
Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell totaled $35,746 million and $17,838 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity.
Trading Assets includes securities totaling $19,494 million and $23,488 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&A for further analysis and discussion on trends.

See "Balance Sheet Review" in this MD&A for further analysis and discussion on long-term debt trends, including additional information on debt issued and repaid during 2020.
HSBC USA Inc.
Under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, we may issue certain securities including debt securities and preferred stock. We satisfy the eligibility requirements for designation as a "well-known seasoned issuer," which allows us to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. The ability to issue under the registration statement is limited by the authority granted by the Board of Directors. During 2020, due to an anticipated decrease in utilization of the shelf registration statement, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the amount we are authorized to issue from $30,000 million at December 31, 2019 to $25,000 million, of which $15,862 million was available at December 31, 2020. HSBC Bank USA has a $40,000 million Global Bank Note Program that provides for the issuance of subordinated and senior notes, of which $12,949 million was available at December 31, 2020. We anticipate using the Global Bank Note Program more in the future as part of our efforts designed to minimize overall funding costs while accessing diverse funding channels.
As a member of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we have secured borrowing facilities which are collateralized by loans and investment securities. At December 31, 2020, long-term debt included $4,250 million of borrowings from the FHLB facility. Based upon the amounts pledged as collateral under these facilities, we have additional borrowing capacity of up to $12,458 million.
Preferred Equity See Note 18, "Preferred Stock," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding all outstanding preferred share issues.
Common Equity During 2020, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America, and did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA.
Capital Ratios In managing capital, we develop targets for common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to adjusted quarterly average assets (i.e., the "Tier 1 leverage ratio") and Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure (i.e., the "supplementary leverage ratio" or "SLR"). Capital targets are reviewed at least semi-annually to ensure they reflect our business mix and risk profile, as well as real-time conditions and circumstances. The following table summarizes HSBC USA's Basel III capital ratios calculated as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)Adjusted quarterly average assets, the Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator, reflects quarterly average assets adjusted for amounts permitted to be deducted from Tier 1 capital.
(2)Total leverage exposure, the SLR denominator, includes adjusted quarterly average assets plus certain off-balance sheet exposures.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides the option to transition in the regulatory capital impacts of the new current expected credit loss accounting standard over a five-year period. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have elected the five-year transition option and, as a result, beginning in 2020, our capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the final rule. Accordingly, during 2020 and 2021, we will exclude from regulatory capital the change in retained earnings resulting from adoption of the new accounting standard on January 1, 2020 as well as 25 percent of the change in the allowance for credit losses recognized between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, the excluded impacts will be phased in to regulatory capital over a three-year transition period and will be fully reflected at January 1, 2025.
Also in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB issued a final rule adopting a temporary change to the calculation of the SLR that permits IHCs, such as HSBC North America, to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. This change, which took effect April 1, 2020, will remain in place until at least March 31, 2021 and is designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households. The federal banking agencies have also issued a final rule that permits depository institutions such as HSBC Bank USA to exclude temporarily U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the denominator of their SLR. This change took effect June 1, 2020 and will remain in place until March 31, 2021 although it may be extended if the adverse economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic persist.
We manage capital in accordance with HSBC Group policy. The HSBC North America Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ("ICAAP") works in conjunction with the HSBC Group's ICAAP. The HSBC North America ICAAP applies to HSBC Bank USA and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios. Our approach is to
HSBC USA Inc.
meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk. To the extent that local alternatives are insufficient, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, we would seek support from our ultimate parent. Regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held, plus applicable capital buffers, as defined by regulations, and the amount of risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure, also calculated based on regulatory definitions.
We are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel III (the "Basel III rule"). The Basel III rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies ("BHCs"). In 2019, the FRB and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act ("Relief Act") that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large BHC and foreign banking organizations (the "Tailoring Rules"). The Tailoring Rules assign each BHC and IHC with $50 billion or more in total U.S. assets into one of five classifications (Categories I through IV, and 'other firms') based on its size and four risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are subject to Category III standards beginning with March 31, 2020 reporting. For additional discussion of the Basel III final rule requirements, including required minimum capital ratios, as well as further discussion of the Tailoring Rules and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K. We continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing The FRB requires certain U.S. top-tier BHCs and IHCs, including HSBC North America, to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and CCAR program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and annual company-run stress tests as required under Dodd-Frank (collectively, "DFAST"). Disclosure of the company-run stress tests is required only every other year. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB (and internally developed scenarios for the company-run exercises) on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a CCAR firm over a nine quarter planning horizon. For further discussion of capital planning and stress testing, including detail regarding the FRB's supervisory assessment as part of the CCAR process, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements," in this Form 10-K.
HSBC North America submitted its 2020 CCAR capital plan and its 2020 annual company-run DFAST results in April 2020. In July 2020, HSBC North America publicly disclosed its 2020 annual DFAST results.
In June 2020, the FRB publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results along with aggregated results of a sensitivity analysis aimed at gauging the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CCAR firms. Each CCAR firm, including HSBC North America, was required to resubmit its capital plan in November 2020 based on additional economic scenarios provided by the FRB to assess the potential impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On December 18, 2020, the FRB released certain information related to this second round of bank stress tests, and indicated that it is extending, through March 31, 2021, the time period for notifying CCAR firms, including HSBC North America, whether the FRB will recalculate a firm's stress capital buffer. The FRB also announced it is limiting CCAR firms' distributions in the first quarter of 2021. Under these restrictions, IHCs, such as HSBC North America, may make certain capital distributions in the first quarter of 2021, provided that the distributions paid in the final three quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, in the aggregate, do not exceed the amount of net income the IHC has earned in the preceding four calendar quarters. Stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of HSBC North America. Capital planning and stress testing for HSBC North America may impact our future capital and liquidity.
While BHC regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the HSBC North America level, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA, as a BHC we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the FRB. We present our capital ratios, together with HSBC Bank USA's in Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
HSBC USA Inc. HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, and the parent company of HSBC Bank USA and other subsidiaries through which we offer commercial and consumer banking products and related financial services, including derivatives, liquidity and cash management, trade finance and investment solutions. HSBC USA's main source of funds is cash received from financing activities, primarily through debt issuance to third parties and affiliates. In addition, it receives cash from affiliates by issuing preferred stock, from subsidiaries in the form of dividends and from its parent by receiving capital contributions when necessary.
HSBC USA received cash dividends from its subsidiaries of $121 million and $138 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, HSBC USA did not receive any cash capital contributions from its parent, HSBC North America.
HSBC USA has a number of obligations to meet with its available cash. It must be able to service its debt and meet the capital needs of its subsidiaries. It also must pay dividends on its preferred stock and may pay dividends on its common stock. HSBC USA paid dividends on its preferred stock totaling $77 million in both 2020 and 2019. HSBC USA did not pay any dividends
HSBC USA Inc.
on its common stock during either 2020 or 2019. We may pay dividends in the future, but will maintain our capital at levels consistent with our regulatory requirements, risk appetite and internal capital adequacy process.
At various times, we will make capital contributions to our subsidiaries to comply with regulatory guidance, support receivable growth, maintain acceptable investment grade ratings at the subsidiary level, or provide funding for long-term facilities and technology improvements. During 2020 and 2019, HSBC USA did not make any capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA.
As of December 31, 2020, HSBC Bank USA has sufficient undivided profits on hand from which to source contractual dividends, however prior OCC approval must be sought for the declaration and payment of dividends because cumulative net income for 2018 through 2020 was impacted by a net loss in 2020 driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the impairment of the goodwill previously allocated to our RBWM and PB reporting units and an increase to the provision for credit losses. Any reduction of permanent capital of HSBC Bank USA would also require OCC approval, as consistent with prior practice. See Note 25, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. In determining the extent of dividends to pay, HSBC Bank USA must also consider the effect of dividend payments on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of federal regulatory agencies that indicate banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Subsidiaries At December 31, 2020, we had one major subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA. We manage substantially all of our operations through HSBC Bank USA, which contributes to the funding of our businesses primarily through receiving deposits from customers; the collection of receivable balances; issuing short-term, medium-term and long-term debt and selling residential mortgage loans. The vast majority of our domestic medium-term notes and long-term debt is marketed through subsidiaries of HSBC. Intermediate and long-term debt may also be marketed through unaffiliated investment banks.
2021 Funding Strategy Our current estimate for funding needs and sources for 2021 are summarized in the following table:
The above table reflects a long-term funding strategy. Daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs, while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile. Should market conditions deteriorate, we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions. We remain confident in our ability to access the market for long-term debt funding needs in the current market environment. We continue to seek well-priced and stable customer deposits. We also continue to sell new agency-eligible mortgage loan originations to third parties.
HSBC Bank USA is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other 'covered transactions' with HSBC USA and other affiliates. For further discussion, see Part I, "Regulation and Competition - Affiliate Transaction Restrictions," in this Form 10-K.
See "Risk Management" in this MD&A for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management.
Capital Expenditures We made capital expenditures of $24 million and $62 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition to these amounts, during 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $93 million and $122 million, respectively, relating to improving and modernizing our business systems.
Commitments See "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations" in this MD&A for further information on our various commitments.
HSBC USA Inc.
Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes our long-term contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2020 by period due:
(1)Represents expected future payments related to our long-term debt instruments included in Note 14, "Long-Term Debt," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(2)Represents estimated future employee benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years based on assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at December 31, 2020. See Note 21, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(3)Represents expected future payments related to our operating lease liabilities included in Note 11, "Leases," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(4)Represents binding agreements for mortgage servicing, credit card servicing, lockbox services, advertising and other services.
These cash obligations could be funded primarily through cash collections on loans and from the issuance of new unsecured debt or receipt of deposits.
The pension obligation for our employees are the contractual obligation of HSBC North America and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations
As part of our normal operations, we enter into credit derivatives and various off-balance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties. These arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and, in certain cases, guarantees.
As a financial services provider, we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees, including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee.
The following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and off-balance sheet arrangements. Many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default. In addition, implementation of our business strategy (as described under the heading "Executive Overview - 2020 Events") will affect our contractual obligations over time, including with respect to credit derivatives. As a result, we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements.
(1)Includes $1,836 million and $1,623 million issued for the benefit of HSBC affiliates at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)Includes $13,550 million and $18,391 million issued for the benefit of HSBC affiliates at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(3)Includes $2,475 million and $1,302 million issued for the benefit of HSBC affiliates at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
HSBC USA Inc.
Letters of Credit A letter of credit may be issued for the benefit of a customer, authorizing a third party to draw on the letter for specified amounts under certain terms and conditions. We issue commercial and standby letters of credit.
•A commercial letter of credit is drawn down on the occurrence of an expected underlying transaction, such as the delivery of goods. Upon the occurrence of the transaction, the amount drawn under the commercial letter of credit is recorded as a receivable from the customer in other assets and as a liability to the vendor in other liabilities until settled.
•A standby letter of credit is issued to third parties for the benefit of a customer and is essentially a guarantee that the customer will perform, or satisfy some obligation, under a contract. It irrevocably obligates us to pay a third party beneficiary when a customer either: (1) in the case of a performance standby letter of credit, fails to perform some contractual non-financial obligation, or (2) in the case of a financial standby letter of credit, fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument. See Note 27, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to standby letter of credit off-balance sheet guarantee arrangements.
Credit Derivatives Credit derivative contracts are entered into both for our own benefit and to satisfy the needs of our customers. Credit derivatives are arrangements where one party (the "beneficiary") transfers the credit risk of a reference asset to another party (the "guarantor"). Under this arrangement the guarantor assumes the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly owning it. The beneficiary agrees to pay to the guarantor a specified fee. In return, the guarantor agrees to reimburse the beneficiary an agreed amount if there is a default to the reference asset during the term of the contract.
We offset most of the market risk by entering into a buy-protection credit derivative contract with another counterparty. Credit derivatives, although having characteristics of a guarantee, are accounted for as derivative instruments and are carried at fair value. The commitment amount included in the table above is the maximum amount that we could be required to pay, without consideration of the approximately equal amount receivable from third parties and any associated collateral. See Note 27, "Guarantee Arrangements, Pledged Assets and Repurchase Agreements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of credit derivative off-balance sheet guarantee arrangements.
Other Commitments to Extend Credit Other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans, participations in loans, lease financing receivables, or similar transactions. Consumer commitments comprise certain unused MasterCard/Visa credit card lines, where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer, and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties, where we have the right to change terms or conditions, for cause, upon notification to the customer. Commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit.
In addition to the above, we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value ("CNAV") money market funds that invest in shorter-dated highly-rated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment. These funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis, which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price. The funds, however, are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than 50 basis points from the portfolio's market value. In that case, the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price. We do not consolidate the CNAV funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the fund's assets, including interest rate, liquidity, credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets.
Fair Value
Fair Value Hierarchy Fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability (the "Fair Value Framework"). The Fair Value Framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants' assumptions. It emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs. For financial instruments carried at fair value, the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market (Level 1). Where the market for a financial instrument is not active, valuation techniques are used. The majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument (Level 2). Because Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are determined by observable inputs, less judgment is applied in determining their fair values. In the absence of observable market inputs, the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve. We consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy:
•whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price;
HSBC USA Inc.
•the level of bid-ask spreads;
•a lack of pricing transparency due to, among other things, complexity of the product and market liquidity;
•whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time;
•whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services;
•whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data; and
•whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value.
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. A financial instrument is classified as a Level 1 measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume. We regard financial instruments such as debt securities, equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded. Non-exchange-traded instruments classified as Level 1 assets include securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, to-be-announced securities, non-callable securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign government-backed debt.
Level 2 inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as Level 1 inputs. We classify mortgage pass-through securities, agency and certain non-agency mortgage collateralized obligations, non-exchange-traded derivative contracts, asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate debt securities, certain foreign government-backed debt, preferred securities, securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements, precious metals, certain loans held for sale, residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, real estate owned and, beginning January 1, 2020, certain student loans held for investment as Level 2 measurements. Where possible, at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments. We have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and, where appropriate, this pricing data is back-tested to market trade executions. Where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value, we investigate and reconcile the differences. If the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value, the instrument will be classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. In general, we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a non-derivative instrument.
Level 2 derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity. The fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the OTC market. Appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability. That is, Level 3 inputs incorporate market participants' assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk. We develop Level 3 inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our Level 3 measurements included the following: certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit, foreign exchange or equity derivatives that have significant unobservable inputs (e.g., volatility or default correlations), asset-backed credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable, certain asset-backed securities, individually assessed commercial loans, derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of Visa Class B Shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation and, at December 31, 2019, certain corporate debt securities. See Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on Level 3 inputs.
HSBC USA Inc.
Level 3 Measurements The following table provides information about Level 3 assets/liabilities in relation to total assets/liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)Presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met.
(2)Includes $838 million of recurring Level 3 assets and $273 million of non-recurring Level 3 assets at December 31, 2020. Includes $925 million of recurring Level 3 assets and $424 million of non-recurring Level 3 assets at December 31, 2019.
(3)Includes $97,975 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $658 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2020. Includes $97,866 million of assets measured on a recurring basis and $456 million of assets measured on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2019.
Significant Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities In 2020, one of our unconsolidated VIEs was unwound and our investment in the VIE along with the related derivatives were terminated. Our investment in the VIE, which was a level 3 asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis, had a carrying value of $501 million at the time of unwind. See Note 26, "Variable Interest Entities," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
See Note 28, "Fair Value Measurements," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into (out of) Level 3 measurements during 2020 and 2019 as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Effect of Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs The fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by, derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent. Changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements, the final valuation inputs selected are based on management's best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities.
The unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures. When we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time, it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $8 million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately $10 million at December 31, 2020. The effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain deal-contingent forward starting interest rate derivatives.
Risk Management
Overview Managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities.
Our risk management framework We use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture. This framework fosters continuous monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decision-making. It also ensures a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities.
Our risk culture refers to norms, attitudes and behaviors related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. We have long recognized the importance of a strong risk management culture, the fostering of which is a key responsibility of senior executives. Our risk culture is reinforced by our values and principles. It is instrumental in aligning the behaviors of individuals with our attitude to assuming and managing risk, which helps to ensure that our risk profile remains in line with our risk appetite. We use clear and consistent employee communication on risk to convey strategic messages and set the tone from senior management and the Board of Directors. We also deploy mandatory training on risk and compliance topics to embed skills and understanding in order to strengthen our risk culture and reinforce the attitude to risk in the behavior expected of employees, as described in our risk policies. We operate a global whistleblowing platform, HSBC Confidential, allowing staff to report matters of concern confidentially. Our risk culture is also reinforced by our approach to remuneration. Individual
HSBC USA Inc.
awards, including those for senior executives, are based on compliance with our values and the achievement of financial and non-financial objectives, which are aligned to our risk appetite and strategy.
Maintaining a conservative risk profile is a core part of our philosophy. This philosophy encompasses: maintaining a strong capital position defined by regulatory and internal capital ratios; having effective liquidity and funding management; generating returns that are in line with risk taken; and maintaining a sustainable and diversified earnings mix, delivering consistent returns. Additionally, we have zero tolerance for the following:
•knowingly engaging in any business, activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated;
•deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers arising from our products, services or operations or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements; and
•inappropriate market conduct by a member of our staff or by any of our lines of business.
Risk governance Our Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk. It is advised on risk matters by the Risk Committee and the Compliance and Conduct Committee ("CCC") of the Board of Directors. In particular, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors advises the Board of Directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy, risk governance and internal controls as well as high-level risk related matters. Robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk.
Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of the risk management framework resides with the HSBC North America Chief Risk Officer ("CRO") who is supported by the Risk Management Meeting of the HSBC USA Executive Committee ("RMM"). The management of financial crime risk resides with the U.S. Head of Financial Crime and Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") Officer who is supported by the Financial Crime Risk Management Committee. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated to senior managers with individual accountability for decision making.
Our responsibilities All employees are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their role as part of the Three Lines of Defense ("LoD") model. This model delineates management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment, and underpins our approach to risk management by clarifying responsibilities, encouraging collaboration and enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. Under the Three LoD model, the First LoD owns the risks and is responsible for identifying, recording, reporting and managing them in line with risk appetite, and ensuring that the right controls and assessments are in place to mitigate them. The Second LoD sets the policy and guidelines for managing specific risk areas, provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk, and challenges the First LoD on effective risk management. The Third LoD is our Internal Audit function, which provides independent assurance that our risk management, governance and internal control processes are designed and operating effectively.
The principle of individual accountability is exercised across the organization and is fundamental to risk ownership and risk management. Decisions are not taken by committees, but by specific individuals, in accordance with the Three LoD model, to promote clear ownership of decisions. The Board of Directors and its committees remain collective decision-making bodies. All employees are required to identify, assess and manage risk within the scope of their assigned responsibilities and, as such, they are critical to the effectiveness of the Three LoD model.
Risk function Our Risk function, headed by the CRO, is responsible for our risk management framework. This responsibility includes establishing policies, monitoring risk profiles and forward-looking risk identification and management. Our Risk function is made up of sub-functions covering all risks to our business. The Risk function forms part of the Second LoD. It is independent from our lines of business, including sales and trading functions, to provide challenge, appropriate oversight and balance in risk/reward decisions. The CRO reports to the HSBC North America Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and to the HSBC Group CRO. Executive accountability for the ongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of risk management policies resides with the CRO, supported by the RMM.
Specific oversight of various risk management processes occurs through the following meetings:
•the Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO");
•the Financial Crime Risk Management Committee ("FCRMC");
•the Reputational Risk and Client Selection Committees ("RRCSCs"); and
•Line of Business ("LoB") risk management and oversight meetings.
Each of these committees, as well as the RMM, have separate charters which detail their respective roles and responsibilities.
HSBC USA Inc.
The ALCO provides oversight of all capital, liquidity, interest rate and market risk and is chaired by the HUSI Chief Financial Officer. ALCO sets the limits of acceptable risk, monitors the adequacy of the tools used to measure risk and assesses the adequacy of reporting. In managing these risks, we seek to protect both our income stream and the value of our assets. ALCO also conducts contingency planning with regard to liquidity.
The FCRMC is the formal governance committee set up to ensure effective management of financial crime risk and to support the CEO in carrying out his financial crime risk responsibilities. Additionally, the U.S. Head of Financial Crime, who serves as the designated BSA Compliance Officer for HUSI, is the delegated chair of the FCRMC.
The RRCSC structure ensures appropriate consideration of customers and transactions that may adversely affect our public perception. RRCSCs exist in each business and comprise senior members from the business, risk, legal, financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties. The RRCSCs provide decision-making and guidance in respect of reputational risks and customer selection matters, and are responsible for ensuring that issues are appropriately tracked and resolved.
The LoB risk management and oversight meetings provide recommendations and advice, as requested, to their respective LoB senior management teams in the exercise of their powers, authorities and discretions in relation to the enterprise-wide management of all risks within or impacting their respective businesses.
Enterprise-wide risk management tools We use a range of tools to identify, monitor and manage risk. The key enterprise-wide risk management tools are summarized below:
•Risk appetite - The CRO oversees the development of our risk appetite which defines, shapes and monitors our risk profile. The HSBC North America Risk Appetite Statement ("RAS") is a written articulation of the aggregate level and types of risk that we are willing to accept in order to achieve our strategic business objectives. HSBC North America's conservative risk profile is articulated in the qualitative section of the RAS, which serves as guidance to embed risk appetite and supports strategic and operational decision making at HUSI. The quantitative section of the RAS contains a set of key metrics covering both financial and non-financial risks. Non-financial risk is defined as the risk to achieving our strategy or objectives as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
Performance against the RAS metrics is monitored by senior management and reported to the RMM and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors on a periodic basis, enabling senior management to monitor the risk profile and guide business activity to balance risk and return. All breaches of risk appetite thresholds are escalated and actions to remediate the breaches are documented. This process helps to embed a strong risk culture across our businesses. The risk appetite profile is one of the key tools in the wider enterprise risk management framework, which drives the core of our active risk management. The risk appetite profile is aligned to strategic and financial planning and therefore provides a top down view of risk and return objectives. Performance that falls outside of risk appetite is highlighted and appropriate mitigation actions are determined.
•Risk map - We utilize a risk map to provide a point-in-time view of our residual risk profile across a range of both financial and non-financial risk categories, including our principal banking risks. It assesses the potential of these risks to have a material impact on our financial results, reputation or sustainability of our business. Risks that have an 'amber' or 'red' rating require a rating justification to outline the key issues and monitoring and mitigating action plans to be in place to manage the risk down to acceptable levels.
•Top and emerging risks - We use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forward-looking view of risks with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations. The top and emerging risks framework enables us to take action which either stop these risks from materializing or limit their impact. We proactively assess the internal and external risk environment as well as review the themes identified across our businesses and functions to update our top and emerging risks as necessary. We define a 'top risk' as a thematic issue that may arise across any number of risk map categories or businesses and crystallize within a one-year time horizon and that has the potential to materially affect our financial results, reputation or business model. The impact of a 'top risk' may be well understood by senior management and some mitigating actions may already be in place. An 'emerging risk' is a thematic issue with large unknown components that may form and crystallize beyond a one-year time horizon. If it were to materialize, it could have a material effect on our long-term strategy, profitability and/or reputation. Existing mitigating plans for an 'emerging risk' are likely to be minimal, reflecting the uncertain nature of these risks at this stage.
•Risk identification - Risk identification is a tool that allows us to provide a holistic view of risks facing the organization stemming from our unique business activities and associated exposures, including those that are difficult to quantify or only materialize under stressful conditions. The process is integrated with and built upon existing risk management tools such as top and emerging risk reporting as well as risk and control assessments. The risk identification process takes place on a quarterly basis and involves senior representatives from the First and Second LoD. Senior management governance is provided by the RMM with results presented to the Risk Committee of the
HSBC USA Inc.
Board of Directors on an annual basis. Material risks identified are actively monitored and used to inform key aspects of our capital planning and stress testing program.
•Stress testing - Stress testing is an important tool we use to assess potential vulnerabilities in our businesses, business model or portfolios. We operate a comprehensive stress testing program that supports our risk management and capital planning processes. It includes execution of stress tests mandated by our regulators, is supported by dedicated teams and infrastructure, and is overseen by senior management. It demonstrates our capital strength and enhances our resilience to external shocks. It allows us to understand the sensitivities of the core assumptions in our strategic and capital plans and improve decision making through balancing risk and return. In addition to taking part in regulators' stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress tests. Internal stress test scenarios are closely aligned to our assessment of top and emerging risks and help inform risk appetite thresholds. These may prompt management actions, including a reduction in limits or direct exposures, or closer monitoring of exposures sensitive to stress.
•Models - In the course of our regular risk management activities, we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking. The output from some of these models is included in this section of our filing. By their nature, models are based on various assumptions and relationships. We believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate, but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models. In actual stressed market conditions, these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold, causing actual experience to differ significantly from the results predicted in the model. Consequently, actual results may differ significantly from model projections.
The severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current COVID-19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built. As a result, adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results. Where models do not require adjustments, enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended.
Key developments in 2020 In 2020, we actively managed the risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our customers and operations. We maintained high levels of service as our people, processes and systems responded to the required changes. To meet the additional challenges, we increased our focus on the quality and the timeliness of the data used to inform management decisions through measures such as early warning indicators, prudent and active management of our risk appetite and ensuring regular communication with our stakeholders. We continued to evolve our risk appetite by allocating resources to ensure we remained able to support our customers and our strategic goals. The financial impact of COVID-19 requires close monitoring. We conducted reviews of our portfolios that are highly vulnerable to general economic conditions and additional review measures have been implemented for new credit requests. We actively managed our capital and liquidity position to ensure we had the capacity to provide increasing levels of financial support to our customers. We also conducted a range of internal stress tests during 2020 including stress tests covering several potential COVID-19 related outcomes to assess the resilience of key balance sheet metrics including capital adequacy and liquidity. Our balance sheet and capital adequacy remain resilient based on these tests.
Also in 2020, we undertook a number of key initiatives to enhance our approach to the management of risk, including:
•We further simplified our approach and articulation of risk management through the combination of our enterprise risk management framework and our operational risk management framework.
•We continued to focus on simplifying our approach to non-financial risk management. We are driving more effective oversight and better end-to-end identification and management of non-financial risks.
•In response to a continually evolving threat landscape that the wider industry faces within non-financial risk, we formed a new Operational & Resilience Risk combined sub-function. See "Resilience Risk Management" below for further discussion.
•We updated our risk taxonomy to combine interest rate risk with capital and liquidity risk into a new category named treasury risk. The Second LoD for the Markets Treasury function was also re-named Treasury Risk Management ("TRM"). TRM will oversee treasury risk-related activities including capital, liquidity and funding, and interest rate risk. Through these changes we expect to be better able to effectively manage treasury risk across HUSI.
Our material risks The principal risks associated with our operations include the following:
•Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract;
•Treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital, liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements, including pension risk. Treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates;
•Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios;
HSBC USA Inc.
•Resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption;
•Regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards of good market practice, which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business;
•Financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity, including money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions breaches, and terrorist and proliferation financing;
•Strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify, execute and react appropriately to opportunities and/or threats arising from changes in the market, some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances, customer requirements, demographic trends, regulatory developments or competitor action; and
•Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models, which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology, design or the way they are used.
Credit Risk Management Credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers. Credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities.
The principle objectives of credit risk management are to:
•maintain a strong culture of responsible lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks;
•both partner with and challenge our businesses in defining, implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions; and
•ensure there is independent scrutiny of credit risks, their cost and their mitigation.
Credit risk arises from various on- and off-balance sheet instruments and arrangements, such as:
•loan portfolios;
•investment portfolios;
•unfunded commitments such as letters of credit and lines of credit and unutilized credit card lines that customers can draw upon; and
•derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, which may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract.
While credit risk exists widely in our operations, diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure. Day-to-day management of credit and market risk is performed by the Chief Credit Officer/Head of Wholesale Credit and Market Risk North America and the HSBC North America WPB Chief Risk Officer, who report directly to the CRO and maintain independent risk functions. The credit risk associated with wholesale commercial portfolios is managed by the Chief Credit Officer, while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios, such as residential mortgages, credit cards and installment loans, is managed by the WPB Chief Risk Officer. Further discussion of credit risk, including risk associated with cross-border exposures, can be found under the "Credit Quality" caption in this MD&A.
Our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles, including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. The Credit Risk function continues to refine "early warning" indicators and reporting, including stress testing scenarios on the basis of recent experience. Stress testing results are taken into consideration within our business planning process. Action has been taken, where necessary, to improve our resilience to risks associated with the current market conditions by selectively discontinuing business lines or products, closely managing underwriting criteria and investing in improved fraud prevention technologies. In addition, as a result of market volatility and economic uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, we re-reviewed the credit ratings assigned to substantially all of our material commercial loans during the first half of 2020. During the second half of 2020, we continued to monitor the performance as conditions evolved and took necessary credit actions where warranted.
The responsibilities of the Credit Risk function include:
•Formulating credit risk policies - Our policies are designed to ensure that all of our various retail and wholesale business units operate within clear standards of acceptable credit risk. Our policies ensure that the HSBC standards are consistently implemented across all businesses and that all regulatory requirements are also considered. Credit policies are reviewed and approved annually at the RMM and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
•Approving new credit exposures and independently assessing large exposures annually - Credit approval authorities are delegated by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors to the CRO with the authority to sub-delegate to the
HSBC USA Inc.
Chief Credit Officer and WPB Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer and WPB Chief Risk Officer in turn delegate limited credit authority to the various lending units. However, most wholesale credits are reviewed and approved centrally through a dedicated Credit Approval Unit that reports directly to the Chief Credit Officer. In addition, the Chief Credit Officer coordinates the review of material credits with the HSBC Group Credit Risk which, subject to certain agreed-upon limits, will concur on material new and renewal transactions. Large retail credits are escalated to the WPB Chief Risk Officer for review and concurrence.
•Overseeing retail credit and collateral risk - The WPB Chief Risk Officer manages the credit and collateral risk associated with retail portfolios, supported by expertise from a dedicated advanced risk analytics unit. Collateral risk in retail arises when the underlying value of the property securing a retail loan loses value due to macroeconomic, housing market or industry conditions. This risk is actively managed through on-going monitoring of House Price Indices in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas in which the mortgage portfolio is concentrated. In areas where property values are declining, maximum loan to value requirements will be adjusted downward to compensate for this risk.
•Maintaining and developing the governance and operation of the wholesale risk rating system - A two-dimensional credit risk rating system is utilized in order to categorize exposures meaningfully and enable focused management of the risks involved. This rating system comprises a 23 category customer risk rating, which considers the probability of default of an obligor and a separate assessment of a transaction's potential loss given default. Each credit grade has a probability of default estimate. Rating methodologies are based upon a wide range of analytics and market data-based tools, which are core inputs to the assessment of counterparty risk. Although automated risk rating processes are increasingly used, for larger facilities the ultimate responsibility for setting risk grades rests in each case with the final approving executive. Risk grades are reviewed frequently and amendments, where necessary, are implemented promptly.
•Measuring portfolio credit risk - We continue to advance the measurement of the risk in our credit portfolios using techniques such as stress testing in certain internal reporting. Efforts continue to refine both the inputs and assumptions used to increase the usefulness in the evaluation of large and small commercial and retail customer portfolio products and business unit return on risk.
•Monitoring portfolio performance - Credit data warehouses have been implemented to centralize the reporting of credit risk, support the analysis of risk and to calculate credit loss reserves. This data warehouse also supports HSBC's wider effort to meet the requirements of Basel III and to generate credit reports for management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
•Establishing counterparty and portfolio limits - We monitor and limit our wholesale exposure to individual counterparties and to the combined exposure of related counterparties. In addition, selected industry portfolios, such as real estate, are subject to caps that are recommended by the Chief Credit Officer and reviewed where appropriate by management committees and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Retail establishes portfolio limits by product as well as limits on new products and higher-risk segments such as investment property, high LTV mortgages and credit cards. These limits are approved by the WPB Chief Risk Officer and monitored by a retail credit risk management committee. Counterparty credit exposure related to derivative activities is also managed under approved limits. Since the exposure related to derivatives is variable and uncertain, internal risk management methodologies are used to calculate the 95 percent worst-case potential future exposure for each customer. These methodologies take into consideration, among other factors, cross-product close-out netting, collateral received from customers under collateral support annexes, termination clauses, and off-setting positions within the portfolio.
•Managing problem loans - Special attention is paid to problem loans. When appropriate, our wholesale Loan Management Unit and retail Collection and Recovery teams provide customers with intensive management and support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible and maximize recoveries.
•Establishing allowances for credit losses - The Chief Credit Officer and the WPB Chief Risk Officer share responsibility with the Chief Financial Officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost.
On January 1, 2020, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" ("ASU 2016-13"). The implementation of ASU 2016-13 represents a significant challenge to our Risk and Finance functions. The ASU introduces new concepts and measures such as lifetime ECL. Some of these new concepts and measures differ significantly from the IFRS 9, "Financial Instruments" ("IFRS 9") credit loss reporting that we implemented in 2018 for segment reporting under the Group Reporting Basis. As a result of ASU 2016-13 adoption, management has additional insight and measures not previously utilized which, over time, may influence our risk appetite and risk management processes.
The ASU 2016-13 process comprises three main areas:
•Modeling - The Risk function had pre-existing models developed in conjunction with our IFRS 9 reporting to HSBC. These models were enhanced or supplemented to address the requirements of ASU 2016-13 such as incorporating
HSBC USA Inc.
forward economic guidance for a reasonable and supportable forecast period, reversion to historical losses, the expectation for zero losses under certain conditions, and lifetime ECL for undrawn credit exposures, with the appropriate governance and independent review. The models vary in complexity and inputs depending upon the size of the portfolio, the amount of data available and the sophistication of the market concerned.
•Implementation - A centralized impairment engine has been implemented to perform the lifetime ECL calculation. The impairment engine receives data, which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements, from a variety of client, finance and risk systems. Once the lifetime ECL calculation has been performed, there are further data analysis checks and review and challenge of the results prior to commencing formal governance. Risk and Finance work closely together throughout the execution of this process.
•Governance - Management review committees have been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ECL calculations. The management review committees have representatives from Credit Risk and Finance and are responsible for final approval of our lifetime ECL for the period.
Sustainability risk is a component of credit risk and represents the risk that financial services provided to customers indirectly result in unacceptable impacts on people or on the environment. We measure sustainability risk by assessing the potential sustainability impacts of a customer's activities and assigning a sustainability risk rating. Sustainability risk is monitored by the businesses and the Credit Approval Unit, as well as HSBC Group Sustainability Risk, who are actively responsible for developing policies, guidance, processes and training. Sustainability Risk Managers in the Wholesale Credit Risk function, with input from HSBC Group Sustainability Risk, are responsible for advising our businesses on managing environmental and social risks. The Wholesale Credit Risk function's responsibilities in relation to sustainability risk include:
•overseeing our sustainability risk standards, our application of the Equator Principles and our sustainability policies (covering agricultural commodities, chemicals, defense, energy, forestry, mining and metals, Ramsar Wetlands and UNESCO World Heritage Sites);
•undertaking an independent review of transactions, including escalating transactions to HSBC Group Sustainability Risk where sustainability risks are assessed to be high and approving transactions where sustainability risks are of a lower magnitude; and
•providing training and capacity building within our businesses to ensure sustainability risks are identified and mitigated consistently.
Credit Review is an independent and critical Second LoD function. Its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business. Credit Review will focus on the review and evaluation of wholesale and retail lending activities and will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios. Credit Review will independently assess the business units and risk management functions to ensure the portfolios are managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with HSBC Group strategy, risk appetite, appropriate local and HSBC Group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. For example, this includes the unilateral authority to independently assess and revise customer risk ratings, facility grades and loss given default estimates. To ensure its independent stature, the Credit Review Delegation of Authority is endorsed by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors which grants the Head of Credit Review unhindered access to the Risk Committee and executive sessions at the discretion of the Head of Credit Review. Accordingly, our Risk Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of the Credit Review annual and ongoing plan, quarterly plan updates and results of reviews.
Treasury Risk Management Treasury risk arises from changes to the respective resources and risk profiles driven by customer behavior, management decisions or the external environment.
Capital risk is the risk that we fail to meet our regulatory capital requirements. Capital risk arises from a deterioration in the capital base due to losses and increased risk profile from management activity or the external environment. We aim to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy, meeting regulatory capital requirements at all times. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&A for a full discussion of our approach to capital risk management, including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements.
Liquidity and funding risk is the risk that we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or that we cannot raise funding or can only do so at excessive cost. Liquidity and funding risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows or when illiquid asset positions cannot be funded at the expected terms and when required. We continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our liquidity and funding framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices. Historically, we have seen the greatest strain in the wholesale market as opposed to the retail market (the latter being the market from which we source stable demand and time deposit accounts which are less sensitive to market events or changes in interest rates).
Liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to meet lending, deposit withdrawal and other commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence. Market funding is
HSBC USA Inc.
coordinated with other HSBC Group entities, as the markets increasingly view debt issuances from the separate companies within the context of our common parent company. Liquidity and funding risk management is performed at the HSBC North America, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA levels. Each entity is required to have sufficient liquidity for a crisis situation.
ALCO develops and implements policies and procedures to ensure that the minimum liquidity ratios and a strong overall liquidity position are maintained. ALCO projects cash flow requirements and determines the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal, with consideration given to anticipated deposit and balance sheet growth, contingent liabilities, and the ability to access wholesale funding markets. In addition to base case projections, multiple stress scenarios are generated to simulate crisis conditions, including:
•run-off of non-stable deposits;
•inability to renew maturing interbank funding;
•draw-downs of committed loan facilities;
•decreases in the market value of liquid securities;
•additional collateral requirements for derivative transactions under existing collateral support agreements;
•rating downgrades of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA; and
•increased discount on security values for repos or disposals.
In addition, ALCO monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships.
As part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management, we employ the measures discussed below to define, monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with HSBC policy.
The Basel Committee based Liquidity Coverage Ratio ("LCR") is designed to be a short-term liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, HSBC USA's LCR under the European LCR rule exceeded 100 percent. A LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. HQLA consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are also subject to the U.S. LCR rule and are required to report their LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. The Tailoring Rules reduced the U.S. LCR requirement for Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion, including HSBC North America, and their depository institution subsidiaries, such as HSBC Bank USA, from 100 to 85 percent beginning January 1, 2020. As a result, under the U.S. LCR rule, a LCR of 100 percent or higher reflects an unencumbered HQLA balance that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of a Category III firm's liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. During 2020, HSBC Bank USA's LCR under the U.S. LCR rule remained above the 100 percent minimum requirement.
The European calibration of the Basel Committee based Net Stable Funding Ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities, is still pending. Therefore, our calculation of NSFR is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the Basel Committee NSFR guidance, which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the European calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators. The Basel NSFR guidance has been interpreted in certain instances to include expected changes from the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation, commonly referred to as "CRR2". Our calculation of NSFR will fully follow the CRR2 reporting rules when they are expected to become effective in June 2021. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, HSBC USA's estimated NSFR exceeded 100 percent. A NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. In October 2020, U.S. regulators issued a final rule to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, that will take effect July 1, 2021. Consistent with the Tailoring Rules, an 85 percent NSFR requirement will apply to Category III firms with weighted short-term wholesale funding under $75 billion, including HSBC North America, and their depository institution subsidiaries, such as HSBC Bank USA, when the final rule becomes effective July 1, 2021. As a result, under the U.S. NSFR rule, a NSFR of 100 percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next 12 months that is equal to or exceeds 85 percent of a Category III firm's required amount of funding for assets and off-balance sheet exposures. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, HSBC Bank USA's estimated NSFR, based on our interpretation and understanding of the U.S. NSFR rule, exceeded 100 percent.
As a Category III firm, HSBC North America remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules and will continue to evaluate the impact of the final U.S. NSFR rule on our operations.
HSBC USA Inc.
ALCO also maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan ("Contingency Funding Plan"), which identifies certain potential early warning indicators of liquidity problems, and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis, to minimize the long-term impact on our businesses and customer relationships. The Contingency Funding Plan is reviewed annually and approved by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us, relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner, or market-wide, caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system. A range of indicators are monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues. These include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility, material reductions or extreme volatility in customer deposit balances, increased utilization of credit lines, widening of our own credit spreads and higher borrowing costs. At the onset of a crisis, liquidity needs would be satisfied primarily with unsecured wholesale market funding. If the crisis escalates, contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through sales of securities from the investment portfolio and secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral. Securities may be sold or used as collateral in a repurchase agreement depending on the scenario. Portions of the mortgage portfolio may be used as collateral at the FHLB to increase borrowings. We maintain a Liquid Asset Buffer consisting of cash, short-term liquid assets and unencumbered government and other highly rated investment securities as a source of funding. Further, collateral is maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the FHLB, providing additional secured borrowing capacity in a liquidity crisis.
In addition to the oversight provided by ALCO, TRM is a Second LoD oversight function for treasury risk-related activities, including capital, liquidity and funding and interest rate risk, which independently reports into the CRO. TRM's primary mandate is to strengthen our treasury risk management framework through challenge and review of existing processes and recommending areas that need improvement to the RMM. TRM serves as an advisory function to senior management to ensure front line units with direct responsibility for managing treasury risk are operating within their operating guidelines and defined risk appetite parameters. The TRM oversight mandate is carried out through critical evaluation and challenge of existing risk management processes including stress testing and ratio calculations.
Our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits, supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet, and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans. In addition, regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of HQLA. As such, we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities.
Our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. The following table reflects the short and long-term credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA at December 31, 2020:
Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices and legal matters, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions.
In April 2020, Fitch changed its rating outlook for both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for HSBC. The outlook change reflects the economic disruption driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the outlook changed, Fitch affirmed its long-term credit rating for HSBC USA. Concurrently, Fitch upgraded its long-term credit rating for HSBC Bank USA by one notch to AA- following a review of HSBC's resolution plan.
In May 2020, S&P downgraded its long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA by one notch following a similar rating action for HSBC. The long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC USA were downgraded to A- and A-2, respectively, from A and A-1, respectively, while the long- and short-term issuer credit ratings of HSBC Bank USA were downgraded to A+ and A-1, respectively, from AA- and A-1+, respectively. These rating downgrades reflect S&P's view that the HSBC Group will not be fully shielded from the global economic downturn resulting from the measures taken against the spread of COVID-19 and that weaker earnings arising from higher credit charges will be exacerbated by low interest rates. S&P also noted HSBC Group's restructuring plan. In conjunction with these downgrades, S&P revised its rating outlooks for HSBC, HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA to stable from negative.
While these rating actions by Fitch and S&P did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity, any future actions could have such an impact. Although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit
HSBC USA Inc.
ratings, there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future. At December 31, 2020, there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of HSBC USA or HSBC Bank USA from any of the rating agencies.
Numerous factors, internal and external, may impact access to and costs associated with issuing debt in the global capital markets. These factors include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility and the effectiveness of the management of credit risks inherent in our customer base.
Cash resources, short-term investments and a trading asset portfolio are available to provide highly liquid funding for us. Additional liquidity is provided by available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities. Approximately $4,990 million of the debt securities in these portfolios at December 31, 2020 are expected to mature in 2021. The remaining $44,665 million of debt securities not expected to mature in 2021 are available to provide liquidity by serving as collateral for secured borrowings, or if needed, by being sold. Further liquidity is available through our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets. In 2020, we did not sell or securitize any residential mortgage loan portfolios other than the normal sales of agency-eligible mortgage loan originations.
It is the policy of HSBC Bank USA to maintain both primary and secondary collateral in order to ensure precautionary borrowing availability from the Federal Reserve Bank. Primary collateral is collateral that is physically maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank, and serves as a safety net against any unexpected funding shortfalls that may occur. Secondary collateral is collateral that is acceptable to the Federal Reserve Bank, but is not maintained there. If unutilized borrowing capacity were to be low, secondary collateral would be identified and maintained as necessary. Further liquidity is available from the FHLB.
See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&A for further discussion of our liquidity position, including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings, the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy.
Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet assets and liabilities. Specifically, as interest rates change, amounts of interest earning assets and liabilities fluctuate, and interest earning assets reprice at intervals that do not correspond to the maturities or repricing patterns of interest bearing liabilities. This mismatch between assets and liabilities in repricing sensitivity results in changes to projected net interest income as interest rates move. To help manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates, and to manage net interest income within interest rate risk ranges management considers acceptable, we use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, options, futures and forwards as hedges to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets, liabilities, forecasted transactions or firm commitments. Analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments, and from behavioral assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts. These assumptions around behavioral features are captured in our interest rate behavioralization framework, which is described further below. Day-to-day management of interest rate risk is centralized principally in Markets Treasury, which includes the non-trading interest rate risk positions transferred to it as discussed further under "Market Risk Management" below.
We have significant, but historically well controlled, interest rate risk in large part due to our portfolio of residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which consumers can prepay without penalty, and our large base of demand and savings deposits. These deposits can be withdrawn by consumers at will, but historically they have been a stable source of relatively low cost funds.
In addition, we have a considerable number of contracts referencing LIBOR. The process of adopting new reference rates may expose us to an increased level of financial risks, such as potential earnings volatility. See "Executive Overview" in this MD&A for a full discussion of our LIBOR transition.
In the course of managing interest rate risk, an economic value of equity ("EVE") analysis is utilized in conjunction with a combination of other risk assessment techniques to identify and assess the potential impact of interest rate movements and take appropriate action. This combination of techniques, with some focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on the valuation of the balance sheet (e.g. EVE, present value of a basis point ("PVBP"), repricing gap analysis, value at risk) and others focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on earnings (e.g. net interest income simulation modeling, basis risk analysis) allows for comprehensive analyses from different perspectives. Refer to "Market Risk Management" below for discussion regarding the use of value at risk analyses to monitor and manage interest rate risk.
A key element of managing interest rate risk is the management of the convexity of the balance sheet, largely resulting from the mortgage related products on the balance sheet. Convexity risk arises as mortgage loan consumers change their payment behavior significantly in response to large movements in market rates, but do not change behavior appreciably for smaller changes in market rates. Certain interest rate management tools, such as EVE and net interest income simulation modeling
HSBC USA Inc.
described below, better capture the embedded convexity in the balance sheet, while measures such as PVBP are designed to capture the risk of smaller changes in rates.
The assessment techniques discussed below act as a guide for managing interest rate risk associated with balance sheet composition and off-balance sheet hedging strategy (the risk position). Calculated values within limit ranges reflect an acceptable risk position, although possible future unfavorable trends may prompt adjustments to on or off-balance sheet exposure. Calculated values outside of limit ranges will result in consideration of adjustment of the risk position, or consideration of temporary dispensation from making adjustments.
Economic value of equity ("EVE") EVE represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed run-off scenario. An EVE sensitivity represents the change in EVE due to a defined movement in interest rates. We manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of 200 basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points to the market implied interest rates. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, our EVE remained within risk appetite for the up 200 and down 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios.
Repricing gap analysis The following table shows the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020. For assets and liabilities whose cash flows are subject to change due to movements in interest rates, such as the sensitivity of mortgage loans to prepayments, data is reported based on the earlier of expected repricing or maturity and reflects anticipated prepayments based on the current rate environment. The resulting "gaps" are reviewed to assess the potential sensitivity to earnings with respect to the direction, magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates. Data shown is as of year-end, and one-day figures can be distorted by temporary swings in assets or liabilities. The repricing structure of our assets and liabilities may be impacted by the implementation of our business strategy, which is described under the heading "Executive Overview."
(1) Includes loans held for sale
Various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets, liabilities and derivative contracts.
HSBC USA Inc.
Net interest income simulation modeling techniques We utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income. These techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios, such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by 100 basis points, as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by 100 basis points over a twelve month period. In the gradual scenarios, 25 percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter. The following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques:
Changes in the sensitivities since December 31, 2019 have been primarily driven by a significant increase in liquidity which was deployed into interest bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank and securities purchased under agreements to resell. In addition, the sensitivities in the 'down-shock' scenarios at December 31, 2020 reflect no floors to the shocked market rates as discussed further below.
Projected net interest income sensitivity figures represent the effect of movements in net interest income based on the projected yield curve scenarios and our current interest rate risk profile. This effect, however, does not incorporate actions which would probably be taken by Markets Treasury or in the businesses to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk. In reality, Markets Treasury seeks proactively to change the interest rate risk profile to minimize losses and optimize net revenues. The net interest income simulation modeling calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the 'up-shock' scenarios. The sensitivity calculations in the 'down-shock' scenarios reflect no floors to the shocked market rates. However, customer product-specific rate floors are recognized where appropriate. This is a change from the methodology published in our 2019 Form 10-K, where previously market rates would have been floored to zero when applicable. In addition, the net interest income simulation modeling calculations take account of the effect on net interest income of anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest rates and interest rates over which the entity has discretion in terms of the timing and extent of rate changes. The projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality, size and composition of the balance sheet. Therefore, although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity, actual results will differ from these estimates, possibly by significant amounts.
Interest rate risk behavioralization Unlike liquidity risk which is assessed on the basis of a very severe stress scenario, interest rate risk is assessed and managed according to business-as-usual conditions. In many cases the contractual profile of our assets and liabilities does not reflect the behavior observed.
Behavioralization is therefore used to assess the interest rate risk of our assets and liabilities and this assessed risk is transferred to Markets Treasury, in accordance with the rules governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global businesses to Markets Treasury.
Behavioralization is applied in three key areas:
•the assessed re-pricing frequency of managed rate balances;
•the assessed duration of non-interest bearing balances, typically capital and current accounts; and
•the base case expected prepayment behavior or pipeline take-up rate for fixed rate balances with embedded optionality.
Interest rate behavioralization policies have to be formulated in line with the HSBC Group's behavioralization policies and approved at least annually by ALCO and global Asset, Liability and Capital Management, in conjunction with local, regional and HSBC Group risk monitoring teams.
The extent to which balances can be behavioralized is driven by:
•the amount of the current balance that can be assessed as stable under business-as-usual conditions; and
•for managed rate balances the historic market interest rate re-pricing behavior observed; or
•for non-interest bearing balances the duration for which the balance is expected to remain under business-as-usual conditions. This assessment is often driven by the re-investment tenors available to Markets Treasury to neutralize the
HSBC USA Inc.
risk through the use of fixed rate government bonds or interest rate derivatives, and for derivatives the availability of cash flow hedging capacity.
Pension risk is a component of treasury risk and represents the risk of increased costs from offering post-employment benefit plans to our employees. Certain employees are eligible to participate in the HSBC North America qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen. While plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an over-funded status of approximately $305 million at December 31, 2020, changes in market conditions could result in an under-funded status occurring in future periods. Because these obligations relate to the HSBC North America pension plan, only a portion of any deficit could be considered our responsibility. We and other HSBC North America affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the Pension Protection Act. This can be accomplished through direct contributions, appreciation in plan assets and/or increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations. See Note 21, "Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the HSBC North America defined benefit plan.
Market Risk Management Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios:
•Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from market-making and warehousing of client-derived positions.
•Non-trading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.
We apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite.
The nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies performed corresponds to the market risk management instruments available. These strategies range from the use of traditional market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level.
Market risk governance Market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and the RMM, as well as the various businesses, and also ratified by the HSBC Group Risk Management Meeting. These limits are allocated across business lines and to the HSBC Group legal entities, including HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA.
We have an independent market risk management and control function in North America which is responsible for setting the risk appetite, measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by HSBC Group Risk, and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis.
Model risk is governed through model oversight committees at the regional and global Wholesale Credit and Market Risk levels. The Committees have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk models utilized for risk measurement and management and stress testing. They prioritize the development of models, methodologies and practices used for traded risk management and ensure that they remain within our risk appetite and business plans. We are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of our in-house risk models subject to regulatory approval. Refer to "Model Risk Management" below for further discussion regarding the management and monitoring of model risk across North America.
Our control of market risk in the trading and non-trading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments ultimately approved by HSBC Group Risk as well as enforcing new product approval procedures through a dedicated committee.
Market risk measures We use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures, including:
Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, for example the impact of a one basis point change in the yield curve. We use sensitivity analysis to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type. Sensitivity limits are set for portfolios, products and risk types, with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set.
Value at risk ("VaR") VaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. Where we do not calculate VaR explicitly, we use alternative tools as summarized in the 'Stress Testing' section below.
Our VaR models are predominantly based on historical simulation which incorporates the following features:
•historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and the associated volatilities;
•potential market movements utilized for VaR are calculated with reference to data from the past two years;
HSBC USA Inc.
•scenario profit and losses are calculated utilizing the market scenarios for all relevant risk factors; and
•VaR measures are calculated to a 99 percent confidence level and use a one-day holding period.
The models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in VaR without any changes in the underlying positions.
Although a valuable guide to risk, VaR should always be viewed in the context of its limitations. For example:
•the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events, particularly those which are extreme in nature;
•the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period, which may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity, when the holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully;
•the use of a 99 percent confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence; and
•VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intra-day exposures.
The risks not in VaR ("RNIV") framework aims to capture and capitalize material market risks that are not adequately covered in the VaR model. Risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either incorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or quantified through the RNIV. RNIV stresses interest rate basis risk exposure and interest rate volatility skewness. RNIV risk-weighted assets make up approximately 10 percent of HUSI market risk risk-weighted assets, though contribution to total HUSI risk-weighted assets remains immaterial.
Stressed VaR Stressed VaR is primarily used for regulatory capital purposes and is integrated into the risk management process to facilitate efficient capital management. Stressed VaR complements other risk measures by providing severe potential losses associated with stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR modeling follows the same approach as VaR, except Stressed VaR calculates potential loss at a 99 percent confidence level for a one-day holding period based on a one year historical period that is calibrated to the most volatile period for the trading portfolio.
Stress testing Stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables. In such scenarios, losses can be much greater than those predicted by VaR modeling.
A set of scenarios is used consistently across the HSBC Group. Scenarios are tailored to capture the relevant potential events or market movements at each level. The risk appetite around potential stress losses is set and monitored against corresponding limits.
The process is governed by the Stress Testing Review Group forum which, in conjunction with regional risk management, determines the scenarios to be applied. Main scenario types are as follows:
•single risk factor stress scenarios that are unlikely to be captured within the VaR models, such as the break of a currency peg;
•technical scenarios that incorporate the largest move in each risk factor independent from any underlying market correlation;
•hypothetical scenarios are mainly built on potential macroeconomic events, for example, the slowdown in mainland China and the potential effects of a sovereign debt default, including its wider contagion effects, curves steepening or flattening scenarios; and
•historical scenarios which incorporate past observations of market movements during periods of stress which are not captured within VaR.
Market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed loss. The stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss. The rationale behind the reverse stress test is to understand scenarios which are beyond normal business conditions and could have contagion and systemic implications.
Stressed VaR and stress testing, together with reverse stress testing, provide management with insights regarding the 'tail risk' beyond VaR, for which our appetite is limited.
Market risk in 2020 The global market environment was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences, paired with other geopolitical events.
The outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic drove volatility in financial markets and impacted both the global and U.S. economy. During the year, economic data deteriorated, showing vulnerabilities in the labor market, business margins, and
HSBC USA Inc.
corporate debt levels. In response to the global pandemic, governments have increased spending to support the economy with an associated increase in global debt.
United States and China tensions remained elevated due to continued structural trade imbalances between the countries, issues on intellectual property governance, early information and controlling of the COVID-19 spread, and geopolitical actions related to Hong Kong and Taiwan.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the United States authorized emergency use of coronavirus vaccines. The FRB closed the year holding rates steady and communicating that they would maintain the current large-scale bond buying. The U.S. election concluded with Democrats gaining the presidency and control of the Senate, while maintaining control of the House of Representatives.
A focus on the pace and strength of the recovery should be the significant theme in 2021. The beginning of the year should remain challenging as infection rates continue to rise across the United States coupled with a slower than anticipated distribution of vaccines which may continue the risk of localized lockdowns.
Trading portfolios Trading VaR generates from the Global Markets unit of the GBM business segment. Portfolios comprise mainly foreign exchange products, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and precious metals (i.e., gold, silver, platinum) in both North America and emerging markets.
Trading VaR at December 31, 2020 was higher as compared with December 31, 2019 due to an increase in volatility of foreign exchange and commodity prices, interest rates and credit spreads driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following graph summarizes daily VaR for our trading portfolios at a 99 percent confidence level (in millions):
The following table summarizes our trading VaR for 2020 and 2019:
(1)Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types, for example, foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread, together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures.
(2)The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects. For presentation purposes, portfolio diversification of the VaR for trading portfolios includes VaR-based risk-not-in-VaR.
HSBC USA Inc.
Back-testing We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-testing them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes non-modeled items such as fees, commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions from the actual reported profit and loss. We would expect, under stable market conditions, to see two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99 percent confidence level over a one-year period. However, in periods of unstable market conditions, we could see an increase in the number of back-testing exceptions.
In 2020, we experienced eight loss back-testing exceptions. One loss exception in January was mainly driven by palladium volatility. Five loss exceptions in March and two loss exceptions in April were primarily due to intensified market volatility as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the high number of loss exceptions, performance of the VaR model was in line with expectations when considered in the context of the extraordinary market movements observed in March 2020. During the period, market risk continued to be managed using a complementary set of exposure measures and limits, including stress and scenario analysis.
Non-trading portfolios Non-trading VaR predominantly relates to Markets Treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value (which includes available-for-sale and held-to-maturity assets) and associated hedges. Our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities. Our non-trading VaR exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility.
Non-trading VaR was higher at December 31, 2020 as compared with December 31, 2019 due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and U.S. Government agency credit spreads driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table summarizes our non-trading VaR for 2020 and 2019:
(1) Refer to the Trading VaR table above for additional information.
Non-trading VaR also includes the interest rate risk of non-trading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into Markets Treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it. Interest rate swaps used by Markets Treasury to hedge the interest rate risk of the investment portfolio and transfer price risk from the banking book are typically classified as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and included within our non-traded VaR. In case there is residual market risk that cannot be efficiently and conveniently hedged by Markets Treasury they are managed by ALCO in segregated ALCO books. See "Treasury Risk Management" above for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed.
Stressed VaR The following table reflects stressed VaR at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Stressed VaR at December 31, 2020 was lower as compared with December 31, 2019 driven by a reduction of inventory in rates and foreign exchange products as well as the impact of lower market rates during the stressed period.
Resilience Risk Management Resilience risk arises from failures or inadequacies in processes, people, systems or external events. Sustained and significant operational disruptions are events that could affect the stability of the wider financial system,
HSBC USA Inc.
the viability of the bank and our industry peers, the ability of our customers to access critical services or the underlying trust of our customers and regulators as a result of a poorly managed operational event.
In-line with the increasing expectations from customers, regulators and our Board of Directors, and in response to a continually evolving threat landscape that the wider industry faces, we formed a new Operational & Resilience Risk combined sub-function. This sub-function provides robust risk steward oversight of our businesses, functions, and critical business services, supported by effective and timely independent challenge. In addition, in 2020 we have:
•implemented business and function aligned teams focused on emerging risks as well as material products and services;
•strengthened the effectiveness and outcomes of independent oversight of all non-financial risk stewards;
•implemented central services including governance, reporting and transformation; and
•created a standalone assurance capability providing independent review and evaluation of end-to-end processes, risks and key controls.
We continue to prioritize our efforts on material risks and areas undergoing strategic growth. We deploy risk management oversight to the most material change programs across the organization and we ensure we have specialist risk teams in-place to provide expert oversight and guidance for highly technical areas of risk management.
The Operational & Resilience Risk sub-function provides guidance and stewardship to our businesses and functions about how we can prevent, adapt, and learn from resilience-related threats when something goes wrong. The Operational & Resilience Risk target operating model provides a consistent view across resilience risks, strengthening our risk management oversight while operating effectively as part of a simplified non-financial risk structure. We view resilience risk across seven risk types related to: third parties / supply-chain; information, technology and cyber security; payments and manual processing; physical security; business interruption / contingency risk; buildings unavailability; and workplace safety.
The Operational & Resilience Risk structure simplifies interactions with our key stakeholders by providing specialist skill and a single channel of contact, and actively challenges the business and delivers clear, consistent and credible responses, ensuring controls are being operated and risks are being managed.
A principal senior management meeting for Operational & Resilience Risk governance is the Group Non-Financial Risk Management Board, chaired by the Group Chief Risk Officer, with an escalation path to the Group Risk Management Meeting.
Operational Resilience is our ability to anticipate, prevent, adapt, respond to, recover and learn from internal or external disruption, protecting customers, the markets we operate in and their economic stability. Resilience is measured by assessing whether we are able to continue to provide our most important services, within an agreed tolerance, during a severe but plausible event. We accept that we will not be able to prevent all disruption, but we prioritize investment to continuously improve our response and recovery capability for our most important business services.
Systems and cyber resilience The security of our information and technology infrastructure is crucial for maintaining our applications and processes while protecting our customers and the HSBC brand. In common with other financial institutions and multinational organizations, we face a growing threat of cyberattacks that continue to increase in sophistication. A failure of our defenses against such attacks could result in financial loss or the loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine both our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our customers. We experienced cyberattacks in 2020, none of which resulted in material financial loss. We continue to mature our cyber intelligence capabilities as the cyber threat landscape evolves. These intelligence monitoring capabilities increase our agility and ability to respond with increased detection and response capabilities reducing potential exposure to cyber threats. Regulators have listed cybersecurity as their top concern in 2020. Regulation continues to increase from multiple jurisdictions and perspectives, and is deployed without coordination with other regulators. HSBC is engaged with peer institutions working to address regulatory harmonization as it relates to cyber and information security. We have met with the U.S. Treasury Department and all regulatory bodies (e.g. the OCC, FRB, FDIC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, etc.) to progress harmonization. Cybersecurity will continue to be a strong focus of ongoing initiatives to strengthen the control environment and our readiness to respond in the event of an attack.
Regulatory Compliance Risk Management Regulatory compliance risk arises from the risks associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counter-parties, inappropriate market conduct, and breaching other regulatory requirements. Regulatory compliance risk is measured by reference to identified metrics, key risk indicators, testing of controls by the three lines of defense, employee feedback, customer complaints and through regulatory feedback. Regulatory compliance risks are assessed through detailed assessments and reported to the RMM and the Board of Directors through the reporting of RAS metrics and the Regulatory Compliance Enterprise Risk Assessment report. Regulatory compliance risk is managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies and procedures, training employees in regulatory requirements, establishing controls, and monitoring and testing controls to help ensure that the regulatory requirements are being adhered to. Proactive assessment and enhancement of controls is undertaken where required.
HSBC USA Inc.
The Second LoD risk stewards provide independent, objective oversight and challenge and promote a compliance-orientated culture, supporting the businesses in delivering fair outcomes for customers, maintaining the integrity of financial markets and achieving our strategic objectives. Any actual or potential regulatory breaches require prompt identification and escalation to the Regulatory Compliance function or other applicable risk stewards. Any major breaches, gaps, issues and emerging risks are escalated to RMM and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.
The Compliance function oversees the management of regulatory compliance risk for laws, codes, rules, regulations and standards that align under its scope of oversight as the Second LoD risk steward. As a Board of Directors committee, the CCC oversees our compliance risk management program (both Regulatory Compliance and Financial Crime Risk) as well as fiduciary matters as discussed further below.
Fiduciary risk is a component of regulatory compliance risk and represents the risk of breaching fiduciary duties where we act in a fiduciary capacity as trustee, investment manager or as mandated by law or regulation. It is the risk associated with failing to offer services honestly and properly to clients in that capacity. Fiduciary risks reside in our WPB businesses (such as Investment Management, Personal Trust, Security Operation Services) and other business lines outside of WPB (such as Corporate Trust). Fiduciary risk is governed by the CCC. The CCC has delegated day-to-day management and oversight responsibilities to management, whose primary oversight body for management of fiduciary activity is the Fiduciary Risk Management Meeting, chaired by the U.S. Head of Enterprise Compliance. The U.S. Head of Enterprise Compliance reports to the U.S. Chief Compliance Officer.
Financial Crime Risk Management Financial crime risk management is the framework in place to identify and deter potential illegal activity from occurring by, at, or through the HSBC Group. It is embedded in our day-to-day operations and culture.
The Financial Crime function ("FC") is led by the U.S. Head of Financial Crime, who reports to the U.S. Chief Compliance Officer. FC provides oversight to enable us to build on our achievements in managing financial crime risk effectively and to continue to strengthen financial crime detection, and anti-money laundering, sanctions, fraud, tax evasion and anti-bribery and corruption compliance. The U.S. Head of Financial Crime has delegated authority from the CEO over the FCRMC which escalates to the CCC on matters relating to financial crime and fraud risk management. Line of Business Financial Crime Risk Management Committees ("LoB FCRMCs") are established to support the effective management of financial crime risk at the lines of business. The LoB FCRMCs are chaired by the respective line of business CEOs, and may be combined with the LoB risk management and oversight meetings. We use a Financial Crime Risk Management Information Dashboard to monitor risk and performance indicators of financial crime, including trends and potential gaps in the management of financial crime risk that require attention.
Compliance continues to proactively identify, analyze and investigate financial crime risk and ensure proper mitigation of these risks. It embeds policies and procedures, introduces new technology solutions, and supports a culture of compliance needed to effectively manage financial crime risk, including the enterprise wide compliance risk management program.
Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and challenges through the strategic planning process. This risk is also a function of the compatibility of our strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation.
We have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital. All changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line, functional, regional, board and HSBC levels. This process is monitored by the Strategy and Planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards.
Reputational risk is a component of strategic risk and represents the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event, behavior, action or inaction, either by us, our employees, the HSBC Group or those with whom it is associated, that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us. This might also result in financial or non-financial impacts, loss of confidence or other consequences. The safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff. Reputational risk can arise from social, ethical or environmental issues, or as a consequence of operational and other risk events. Our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business, but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves.
Reputational risk relates to stakeholders' perceptions, whether based on fact or otherwise. Stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus, reputational risk is dynamic and will differ between geographies, groups and individuals.
We tolerate a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management, carefully considered and/or mitigated and is determined to fall to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by the HSBC Group risk appetite statement. Since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities, all businesses and functions are required to articulate and track reputational risk.
HSBC USA Inc.
Reputational risk is considered and assessed by the HSBC Group Management Board, the HSBC Group and local Board of Directors and senior management during the establishment of standards for all major aspects of business and the formulation of policy and products. These policies, which are an integral part of the internal control systems, are communicated through manuals and statements of policy, internal communication and training. The policies form the basis for operational procedures, as well as consideration of reputational risk in areas including money laundering deterrence, economic sanctions, environmental impact, anti-corruption measures, employee relations, inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements.
We have taken steps over the past several years to de-risk our businesses and product offering to reduce reputational risk. In addition, we continue to strengthen our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken.
The RMM and FCRMC provide governance and oversight of reputational risk. Each business reviews transactions and customers that may adversely affect our public perception via their RRCSC. The RRCSCs are chaired by a senior executive and comprise senior members from the business, risk, legal, financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties. The RRCSCs are responsible for reviewing the individual merits and involved parties in higher-risk transactions, and approving or declining customer relationships and transactions based on the potential risks to us. In addition to the RRCSCs, the responsibility of the practical implementation of such policies and the compliance with the letter and spirit of them rests with our CEO and senior management of our businesses.
Model Risk Management In order to manage the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions (e.g. customer conduct, financial crime, pricing, profit & loss and balance sheet and capital reporting, etc.) arising from models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used; or that models do not perform in line with expectations and predictions, a comprehensive model risk management framework has been established that provides oversight and challenge to all models across HSBC North America. The framework includes a Model Standards Policy that aligns with model risk management regulations. A model inventory is maintained and updated on a semi-annual basis. In addition, a model risk measurement framework is used to measure, mitigate and monitor model risk. Model risk is managed on an ongoing basis as part of a Model Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CRO with representation from businesses and functions. The Independent Model Review ("IMR") team, which is part of the Model Risk Management function, is responsible for providing effective challenge to models and critical processes implemented for use within HSBC North America. Validations are conducted in-line with supervisory guidance on model risk management issued by the OCC and FRB as well as other applicable internal guidelines. IMR activities are segregated from the model development process to ensure that incentives are aligned with the function's role to challenge models and identify model limitations. The IMR process assesses model development, implementation, use, validation, and governance. In 2020, we developed new model risk controls that now form the basis for model risk control and assessments which have been implemented for our businesses and functions.
