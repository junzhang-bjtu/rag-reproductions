Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedules of investments, of Hercules Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
We have also previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedules of investments, of Hercules Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 through 2017 (none of which are presented herein), and we expressed unqualified opinions on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the Senior Securities table of Hercules Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, appearing on page 172, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 by correspondence with the custodians, agent banks and portfolio company investees; when replies were not received, we performed other auditing procedures. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of Investments - Level 3 Investments in Senior Secured Debt, Unsecured Debt, Preferred Stock, Common Stock and Warrants
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 89.9% of the Company’s $2,450 million total investments in securities as of December 31, 2020 represents investments in level 3 senior secured debt, unsecured debt, preferred stock, common stock and warrants whose fair value, as disclosed by management, is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Management applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of these level 3 investments, which involved the use of significant unobservable inputs related to i) hypothetical market yields and premiums/(discounts) for debt securities; ii) the probability weighting of alternative outcomes for impaired debt securities; and iii) the revenue and/or EBITDA multiples, market equity adjustments, discounts for lack of marketability, tangible book value multiple, and estimated time to exit for warrant and equity-related securities.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of level 3 investments in senior secured debt, unsecured debt, preferred stock, common stock and warrants is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management to determine the fair value of these level 3 investments, including the use of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained relating to the significant unobservable inputs. The audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of level 3 investments in senior secured debt, unsecured debt, preferred stock, common stock and warrants, including controls over the Company’s methods and significant unobservable inputs. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methods, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant unobservable inputs used in those methods related to the hypothetical market yields and premiums/(discounts) for debt securities; the probability weighting of alternative outcomes for impaired debt securities; and the revenue and/or EBITDA multiples, market equity adjustments, discounts for lack of marketability, tangible book value multiple (equity-related security only), and estimated time to exit for warrant and equity-related securities, and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent fair value range for a sample of securities and comparison of management’s estimate to each of the independently developed fair value range. Developing the independent fair
value range involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and developing independent significant unobservable inputs in order to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s fair value estimate of these certain level 3 investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of Business
Hercules Capital, Inc. (the “Company”) is a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to high-growth, innovative venture capital-backed companies in a variety of technology, life sciences, and sustainable and renewable technology industries. The Company sources its investments through its principal office located in Palo Alto, CA, as well as through its additional offices in Boston, MA, New York, NY, Bethesda, MD, Hartford, CT, Westport, CT, Chicago, IL, and San Diego, CA. The Company was incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland in December 2003.
The Company is an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a Business Development Company (“BDC”) under the 1940 Act. From incorporation through December 31, 2005, the Company was subject to tax as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Code. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code (see “Note 6 - Income Taxes”).
The Company does not currently use Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, derivatives however to the extent that it uses CFTC derivatives in the future, it intends to do so below prescribed levels and will not market itself as a “commodity pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments. The Company has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA, pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA. The Company is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA.
Hercules Technology III, L.P. (“HT III”) and Hercules Capital IV, L.P. (“HC IV”) are Delaware limited partnerships that were formed in September 2009 and December 2010, respectively. HT III, and HC IV were licensed to operate as small business investment companies (“SBICs”) under the authority of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) on May 26, 2010, and October 27, 2020, respectively. Hercules Technology II, L.P. (“HT II”) was a Delaware limited partnership formed in January 2005 to operate as an SBIC. On July 13, 2018, the Company completed repayment of the remaining outstanding HT II debentures and subsequently surrendered the SBA license with respect to HT II.
As SBICs, HT III and HC IV are subject to a variety of regulations concerning, among other things, the size and nature of the companies in which it may invest and the structure of those investments. As of December 31, 2020, and since receiving the license to operate as an SBIC on October 27, 2020, HC IV has not drawn any debentures and has no material assets other than cash from regulatory capital provided.
The Company also formed Hercules Technology SBIC Management, LLC (“HTM”), a limited liability company, in November 2003. HTM is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and serves as the limited partner and general partner of HT II, HT III and HC IV (see “Note 5 - Borrowings”).
The Company also established wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are structured as Delaware corporations or limited liability companies, to hold portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities). These subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with Hercules for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S GAAP and pursuant to Regulation S-X. The Company’s functional currency is U.S. dollars (“USD”) and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency.
As an investment company, the Company follows accounting and reporting guidance as set forth in Topic 946 (“Financial Services - Investment Companies”) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, as amended (“ASC”). As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a portfolio company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Rather, an investment company’s interest in portfolio companies that are not investment companies should be measured at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 946.
Financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income, expenses, gains and losses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic and regulatory environment, financial markets, the credit worthiness of our portfolio companies, the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) during the first quarter of 2020, and any other parameters used in determining these estimates and assumptions could cause actual results to differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and all VIEs of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
A VIE is an entity that either (i) has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or (ii) has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party with both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, the Company considers all the facts and circumstances including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the party that makes the most significant decisions affecting the VIE is determined to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity interests, servicing rights and fee arrangements, and any other variable interests in the VIE. If the Company determines that it is the party with the power to make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE, and the Company has a potentially significant interest in the VIE, then it consolidates the VIE.
The Company performs periodic reassessments, usually quarterly, of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether the Company has acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The Company also reconsiders whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore are subject to the VIE consolidation framework.
As of December 31, 2020, the VIEs consolidated by the Company are its securitization VIEs formed in conjunction with the issuance of the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes and the 2028 Asset-Backed Notes (as defined herein). See “Note 5 - Borrowings”.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company follows guidance in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC Topic 820”), where fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and outlines a three-tier hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable market data input and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to establish a classification of fair value measurements. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value using a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs for the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the information available. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets or liabilities may not be an indication of the risks associated with investing in those assets or liabilities. ASC Topic 820 also requires disclosure for fair value measurements based on the level within the hierarchy of the information used in the valuation. ASC Topic 820 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
The Company categorizes all investments recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC Topic 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:
Level 1-Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the measurement date. The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are equities listed in active markets.
Level 2-Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset in connection with market data at the measurement date and for the extent of the instrument’s anticipated life. Fair valued assets that are generally included in this category are publicly held debt investments and warrants held in a public company.
Level 3-Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset at the measurement date. It includes prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Generally, assets carried at fair value and included in this category are the debt investments and warrants and equities held in a private company.
Valuation of Investments
The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 89.7% of the Company’s total assets represented investments in portfolio companies whose fair value is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Value, as defined in Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, is (i) the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and (ii) for all other securities and assets, fair value is as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. The Company’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the 1940 Act and ASC Topic 946 and measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820. The Company’s debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company’s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. As such, the Company values substantially all of its investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to a consistent valuation policy by the Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 820 and the 1940 Act. Due to the inherent uncertainty in determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company’s investments determined in good faith by its Board of Directors may differ significantly from the value that would have been used had a readily available market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.
The Company intends to continue to engage one or more independent valuation firm(s) to provide management with assistance regarding the Company’s determination of the fair value of selected portfolio investments each quarter unless directed by the Board of Directors to cancel such valuation services. Specifically, on a quarterly basis, the Company will identify portfolio investments with respect to which an independent valuation firm will assist in valuing. The Company selects these portfolio investments based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the potential for material fluctuations in valuation results, size, credit quality and the time lapse since the last valuation of the portfolio investment by an independent valuation firm. The scope of services rendered by the independent valuation firm is at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors are ultimately, and solely, responsible for determining the fair value of the Company’s investments in good faith. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. The Company determines the fair value of each individual investment and records changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, the Board of Directors have approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
(1) the Company’s quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment;
(2) preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and business-based assumptions are discussed with the Company’s investment committee;
(3) the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuation of the investments in the portfolio as provided by the investment committee which incorporates the results of the independent valuation firm as appropriate; and
(4) the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the Company’s portfolio in good faith based on the input of, where applicable, the respective independent valuation firm and the investment committee.
Debt Investments
The Company follows the guidance set forth in ASC Topic 820 which establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and outlines a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. The Company’s debt securities are primarily invested in venture capital-backed companies in technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology at all stages of development. Given the nature of lending to these types of businesses, substantially all of the Company’s investments in these portfolio companies are considered Level 3 assets under ASC Topic 820 because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for debt instruments for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, invest in public debt of companies that meet the Company’s investment objectives. These investments are considered Level 2 assets.
In making a good faith determination of the value of the Company’s investments, the Company generally starts with the cost basis of the investment, which includes the value attributed to the original issue discount (“OID”), if any, and payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or other receivables which have been accrued as earned. The Company then applies the valuation methods as set forth below.
The Company applies a procedure for debt investments that assumes the sale of each investment in a hypothetical market to a hypothetical market participant where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The hypothetical market does not include scenarios where the underlying security was simply repaid or extinguished, but includes an exit concept. The Company determines the yield at inception for each debt investment. The Company then uses senior secured, leveraged loan yields provided by third party providers to determine the change in market yields between inception of the debt investment and the measurement date. Industry specific indices and other relevant market data are used to benchmark and assess market-based movements.
Under this process, the Company also evaluates the collateral for recoverability of the debt investments. The Company considers each portfolio company’s credit rating, security liens and other characteristics of the investment to adjust the baseline yield to derive a credit adjusted hypothetical yield for each investment as of the measurement date. The anticipated future cash flows from each investment are then discounted at the hypothetical yield to estimate each investment’s fair value as of the measurement date.
The Company’s process includes an analysis of, among other things, the underlying investment performance, the current portfolio company’s financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation, estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. The Company values its syndicated debt investments using broker quotes and bond indices amongst other factors. If there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a debt investment, the Company may consider other factors to estimate fair value, including the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis.
The Company records unrealized depreciation on investments when it believes that an investment has decreased in value, including where collection of a debt investment is doubtful or, if under the in-exchange premise, when the value of a debt investment is less than amortized cost of the investment. Conversely, where appropriate, the Company records unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, that its investment has also appreciated in value or, if under the in-exchange premise, the value of a debt investment is greater than amortized cost.
When originating a debt instrument, the Company generally receives warrants or other equity-related securities from the borrower. The Company determines the cost basis of the warrants or other equity-related securities received based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and warrants or other equity-related securities received. Any resulting discount on the debt investments from recordation of the warrant or other equity instruments is accreted into interest income over the life of the debt investment.
Debt investments that are traded on a public exchange are valued at the prevailing market price as of the valuation date.
Equity-Related Securities and Warrants
Securities that are traded in the over-the-counter markets or on a stock exchange will be valued at the prevailing bid price at period end. The Company has a limited amount of equity securities in public companies. In accordance with the 1940 Act, unrestricted publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the measurement date.
The Company estimates the fair value of warrants using a Black Scholes OPM. At each reporting date, privately held warrant and equity-related securities are valued based on an analysis of various factors including, but not limited to, the portfolio company’s operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions, price to enterprise value or price to equity ratios, discounted cash flow, valuation comparisons to comparable public companies or other industry benchmarks. When an external event occurs, such as a purchase transaction, public offering, or subsequent equity sale, the pricing indicated by that external event is utilized to corroborate the Company’s valuation of the warrant and equity-related securities. The Company periodically reviews the valuation of its portfolio companies that have not been involved in a qualifying external event to determine if the enterprise value of the portfolio company may have increased or decreased since the last valuation measurement date.
Investment Funds & Vehicles
The Company applies the practical expedient provided by the ASC Topic 820 relating to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value (“NAV”) per share (or its equivalent). ASC Topic 820 permits an entity holding investments in certain entities that either are investment companies, or have attributes similar to an investment company, and calculate NAV per share or its equivalent for which the fair value is not readily determinable, to measure the fair value of such investments on the basis of that NAV per share, or its equivalent, without adjustment. Investments which are valued using NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy as per ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (Or its Equivalent)”.
Cash, Restricted Cash, and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist solely of funds deposited with financial institutions and short-term liquid investments in money market deposit accounts. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted cash and cash equivalents include amounts that are collected and are held by trustees who have been appointed as custodians of the assets securing certain of the Company’s financing transactions.
Other Assets
Other assets generally consist of prepaid expenses, deferred financing costs net of accumulated amortization, fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation, deferred revenues and deposits and other assets, including escrow receivable.
Escrow Receivables
Escrow receivables are collected in accordance with the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement. Escrow balances are typically distributed over a period greater than one year and may accrue interest during the escrow period. Escrow balances are measured for collectability on at least a quarterly basis and fair value is determined based on the amount of the estimated recoverable balances and the contractual maturity date. As of December 31, 2020, there were no material past due escrow receivables. The escrow receivable balance as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was approximately $64,000 and $955,000, respectively, and was fair valued and held in accordance with ASC Topic 820.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and operating lease liability obligations in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The Company recognizes a ROU asset and an operating lease liability for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases which have a term of 12 months or less. ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liability obligations represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and has separated these components when determining the ROU assets and the related lease liabilities. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and lease direct costs. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See “Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies”.
Income Recognition
The Company records interest income on an accrual basis and recognizes it as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. OID initially represents the value of detachable equity warrants obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of debt securities and is accreted into interest income over the term of the loan as a yield enhancement. Debt investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or fees will not be collected according to contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, the Company ceases to recognize interest and fee income until the portfolio company has paid all principal and interest due or demonstrated the ability to repay its current and future contractual obligations to the Company. The Company may not apply the non-accrual status to a loan where the investment has sufficient collateral value to collect all of the contractual amount due and is in the process of collection. Interest collected on non-accrual investments are generally applied to principal.
Fee income, generally collected in advance, includes loan commitment and facility fees for due diligence and structuring, as well as fees for transaction services and management services rendered by the Company to portfolio companies and other third parties. Loan commitment and facility fees are amortized into income over the contractual life of the loan. Management fees are generally recognized as income when the services are rendered. Loan origination fees are capitalized and then amortized into interest income using the effective interest rate method. In certain loan arrangements, warrants or other equity interests are received from the borrower as additional origination fees. The Company had approximately $39.2 million of unamortized fees at December 31, 2020, of which approximately $32.2 million was included as an offset to the cost basis of its current debt investments and approximately $7.0 million was deferred contingent upon the occurrence of a funding or milestone. At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $42.0 million of unamortized fees, of which approximately $34.6 million was included as an offset to the cost basis of the Company’s current debt investments and approximately $7.4 million was deferred contingent upon the occurrence of a funding or milestone.
The Company recognizes nonrecurring fees amortized over the remaining term of the loan commencing in the quarter relating to specific loan modifications. Certain fees may still be recognized as one-time fee income, including prepayment penalties, fees related to select covenant default waiver fees and acceleration of previously deferred loan fees and OID related to early loan pay-off or material modification of the specific debt outstanding. The Company recorded approximately $8.3 million and $6.0 million in one-time fee income during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
In addition, the Company may also be entitled to an exit fee that is amortized into income over the life of the loan. Loan exit fees to be paid at the termination of the loan are accreted into interest income over the contractual life of the loan. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $40.9 million in exit fees receivable, of which approximately $37.6 million was included as a component of the cost basis of its current debt investments and approximately $3.3 million was a deferred receivable related to expired commitments. At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $33.5 million in exit fees receivable, of which approximately $31.9 million was included as a component of the cost basis of its current debt investments and approximately $1.6 million was a deferred receivable related to expired commitments.
The Company has debt investments in its portfolio that contain a PIK provision. Contractual PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company will generally cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or management does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. The Company recorded approximately $9.0 million and $8.7 million in PIK income in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
To maintain the Company’s ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, PIK and exit fee income generally must be accrued and distributed to stockholders in the form of dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though the cash has not yet been collected. Amounts necessary to pay these distributions may come from available cash or the liquidation of certain investments.
In certain investment transactions, the Company may provide advisory services. For services that are separately identifiable and external evidence exists to substantiate fair value, income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment transaction closes. The Company had no income from advisory services in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Equity Offering Expenses
The Company’s offering costs are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when received as a reduction of capital upon completion of an offering of registered securities.
Borrowings
The borrowings of the Company are carried at amortized cost which comprise of the principal amount borrowed net of any unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. Discounts and issuance costs are accreted to interest expense and loan fees, respectively, using the straight-line method, which closely approximates the effective yield method, over the remaining life of the underlying debt obligations (see “Note 6 - Borrowings”). Accrued but unpaid interest is included within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs and other direct incremental costs incurred by the Company in obtaining debt financing are amortized over the life of the related debt instrument using the straight-line method, which closely approximates the effective yield method. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 835-30 (“Interest - Imputation of Interest”), debt issuance costs are presented as a reduction to the associated liability balance on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, except for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements which are included within Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company has issued and may, from time to time, issue stock options and restricted stock to employees under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and the Director Plan. Management follows the guidelines set forth under ASC Topic 718, to account for stock options and restricted stock granted. Under ASC Topic 718, compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rate and expected option life.
Income Taxes
The Company intends to operate so as to qualify to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and, as such, will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of taxable income (including gains) distributed as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Taxable income includes the Company’s taxable interest, dividend and fee income, reduced by certain deductions, as well as taxable net realized securities gains. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial
reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as such gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.
As a RIC, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company makes distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a timely manner to its stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. The Company will not be subject to this excise tax on any amount on which the Company incurred U.S. federal corporate income tax (such as the tax imposed on a RIC’s retained net capital gains).
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, the Company may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current taxable year distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes from such taxable income into the next taxable year and incur a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution in the next taxable year under the Code is the total amount of distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent the Company chooses to carry over taxable income into the next taxable year, distributions declared and paid by the Company in a taxable year may differ from the Company’s taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year taxable income, the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year, or returns of capital.
The Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that it may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and, depending upon the level of taxable income earned in a year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable U.S. federal excise tax.
Because federal income tax regulations differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and net realized securities gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Permanent differences may also result from the change in the classification of certain items, such as the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Also, recent tax legislation requires that income be recognized for tax purposes no later than when recognized for financial reporting purposes.
Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding includes common stock and restricted stock for which no future service is required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable pursuant to stock options and to restricted stock for which future service is required as a condition to the delivery of the underlying common stock.
In accordance with ASC 260-10-45-60A, the Company uses the two-class method in the computation of basic EPS and diluted EPS, if applicable.
Comprehensive Income
The Company reports all changes in comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company did not have other comprehensive income in 2020, 2019, or 2018. The Company’s comprehensive income is equal to its net increase in net assets resulting from operations.
Distributions
Distributions to common stockholders are approved by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and the distribution payable is recorded on the ex-dividend date.
The Company maintains an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of the Company’s distribution on behalf of the Company’s stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company declares a distribution, cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of its common stock unless the stockholder specifically “opts out” of the dividend reinvestment plan and chooses to receive cash distributions. During 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company issued 280,690, 180,135, and 159,560 shares, respectively, of common stock to shareholders in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan.
Segments
The Company lends to and invests in portfolio companies in various technology-related industries including technology, drug discovery and development, biotechnology, life sciences, healthcare, and sustainable and renewable technology. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its lending and investment relationships. However, because each of these loan and investment relationships has similar business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single reportable segment.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”, which is intended to improve the effectiveness of fair value measurement disclosures. The amendment, among other things, affects certain disclosure requirements related to transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and level 3 fair value measurements as they relate to valuation process, unrealized gains and losses, measurement uncertainty, and significant unobservable inputs. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company partially adopted the standard effective July 1, 2019 and fully adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020, which did not have a material impact, on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the periods presented.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to certain contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. The Company has agreements that have LIBOR as a reference rate with certain portfolio companies and also with certain lenders. These agreements include language for choosing an alternative successor rate if LIBOR reference is no longer considered to be appropriate. The change from LIBOR to a successor rate will result in an amendment to such agreements. The Company has adopted this amendment as of March 12, 2020 and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures for the periods presented.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-6, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)”, which is intended to address issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The amendment, among other things, reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock and enhances information transparency by making targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company does not intend to early adopt the standard and is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40).” This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing certain implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance provides flexibility in adoption, allowing for either retrospective adjustment or prospective adjustment for all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
SEC Disclosures Update and Simplification
In May 2020, the SEC revised its measure of “significant subsidiary” set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) for investment companies. The new definition includes an alternative income measure to determine a “significant subsidiary”. The final rule will be effective on January 1, 2021, but voluntary compliance is permitted in advance of the effective date. The Company has elected to implement this
new rule effective June 30, 2020 which is expected to require the Company to provide separate audited financial statements and summarized financial information for fewer of its controlled portfolio companies going forward.
In August 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release Nos. 33-10825 and 34-89670 (collectively, the “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105”). These rules amend certain SEC disclosure requirements to improve disclosures for investors, and to simplify compliance obligations for registrants. The final rules are effective on November 9, 2020. The Company has adopted this guidance, which did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value estimates are made at discrete points in time based on relevant information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized in the tables below based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
(1)
This investment is included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
(2)
In accordance with US GAAP, certain investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy as per ASU 2015-07. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
The table below presents a reconciliation for all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
(1)
Included in net realized gains or losses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(2)
Included in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(3)
Transfers out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2020 relate to the initial public offerings of Palantir Technologies, Outset Medical, Doordash, Inc., 908 Devices, Inc. and Yumanity Therapeutics, Inc., the acquisition of Postmates, Inc. by Uber, Inc., and the conversion of Level 3 debt investments into Level 3 common stock investments. Transfers into Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the conversion of Level 3 debt investments into Level 3 common stock investments.
(4)
Transfers out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to the initial public offerings of Lightspeed POS, Inc., Lyft, Inc., Avedro, Inc., Stealth Bio Therapeutics Corp., X4 Pharmaceuticals, Inc., BridgeBio Pharma LLC, Pinterest, Inc., TransMedics Group, Inc., Fastly, Inc., Brickell Biotech, Inc., Oportun, and Tela Bio, Inc.. Transfers into Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to the delisting of Motif BioSciences Inc. common stock.
(5)
Amounts listed above are inclusive of loan origination fees received at the inception of the loan which are deferred and amortized into fee income as well as the accretion of existing loan discounts and fees during the period. Escrow receivable purchases may include additions due to proceeds held in escrow from the liquidation of level 3 investments.
(6)
Amounts listed above include the acceleration and payment of loan discounts and loan fees due to early payoffs or restructures along with regularly scheduled amortization.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $6.8 million and $9.6 million in net unrealized appreciation was recorded for preferred stock and common stock Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date. For the same period, approximately $6.7 million and $6.2 million in net unrealized appreciation was recorded for debt and warrant Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $11.6 million and $4.6 million in net unrealized appreciation was recorded for preferred stock and common stock Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date. For the same period, approximately $5.9 million and $1.5 million in net unrealized depreciation was recorded for debt and warrant Level 3 investments, respectively, relating to assets still held at the reporting date.
The following tables provide quantitative information about the Company’s Level 3 fair value measurements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, according to the Company’s valuation policy the Company may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining the Company’s fair value measurements. The tables below are not intended to be all-inclusive, but rather provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs as they relate to the Company’s fair value measurements. See the accompanying Consolidated Schedule of Investments for the fair value of the Company’s investments. The methodology for the determination of the fair value of the Company’s investments is discussed in “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s escrow receivables is the amount recoverable at the contractual maturity date of the escrow receivable.
(1)The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s debt securities are hypothetical market yields and premiums/(discounts). The hypothetical market yield is defined as the exit price of an investment in a hypothetical market to hypothetical market participants where buyers and sellers are willing participants. The premiums/(discounts) relate to company specific characteristics such as underlying investment performance, security liens, and other characteristics of the investment. Significant increases (decreases) in the inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement, depending on the materiality of the investment. Debt investments in the industries noted in the Company’s Consolidated Schedule of Investments are included in the industries noted above as follows:
•
Pharmaceuticals, above, is comprised of debt investments in the “Drug Discovery & Development” and “Healthcare Services, Other” industries in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.
•
Technology, above, is comprised of debt investments in the “Communications & Networking”, “Information Services”, “Internet Consumer & Business Services”, “Media/Content/Info” and “Software” industries in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments.
•

The Company believes that the carrying amounts of its financial instruments other than investments and borrowings, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables including escrow receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate the fair values of such items due to the short maturity of such instruments. The borrowings of the Company are recorded at amortized cost and not at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The fair value of the Company’s outstanding borrowings is based on observable market trading prices or quotations and unobservable market rates as applicable for each instrument.
Based on market quotations on or around December 31, 2020, the 2022 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes were quoted for 1.017, 1.001, 1.002, and 1.027 per dollar at par value, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the April 2025 Notes and 2033 Notes were trading on the NYSE for $25.50 and $26.80 per unit at par value, respectively. The par value at underwriting for the April 2025 Notes and 2033 Notes was $25.00 per unit. The fair values of the SBA debentures, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, and March 2026 A Notes are calculated based on the net present value of payments over the term of the notes using estimated market rates for similar notes and remaining terms. The fair values of the outstanding borrowings under the Union Bank Facility and the Wells Facility are equal to their outstanding principal balances. The
table below provides the approximate fair values and level in the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
4. Investments
Control and affiliate investments
As required by the 1940 Act, the Company classifies its investments by level of control. “Control investments” are defined in the 1940 Act as investments in those companies that the Company is deemed to “control”. Under the 1940 Act, the Company is generally deemed to “control” a company in which it has invested if it owns 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or has greater than 50% representation on its board. “Affiliate investments” are investments in those companies that are “affiliated companies” of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, which are not control investments. The Company is deemed to be an “affiliate” of a company in which it has invested if it owns 5% or more, but generally less than 25%, of the voting securities of such company. “Non-control/non-affiliate investments” are investments that are neither control investments nor affiliate investments.
The following table summarizes the Company’s realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on control and affiliate investments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Portfolio Composition
The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s portfolio of investments by asset class as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
A summary of the Company’s investment portfolio, at value, by geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is shown as follows:
The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s portfolio by industry sector at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
No single portfolio investment represents more than 10% of the fair value of the Company’s total investments as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
In accordance with Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-09” and “Rule 4-08(g),” respectively), the Company must determine if its unconsolidated subsidiaries are considered “significant subsidiaries.” As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no unconsolidated subsidiaries that are considered “significant subsidiaries”.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company’s customers are primarily privately held companies and public companies which are active in the “Software”, “Drug Discovery & Development”, “Internet Consumer & Business Services”, “Sustainable and Renewable Technology”, and “Information Services” sectors. These sectors are characterized by high margins, high growth rates, consolidation and product and market extension opportunities. Value for companies in these sectors is often vested in intangible assets and intellectual property.
Industry and sector concentrations vary as new loans are recorded and loans are paid off. Loan revenue, consisting of interest, fees, and recognition of gains on equity and warrant or other equity-related interests, can fluctuate materially when a loan is paid off or a related warrant or equity interest is sold. Revenue recognition in any given year can be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company’s ten largest portfolio companies represented approximately 27.9% and 27.8% of the total fair value of the Company’s investments in portfolio companies, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had three and six portfolio companies, respectively, that represented 5% or more of the Company’s net assets. At December 31, 2020, the Company had four equity investments representing approximately 63.7% of the total fair value of the Company’s equity investments, and each represented 5% or more of the total fair value of the Company’s equity investments. At December 31, 2019, the Company had six equity investments which represented approximately 63.3% of the total fair value of the Company’s equity investments, and each represented 5% or more of the total fair value of such investments.
Investment Collateral
In the majority of cases, the Company collateralizes its investments by obtaining a first priority security interest in a portfolio company’s assets, which may include its intellectual property. In other cases, the Company may obtain a negative pledge covering a company’s intellectual property. At December 31, 2020, approximately 84.2% of the Company’s debt investments at fair value were in a senior secured first lien position, with 43.5% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company, including its intellectual property, 31.0% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company and the portfolio company was prohibited from pledging or encumbering its intellectual property, 0.6% of the Company’s debt investments at fair value were senior secured by the equipment of the portfolio company, and 9.1% of the Company’s debt investments at fair value were in a first lien “last-out” senior secured position with security interest in all of the assets of the portfolio company, whereby the “last-out” loans will be subordinated to the “first-out” portion of the unitranche loan in a liquidation, sale or other disposition. Another 15.1% of the Company’s debt investments at fair value were secured by a second priority security interest in the portfolio company’s assets, and 0.7% were unsecured.
5. Borrowings

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. SBICs are subject to a variety of regulations and oversight by the SBA concerning the size and nature of the companies in which they may invest as well as the structures of those investments.
HT III is periodically examined and audited by the SBA’s staff to determine its compliance with SBA regulations. HT III was in compliance with the terms of the SBIC’s leverage as of December 31, 2020 as a result of having sufficient capital as defined under the SBA regulations.

2027 Asset-Backed Notes
On November 1, 2018, the Company completed a term debt securitization in connection with which an affiliate of the Company made an offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes.

As of October 21, 2020, the securitization is past its reinvestment period, and it may no longer reinvest principal collections into additional eligible loans. Accordingly, available funds from principal collections were used to pay $19.0 of the outstanding principal balance on the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes during the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest on the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes will be paid, to the extent of funds available, at a fixed rate of 4.605% per annum. The 2027 Asset-Backed Notes have a stated maturity of November 22, 2027.

2022 Convertible Notes
On January 25, 2017, the Company issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which amount includes the additional $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes issued pursuant to the initial purchaser’s exercise in full of its overallotment option. The 2022 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated January 25, 2017 (the “2022 Convertible Notes Indenture”), between the Company and the 2022 Trustee. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $225.5 million, including $4.5 million of debt issuance costs.
The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on February 1, 2022, unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2022 Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.375% per year payable semiannually in arrears on February 1, and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2017.
The 2022 Convertible Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that the Company later secures) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company’s subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2021, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture. On or after August 1, 2021 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, at its election, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock. The conversion rate is initially 60.9366 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $16.41 per share of common stock). The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if certain corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2020, the conversion rate was 60.9366 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes (equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of approximately $16.41 per share of common stock).
The Company may not redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes at its option prior to maturity. No sinking fund is provided for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events occur, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes may require the
Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their 2022 Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the required repurchase date.
The 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 470-20 (“Debt with Conversion and Other Options”). In accounting for the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Company estimated at the time of issuance that the values of the debt and the embedded conversion feature of the 2022 Convertible Notes were approximately 98.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The original issue discount of 1.5% or $3.4 million, attributable to the conversion feature of the 2022 Convertible Notes was recorded in “capital in excess of par value” in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As a result, the Company records interest expense comprised of both stated interest expense as well as accretion of the original issue discount resulting in an estimated effective interest rate of approximately 4.76%.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the components of the carrying value of the 2022 Convertible Notes were as follows:
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the components of interest expense, fees and cash paid for interest expense for the 2022 Convertible Notes were as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the indentures governing the 2022 Convertible Notes.
Credit Facilities

On January 11, 2019, Hercules Funding II entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Wells Facility (the “Wells Facility Seventh Amendment”). Among others, the Wells Facility Seventh Amendment amends certain key provisions of the Wells Facility to reduce the current interest rate to LIBOR plus 3.00% with an interest rate floor of 3.00%. The Wells Facility Seventh Amendment also extends the maturity date to January 2023, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. In addition, the Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC has committed $75.0 million in credit capacity with an accordion feature, in which the Company can increase the credit line up to an aggregate of $125.0 million, funded by additional lenders and with the agreement of Wells Fargo and subject to other customary conditions.

The Union Bank Facility replaced the Company’s credit facility (the “2019 Union Bank Facility”) entered into on February 20, 2019 with MUFG Union Bank, as the arranger and administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. The 2019 Union Bank Facility replaced the Company’s credit facility (the “Prior Union Bank Facility”) entered into on May 5, 2016 with MUFG Union Bank, as the arranger and administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. Any references to amounts related to the Union Bank Facility prior to February 20, 2020 were incurred and relate to the Prior Union Bank Facility or the 2019 Union Bank Facility, as applicable.
Under the Union Bank Facility, the lenders have made commitments of $400.0 million. The Union Bank Facility contains an accordion feature, in which the Company can increase the credit line up to an aggregate of $200.0 million, funded by existing or additional lenders and with the agreement of MUFG Union Bank and subject to other customary conditions.

6. Income Taxes
The Company intends to operate so as to qualify to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and, as such, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of taxable income (including gains) distributed as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Taxable income includes the Company’s taxable interest, dividend and fee income, reduced by certain deductions, as well as taxable net realized securities gains. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as such gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.
To qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, the Company is required to meet certain income and asset diversification tests in addition to distributing dividends of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, to its stockholders. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is based upon the annual earnings estimated by the management of the Company. To the extent that the Company’s earnings fall below the amount of dividend distributions declared, however, a portion of the total amount of the Company’s distributions for the fiscal year may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company’s stockholders.
Because federal income tax regulations differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. Permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their appropriate tax character. Permanent differences may also result from the change in the classification of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Also, recent tax legislation requires that income be recognized for tax purposes no later than when recognized for financial reporting purposes.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reclassified $67.7 million from accumulated realized gains (losses) to additional paid-in capital for book purposes primarily related to realized losses in four portfolio companies which are held in taxable subsidiaries and are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes. In addition, the Company reclassified $6.6 million from undistributed ordinary income to additional paid-in capital for book purposes during the year ended December 31, 2020 relating to accelerated revenue recognition for the tax years prior to December 31, 2017, which are closed tax years. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reclassified amounts from undistributed ordinary income or accumulated realized gains (losses) to additional paid-in capital for book purposes, as follows:
For income tax purposes, distributions paid to shareholders are reported as ordinary income, return of capital, long-term capital gains, or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions paid for the year ended December 31, 2020 was ordinary income in the amount of $118.0 million and long-term capital gains in the amount of $36.7 million. The tax character of distributions paid for the year ended December 31, 2019 was ordinary income in the amount of $122.2 million and long-term capital gains in the amount of $12.0 million.
The aggregate gross unrealized appreciation of the Company’s investments over cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes was $166.2 million and $70.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate gross unrealized depreciation of the Company’s investments under cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes was $126.1 million and $144.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net unrealized depreciation over cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes was $40.1 million and $73.8 million as December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate cost of securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes was $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis detailed below differ from the amounts reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities by temporary book or tax differences primarily arising from the treatment of loan related yield enhancements.
As a RIC, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company makes distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a timely manner to its stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. The Company will not be subject to this excise tax on any amount on which the Company incurred U.S. federal corporate income tax (such as the tax imposed on a RIC’s retained net capital gains).
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, the Company may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current taxable year distributions from such taxable income into the next taxable year and incur a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution in the next taxable year under the Code is the total amount of distributions paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent the Company chooses to carry over taxable income into the next taxable year, distributions declared and paid by the Company in a taxable year may differ from the Company’s taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year taxable income, the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year, or returns of capital.
The Company has taxable subsidiaries which hold certain portfolio investments in an effort to limit potential legal liability and/or comply with source-income type requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. These taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for U.S. GAAP and the portfolio investments held by the taxable subsidiaries are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and are recorded at fair value. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. Any income generated by these taxable subsidiaries generally would be subject to tax at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid approximately $2.5 million of income tax, including excise tax, and had $3.0 million accrued but unpaid tax expense as of December 31, 2020 . For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid approximately $1.4 million of income tax, including excise tax, and had $1.3 million accrued but unpaid tax expense as of the balance sheet date.
The Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is the Company’s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes.
Based on an analysis of the Company’s tax position, there are no uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria. The Company is currently not undergoing any tax examinations. The Company does not anticipate any significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the next twelve months. The 2017 - 2019 federal tax years for the Company remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The 2016 - 2019 state tax years for the Company remain subject to examination by the state taxing authorities.
7. Stockholders’ Equity

8. Equity Incentive Plans
The Company and its stockholders authorized and adopted the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”) for purposes of attracting and retaining the services of its executive officers and key employees. The Company and its stockholders authorized and adopted the 2006 Non-Employee Director Plan (the “2006 Plan”) for purposes of attracting and retaining the services of its Board of Directors. On June 21, 2017, the 2006 Plan expired in accordance with its terms and no additional awards may be granted under the 2006 Plan.
On May 13, 2018, the Board of Directors further amended and restated the 2004 Plan and renamed it the Hercules Capital, Inc.

The exemptive order also allows participants in the Director Plan and the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan to (i) elect to have the Company withhold shares of its common stock to pay for the exercise price and applicable taxes with respect to an option exercise (“net issuance exercise”) and/or (ii) permit the holders of restricted stock to elect to have the Company withhold shares of its stock to pay the applicable taxes due on restricted stock at the time of vesting. Each individual employee would be able to make a cash payment to satisfy applicable tax withholding at the time of option exercise or vesting on restricted stock.
The following table summarizes the common stock options activities for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
All options may be exercised for a period ending seven to ten years after the date of grant. At December 31, 2020, options for approximately 438,809 shares were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $13.18 per share with weighted average of remaining contractual term of 4.04 years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $661,000. At December 31, 2020, options for
approximately 305,606 shares were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $13.57 per share with weighted average of remaining contractual term of 3.13 years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $373,000.
The Company determined that the fair value of options granted under the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was approximately $10,000, $43,000 and $57,000, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, approximately $28,000, $41,000, and $54,000 of share-based cost due to stock option grants was expensed, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $24,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.59 years.
The Company follows ASC Topic 718 (“Compensation - Stock Compensation”) to account for stock options granted. Under ASC Topic 718, compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rate and expected option life. The fair value of options granted is based upon a Black Scholes OPM using the assumptions in the following table for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 and is as follows:
In 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company granted approximately 693,248, 136,081, and 334,995 shares, respectively, of restricted stock awards pursuant to the Plans. The Company determined that the fair values, based on grant date close price, of restricted stock awards granted under the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately $9.7 million, $1.7 million and $4.4 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $7.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.97 years.
The following table summarizes the activities for the Company’s unvested restricted stock awards for each of the three years ended, December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
In 2020, no shares of restricted stock units were granted by the Company pursuant to the Plans. In 2019 and 2018, the Company granted approximately, 1,029,836, and 411,689 shares, respectively, of restricted stock units pursuant to the Plans. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company also granted approximately 85,963, 147,842, and 103,774 shares, respectively, of distribution equivalent units pursuant to the Plans. The Company determined that the fair values, based on grant date close price, of restricted stock units granted under the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were approximately $1.2 million, $15.5 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $2.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.14 years.
The following table summarizes the activities for the Company’s unvested restricted stock units for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
(1)
With respect to restricted stock units granted prior to January 1, 2019, receipt of the shares of the Company’s common stock underlying vested restricted stock units will be deferred for four years from grant date unless certain conditions are met. Accordingly, such vested restricted stock units will not be issued as common stock upon vesting until the completion of the deferral period.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company expensed approximately $6.7 million, $8.8 million, and $8.2 million of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, respectively.
On May 2, 2018, the Company granted long-term Retention Performance Stock Unit awards (the “Retention PSUs”) under the 2004 Plan and separate cash bonus awards with similar terms (the “Cash Awards”) to senior personnel. The awards are designed to provide incentives that increase along with the total shareholder return (“TSR”). On May 2, 2018, the target number of Retention PSUs granted to senior personnel was 1,299,757 in the aggregate and the target amount of the Cash Awards granted to senior personnel was $4.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2020, there were 487,409 Retention PSUs outstanding at target and the target amount of the Cash Awards was $3.0 million in the aggregate. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no Retention PSUs at target were forfeited. The Retention PSUs and Cash Awards do not vest until the fourth anniversary “cliff vest” of the grant date (or a change in control of the Company, if earlier) and the Retention PSUs must generally be held and not disposed of until the fifth anniversary of the grant date, except in the event of death, disability or a change in control (the “Performance Period”). Distribution equivalent units will accrue in respect only of the Retention PSUs in the form of additional Retention PSUs, but will not be paid unless the Retention PSUs to which such distribution equivalent units relate actually vest. The Cash Awards are not eligible to accrue distribution equivalent units.
The Company follows ASC Topic 718 to account for the Retention PSUs and Cash Awards granted. Under ASC Topic 718, compensation cost associated with Retention PSUs is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the Performance Period. As the Cash Awards are settled in cash, the award is expensed as a liability, and will be re-measured at each reporting period until the Performance Period is complete. The compensation expense for these awards is based on the per unit grant date valuation using a Monte-Carlo simulation multiplied by the target payout level. The payout level is calculated based the Company’s TSR relative to specified BDCs during the Performance Period.
As of December 31, 2020, all outstanding Retention PSUs and Cash Awards were unvested and there was approximately $2.3 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the Retention PSUs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.33 years. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $4.0 million of accumulated compensation expense related to the Cash Awards. The accumulated expense related to the Cash Awards is included within the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
9. Earnings Per Share
Shares used in the computation of the Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:
In the table above, unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents are treated as participating securities for calculating earnings per share. Unvested common stock options and restricted stock units are also considered for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the effect of the 2022 Convertible Notes under the treasury stock method was anti-dilutive and, accordingly, was excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
The calculation of change in net assets resulting from operations per common share-assuming dilution, excludes all anti-dilutive shares. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the number of anti-dilutive shares, as calculated based on the weighted average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the periods, consisted of 5.5 million shares of 2022 Convertible Notes, 66,578 shares of unvested common stock options, no shares of unvested restricted stock units, 10,049 shares of unvested restricted stock awards, and no shares of unvested Retention PSUs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the number of anti-dilutive shares consisted of 3.4 million shares of 2022 Convertible Notes, 24,448 shares of unvested common stock options, no shares of unvested restricted stock units, and no shares of unvested Retention PSUs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the number of anti-dilutive shares consisted of 4.2 million shares of 2022 Convertible Notes, 62,462 shares of unvested common stock options, no shares of unvested restricted stock units, and 13,444 shares of unvested Retention PSUs.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was authorized to issue 200.0 million shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote.
10. Financial Highlights
Following is a schedule of financial highlights for the five years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016:
(1)
All per share activity is calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding for the relevant period, except net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions, which is based on the common shares outstanding as of the relevant balance sheet date.
(2)
Stock option expense is a non-cash expense that has no effect on net asset value. Pursuant to ASC Topic 718, net investment income includes the expense associated with the granting of stock options which is offset by a corresponding increase in paid-in capital.
(3)
The total return for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 equals to the change in the ending market value over the beginning of the period price per share plus distributions paid per share during the period, divided by the beginning price assuming the distribution is reinvested on the date of the distribution. As such, the total return is not annualized. The total return does not reflect any sales load that must be paid by investors.
(4)
The ratios are calculated based on weighted average net assets for the relevant period and are annualized.
(5)
The portfolio turnover rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 equals to the lesser of investment portfolio purchases or sales during the period, divided by the average investment portfolio value during the period. As such, portfolio turnover rate is not annualized.
(6)
Includes distributions on unvested restricted stock awards.
11. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company’s commitments and contingencies consist primarily of unused commitments to extend credit in the form of loans to the Company’s portfolio companies. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020 are dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, the Company’s credit agreements contain customary lending provisions which allow the Company relief from funding obligations for previously made unfunded commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the Company. Since a portion of these commitments may expire without being drawn, unfunded contractual commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As such, the Company’s disclosure of unfunded contractual commitments includes only those which are available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by future or unachieved milestones.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $179.8 million of unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which were available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by future or unachieved milestones.
The fair value of the Company’s unfunded commitments is considered to be immaterial as the yield determined at the time of underwriting is expected to be materially consistent with the yield upon funding, given that interest rates are generally pegged to market indices and given the existence of milestones, conditions and/or obligations imbedded in the borrowing agreements.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s unfunded contractual commitments available at the request of the portfolio company, including undrawn revolving facilities, and unencumbered by milestones are as follows:
(1)
For debt investments, amount represents unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which are available at the request of the portfolio company. Amount excludes unfunded commitments which are unavailable due to the borrower having not met certain milestones. For investment funds and vehicles, amount represents uncalled capital commitments in a private equity fund.
The following table provides additional information on the Company’s unfunded commitments regarding milestones, expirations and type:
The Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 include:
(1)
Excludes commitments to extend credit to the Company’s portfolio companies and uncalled capital commitments in a private equity fund.
(2)
Includes $99.0 million in principal outstanding under the SBA debentures, $150.0 million of the 2022 Notes, $105.0 million of the July 2024 Notes, $50.0 million of the February 2025 Notes, $75.0 million of the April 2025 Notes, $70.0 million of the June 2025 Notes, $50.0 million of the March 2026 A Notes, $40.0 million of the 2033 Notes, $181.0 million of the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, $250.0 million of the 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, and $230.0 million of the 2022 Convertible Notes. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Union Bank Facility and no outstanding borrowings under the Wells Facility as of December 31, 2020.
(3)
Amounts represent future principal repayments and not the carrying value of each liability. See “Note 5 - Borrowings”.
(4)
Facility leases and licenses including short-term leases.
Certain premises are leased or licensed under agreements which expire at various dates through June 2027. Total rent expense, including short-term leases, amounted to approximately $3.1 million, $2.7 million, and $2.1 million, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company recognizes an operating lease liability and a ROU asset for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease payments on short-term leases are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis. The discount rate applied to measure each ROU asset and lease liability is based on the Company’s weighted average cost of debt. The Company considers the general economic environment and its credit rating and factors in various financing and asset specific adjustments to ensure the discount rate applied is appropriate to the intended use of the underlying lease. While some of the leases contained options to extend and terminate, it is not reasonably certain that either option will be utilized and therefore, only the payments in the initial term of the leases were included in the lease liability and ROU asset.
The following table sets forth information related to the measurement of the Company’s operating lease liabilities and supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2020:
The following table shows future minimum lease payments under the Company’s operating leases and a reconciliation to the operating lease liability as of December 31, 2020:
The Company may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on the Company in connection with the activities of its portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect any current matters will materially affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.
12. Indemnification
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements are intended to provide its directors and executive officers the maximum indemnification permitted under Maryland law and the 1940 Act. Each indemnification agreement provides that the Company shall indemnify the director or executive officer who is a party to the agreement, or an “Indemnitee,” including the advancement of legal expenses, if, by reason of his or her corporate status, the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party to or a witness in any threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and the 1940 Act.
The Company and its executives and directors are covered by Directors and Officers Insurance, with the directors and officers being indemnified by the Company to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law subject to the restrictions in the 1940 Act.
