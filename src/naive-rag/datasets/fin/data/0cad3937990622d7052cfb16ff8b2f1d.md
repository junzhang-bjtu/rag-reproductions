ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Evergy, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Rate Matters and Regulation - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Kansas Corporation Commission and by the Missouri Public Service Commission (collectively the "Commissions"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Kansas and Missouri, respectively. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the
economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment, including asset retirements and abandonments; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operating and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.
The Company's rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.
When the Company retires a regulated plant, the Company must assess the probability of recovery of the regulated plant, which is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. Pending receipt of regulatory approval for the retirement and/or recovery of the affected plants, accounting for early retirements of regulated plants involves judgment related to the nature of the early retirement and the likelihood that the Company will recover its remaining investment in these retired generating plants with a return. Auditing the judgments related to the nature and likelihood of the retirement and the probability of recovering the generating plant investment with a return involves especially subjective and complex judgment.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) probability of potential charges related to the abandonment of regulated plants, and (3) a refund to customers. Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities.
•We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates, including Company management's determination of the likelihood of recovery of the full investment of certain regulated plants and probability of refunding amounts previously collected from customers related to certain regulated plants.
•We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.
•We evaluated external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas and Missouri, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available
information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.
•For regulatory matters in process, including those that could impact the early retirement of regulated plants, we inspected the Company's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company's future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.
•We evaluated the reasonableness of management's judgments for potential indicators of abandonment by performing the following:
◦We inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned.
◦We inspected the capital projects budget and construction-in-process listings and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life.
◦We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.
•We compared actual spend for projects that have been capitalized to property, plant, and equipment to budget. We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects. For significant projects that were over budget or if full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance. We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.
•We evaluated management's analysis, and letters from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.
•We evaluated management's conclusions for the probable recovery of the retired regulated plant investment with a return. We evaluated management's conclusions regarding the accounting for the abandonment of certain regulated plants and the impact of recent rate orders on the accounting.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
Evergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below.
•Evergy Kansas Central, Inc. (Evergy Kansas Central) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas. Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South, Inc. (Evergy Kansas South).
•Evergy Metro, Inc. (Evergy Metro) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.
•Evergy Missouri West, Inc. (Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.
•Evergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns 13.5% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP). Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects. Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.
Evergy Kansas Central also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP). Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.
Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy. Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 15,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.6 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri.
Evergy was incorporated in 2017 as Monarch Energy Holding, Inc. (Monarch Energy), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Incorporated (Great Plains Energy). Prior to the closing of the merger transactions described below, Monarch Energy changed its name to Evergy and did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 9, 2017, by and among Great Plains Energy, Evergy Kansas Central, Monarch Energy and King Energy, Inc. (King Energy), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Monarch Energy (Amended Merger Agreement). On June 4, 2018, in accordance with the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Evergy Kansas Central, with Evergy Kansas Central
surviving the merger. These merger transactions resulted in Evergy becoming the parent entity of Evergy Kansas Central and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the merger.
Principles of Consolidation
Evergy Kansas Central was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger and thus, the predecessor of Evergy. Evergy had separate operations for the period beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to Evergy. The results of Great Plains Energy's direct subsidiaries have been included in Evergy's results of operations from the date of the closing of the merger and thereafter.
Evergy Metro elected not to apply "push-down accounting" related to the merger, whereby the adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value and the resulting goodwill would be recorded on the financial statements of the acquired subsidiary. These adjustments for Evergy Metro, as well as those related to the acquired assets and liabilities of Great Plains Energy and its other direct subsidiaries, are only reflected on Evergy's consolidated financial statements.
Each of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements includes the accounts of their subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which they are the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in jointly-owned generation facilities are included on a proportionate basis. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).
Use of Estimates
The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.
Fuel Inventory and Supplies
The Evergy Companies record fuel inventory and supplies at average cost. The following table separately states the balances for fuel inventory and supplies.
Property, Plant and Equipment
The Evergy Companies record the value of property, plant and equipment, including that of VIEs, at cost. For plant, cost includes contracted services, direct labor and materials, indirect charges for engineering and supervision and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. AFUDC equity funds are included as a non-cash item in other income and AFUDC borrowed funds are a reduction of interest expense. AFUDC is computed by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress. The rates used to compute gross AFUDC are compounded semi-annually.
The amounts of the Evergy Companies' AFUDC for borrowed and equity funds are detailed in the following table.
(a) Evergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
The average rates used in the calculation of AFUDC are detailed in the following table.
When property units are retired or otherwise disposed, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Repair of property and replacement of items not considered to be units of property are expensed as incurred, except for planned refueling and maintenance outages at Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek). As authorized by regulators, the incremental maintenance cost incurred for such outages is deferred and amortized to expense ratably over the period between planned outages.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization of utility plant other than nuclear fuel is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of depreciable property based on rates approved by state regulatory authorities. Annual depreciation rates average approximately 3%. See Note 8 for more details. Nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense based on the quantity of heat produced during the generation of electricity.
The depreciable lives of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's property, plant and equipment are detailed in the following table.
Plant to be Retired, Net
When the Evergy Companies retire utility plant, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable an asset will be retired significantly in advance of its original expected useful life and in the near term, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset and a probable abandonment. If the asset is still in service, the net amount is classified as plant to be retired, net on the consolidated balance sheets. If the asset is no longer in service, the net amount is classified as a regulatory asset on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Evergy Companies must also assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining net book value of the abandonment. The net book value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandonment is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. An impairment charge, if any, would equal the difference between the remaining net book value of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from the asset.
Evergy Missouri West has determined that its November 2018 retirement of Sibley No. 3 Unit meets the criteria to be considered an abandonment. As of December 31, 2020, Evergy has classified the remaining Sibley No. 3 Unit net book value of $128.4 million as retired generation facilities within regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheet. This regulatory asset is reduced by approximately $9 million of annual amortization expense, which is an amount equal to the annual depreciation expense for the asset reflected in retail rates.
In October 2019, the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) granted the request of certain intervenors for an Accounting Authority Order (AAO) that requires Evergy Missouri West to record a regulatory liability for all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following the station's retirement in November 2018 for consideration in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case, which is expected to be completed no later than the end of 2022. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the AAO.
Evergy Missouri West expects that the MPSC's decision in its next rate case regarding the AAO could impact the valuation of its regulatory asset for retired generation facilities but as of December 31, 2020, has concluded that no impairment is required based on the relevant facts and circumstances.
Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Costs
Nuclear plant decommissioning cost estimates are based on either the immediate dismantlement method or the deferred dismantling method as determined by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and MPSC and include the costs of decontamination, dismantlement and site restoration. Based on these cost estimates, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro each contribute to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek. Related liabilities for decommissioning are included on Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated balance sheets in asset retirement obligations (AROs).
As a result of the authorized regulatory treatment and related regulatory accounting, differences between the decommissioning trust fund asset and the related ARO are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. See Note 7 for discussion of AROs including those associated with nuclear plant decommissioning costs.
Regulatory Accounting
Accounting standards are applied that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation. Accordingly, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent. See Note 5 for additional information concerning regulatory matters.
Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance
Amounts related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in other long-terms assets and are detailed in the following table for Evergy. Substantially all of Evergy's COLI-related balances relate to Evergy Kansas Central's COLI activity.
Increases in cash surrender value and death benefits are recorded in other income in the Evergy Companies' consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Interest expense incurred on policy loans is offset against the policy income. Income from death benefits is highly variable from period to period.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the following financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate that value.
Nuclear decommissioning trust fund - The Evergy Companies' nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models.
Pension plans - For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models.
Revenue Recognition
The Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have the right to invoice. Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates. The Evergy Companies' unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. See Note 4 for the balance of unbilled receivables for each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments. These items are excluded from revenue, and thus are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.
See Note 3 for additional details regarding revenue recognition from sales of electricity by the Evergy Companies.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Historical loss information generally provides the basis for the Evergy Companies' assessment of expected credit losses. The Evergy Companies use an aging of accounts receivable method to assess historical loss information. When historical experience may not fully reflect the Evergy Companies' expectations about the future, the Evergy Companies will adjust historical loss information, as necessary, to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical loss information.
Receivables are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible, which is based on a number of factors including specific facts surrounding an account and management's judgment.
Property Gains and Losses
Net gains and losses from the sale of assets and businesses and from asset impairments are recorded in operating expenses.
Asset Impairments
Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset to be held and used is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.
Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The annual test must be performed at the same time each year. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. See Note 6 for additional details on goodwill.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Evergy Companies recognize tax benefits based on a "more-likely-than-not" recognition threshold. In addition, the Evergy Companies recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.
Evergy files a consolidated federal income tax return as well as unitary and combined income tax returns in several state jurisdictions with Kansas and Missouri being the most significant. Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss. Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income tax provisions include taxes allocated based on their separate company's income or loss.
The Evergy Companies have established a net regulatory liability for future refunds to be made to customers for amounts collected from customers in excess of income taxes in current rates. Tax credits are recognized in the year
generated except for certain Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West investment tax credits that have been deferred and amortized over the remaining service lives of the related properties.
Other Income (Expense), Net
The table below shows the detail of other expense for each of the Evergy Companies.
(a) Evergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
Earnings Per Share
To compute basic earnings per share (EPS), Evergy divides net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS includes the effect of issuable common shares resulting from restricted share units (RSUs), performance shares and restricted stock. Evergy computes the dilutive effects of potential issuances of common shares using the treasury stock method.
The following table reconciles Evergy's basic and diluted EPS.
Anti-dilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2020 and 2019 were 127,884 RSUs and 785 RSUs, respectively. There were no anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2018.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information
(a) Evergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
Non-cash property, plant and equipment additions in 2020 for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro include a non-cash addition related to the revision in estimate of the Wolf Creek ARO liability in the third quarter of 2020. See Note 7 for more details.
See Note 2 for the non-cash information related to the merger transaction in 2018, including the fair value of Great Plains Energy's assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the issuance of Evergy common stock.
Dividends Declared
In February 2021, Evergy's Board of Directors (Evergy Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.535 per share on Evergy's common stock. The common dividend is payable March 22, 2021, to shareholders of record as of March 8, 2021.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Leases
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires an entity that is a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for lease payments on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Leases: Land
Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which permits entities to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 land easements that exist or expired before the entity's adoption of Topic 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases under Topic 840. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which updates narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU No. 2016-02. Also in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases: Targeted Improvements, which provides an optional transition method that allows entities to initially apply Topic 842 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without restating prior periods. In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20, Leases: Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, which is expected to reduce a lessor's implementation and ongoing costs associated with applying ASU No. 2016-02. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-01, Leases: Codification Improvements, which clarifies certain lessor accounting and interim reporting requirements. ASU No. 2016-02 and the subsequent amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and requires a modified retrospective transition approach with an option to either adjust or not adjust comparative periods.
The Evergy Companies adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019, without adjusting comparative periods for all leases existing as of January 1, 2019, by electing the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11. As a result, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded an increase to assets and liabilities of approximately $110 million, $40 million and $80 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have certain lease transactions between them for which the related assets and liabilities are eliminated at consolidated Evergy. The adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on the Evergy Companies consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and there was no cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Evergy Companies also elected a practical expedient to forgo reassessing existing or expired contracts as leases to determine whether each is in scope of Topic 842 and to forgo reassessing lease classification for existing and expired leases.
2. MERGER OF GREAT PLAINS ENERGY AND EVERGY KANSAS CENTRAL
Description of Merger Transaction
On June 4, 2018, Evergy completed the mergers contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement. As a result of the mergers, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Evergy Kansas Central, with Evergy Kansas Central surviving the merger. Following the completion of these mergers, Evergy Kansas Central and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Evergy.
The merger was structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange of shares that involved no premium paid or received with respect to either Great Plains Energy or Evergy Kansas Central. As a result of the closing of the merger transaction, each outstanding share of Great Plains Energy common stock was converted into 0.5981 shares of Evergy common stock and each outstanding share of Evergy Kansas Central common stock was converted into 1 share of Evergy common stock.
Accounting Charges and Deferrals Related to the Merger
The following pre-tax reductions of revenue, expenses and deferral were recognized following the consummation of the merger and are included in the Evergy Companies' consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for 2018.
Reductions of revenue related to customer bill credits and expenses related to charitable contributions and community support were incurred as a result of conditions in the MPSC and KCC merger orders and were recorded as liabilities in the amounts presented above following the consummation of the merger. Reductions of revenue for annual bill credits for Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas electric retail customers are recognized ratably in the twelve-month period preceding their payment.
Voluntary severance and accelerated equity compensation represent costs related to payments for voluntary severance and change in control plans, as well as the recording of unrecognized equity compensation costs and the incremental fair value associated with the vesting of outstanding Evergy Kansas Central equity compensation awards upon the consummation of the merger.
Other transaction and transition costs include merger success fees and fees for other outside services incurred.
Reallocation and deferral of merger transition costs represents the net reallocation of incurred merger transition costs between Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the subsequent deferral of these transition costs to a regulatory asset for future recovery in accordance with the KCC and MPSC merger orders.
Purchase Price
Based on an evaluation of the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, Evergy Kansas Central was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger. Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy's common stock shares were exchanged for Evergy common stock shares at the fixed exchange rate of 0.5981. The total consideration transferred in the merger is based on the closing stock price of Evergy Kansas Central on June 4, 2018, and is calculated as follows.
Great Plains Energy's equity compensation awards, including performance shares and restricted stock, were replaced by equivalent Evergy equity compensation awards subject to substantially the same terms and conditions upon the closing of the merger. In accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805, a portion of the fair value of these awards is attributable to the purchase price as it represents consideration transferred in the merger.
Purchase Price Allocation
The fair value of Great Plains Energy's assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 4, 2018, was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Third-party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of these assets and liabilities.
The significant assets and liabilities recorded at fair values as of the merger date include long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, pension and post-retirement plans, accumulated deferred income tax liabilities and certain other long-term assets and liabilities.
The majority of Great Plains Energy's operations were subject to the rate-setting authority of the MPSC, the KCC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and were accounted for pursuant to GAAP, including the accounting guidance for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost recovery provisions for Great Plains Energy's regulated operations provided revenue derived from costs including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Except for the significant assets and liabilities for which valuation adjustments were made as discussed above, the fair values of Great Plains Energy's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximated their carrying values and the assets and liabilities did not reflect any adjustments to these amounts other than for amounts not included in rate base. The difference between the fair value and pre-merger carrying amounts for Great Plains Energy's long-term debt, asset retirement obligations and pension and post-retirement plans that were related to regulated operations were recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill as of the merger date.
The final purchase price allocation to Great Plains Energy's assets and liabilities as of June 4, 2018, is detailed in the following table.
Impact of Merger
The impact of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries on Evergy's revenues in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018 was an increase of $1,661.1 million. The impact of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries on Evergy's net income attributable to Evergy in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018 was an increase of $236.2 million.
Evergy had incurred total merger-related costs, including reductions of revenue for customer bill credits, of $148.0 million for 2018.
Pro Forma Financial Information
The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Evergy as if the merger transactions had taken place on January 1, 2018. The unaudited pro forma information was calculated after applying Evergy's accounting policies and adjusting Great Plains Energy's results to reflect purchase accounting adjustments.
The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been achieved or the future consolidated results of operations of Evergy.
Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Great Plains Energy incurred non-recurring costs and a gain directly related to the merger that have been excluded in the 2018 pro forma earnings presented above. On an after-tax basis, these non-recurring merger-related costs and gain incurred by Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Great Plains Energy included:
•$74.7 million of certain after-tax merger-related transition and transaction costs;
•$44.4 million of after-tax reductions in operating revenues related to one-time customer bill credits; and
•$36.6 million of after-tax mark-to-market gains on interest rate swaps for which cash settlement was contingent upon the consummation of the merger.
3. REVENUE
Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's revenues disaggregated by customer class are summarized in the following tables.
(a) Evergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
Retail Revenues
The Evergy Companies' retail revenues are generated by the regulated sale of electricity to their residential, commercial and industrial customers within their franchised service territories. The Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice. Retail customers are billed monthly at the tariff rates approved by the KCC and MPSC based on customer kWh usage.
Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.
The Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments. These items are excluded from revenue, and thus not reflected on the statements of income and comprehensive income, for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.
Wholesale Revenues
The Evergy Companies' wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of wholesale power and capacity in circumstances when the power that the Evergy Companies generate is not required for customers in their service territory. These sales primarily occur within the SPP Integrated Marketplace. The Evergy Companies also purchase power from the SPP Integrated Marketplace and record sale and purchase activity on a net basis in wholesale revenue or fuel and purchased power expense. In addition, the Evergy Companies sell wholesale power and capacity through bilateral contracts to other counterparties, such as electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric utilities.
For both wholesale sales to the SPP Integrated Marketplace and through bilateral contracts, the Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of wholesale electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.
Wholesale sales within the SPP Integrated Marketplace are billed weekly based on the fixed transaction price determined by the market at the time of the sale and the MWh quantity purchased. Wholesale sales from bilateral contracts are billed monthly based on the contractually determined transaction price and the kWh quantity purchased.
Transmission Revenues
The Evergy Companies' transmission revenues are generated by the use of their transmission networks by the SPP. To enable optimal use of the diverse generating resources in the SPP region, the Evergy Companies, as well as other transmission owners, allow the SPP to access and operate their transmission networks. As new transmission lines are constructed, they are included in the transmission network available to the SPP. In exchange for providing access, the SPP pays the Evergy Companies consideration determined by formula rates approved by FERC, which include the cost to construct and maintain the transmission lines and a return on investment. The price for access to the Evergy Companies' transmission networks are updated annually based on projected costs. Projections are updated to actual costs and the difference is included in subsequent year's prices.
The Evergy Companies have different treatment for their legacy transmission facilities within the SPP, which results in different levels of transmission revenue being received from the SPP. Evergy Kansas Central's transmission revenues from SPP include amounts that Evergy Kansas Central pays to the SPP on behalf of its retail electric customers for the use of Evergy Kansas Central's legacy transmission facilities. These transmission revenues are mostly offset by SPP network transmission cost expense that Evergy Kansas Central pays on behalf of its retail customers. Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West do not pay the SPP for their retail customers’ use of the Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West legacy transmission facilities and correspondingly, their transmission revenues also do not reflect the associated transmission revenue from the SPP.
The Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of transmission service to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice. Transmission service to the SPP is billed monthly based on a fixed transaction price determined by FERC formula transmission rates along with other SPP-specific charges and the MW quantity purchased.
Industrial Steam and Other Revenues
Evergy's industrial steam and other revenues are primarily generated by the regulated sale of industrial steam to Evergy Missouri West's steam customers. Evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of industrial steam to its customers over time as the service is provided in the amount that it has the right to invoice. Steam customers are billed on a monthly basis at the tariff rate approved by the MPSC based on customer MMBtu usage.
4. RECEIVABLES
The Evergy Companies' receivables are detailed in the following table.
The Evergy Companies' other receivables at December 31, 2020 and 2019, consisted primarily of receivables from partners in jointly-owned electric utility plants, wholesale sales receivables and receivables related to alternative revenue programs. The Evergy Companies' other receivables also included receivables from contracts with customers as summarized in the following table.
The change in the Evergy Companies' allowance for credit losses is summarized in the following table.
Sale of Accounts Receivable
Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in their retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors. These sales are accounted for as secured borrowings with accounts receivable pledged as collateral and a corresponding short-term collateralized note payable recognized on the balance sheets. The Evergy Companies' accounts receivable pledged as collateral and the corresponding short-term collateralized note payable are summarized in the following table.
Each receivable sale facility expires in September 2021. Evergy Kansas Central's facility allows for $185.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of borrowings from mid-October through mid-June and then $200.0 million from mid-June through the expiration date of the facility. Evergy Metro's facility allows for $130.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of borrowings at any time. Evergy Missouri West's facility allows for $50.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of borrowings from mid-November through mid-June and then $65.0 million from mid-June through the expiration date of the facility.
5. RATE MATTERS AND REGULATION
KCC Proceedings
Evergy Kansas Central 2020 Transmission Delivery Charge (TDC)
In March 2020, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Kansas Central's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC transmission formula rate (TFR). The new prices were effective in April 2020 and are expected to increase Evergy Kansas Central's annual retail revenues by $3.5 million when compared to 2019.
Evergy Metro 2020 TDC
In April 2020, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Metro's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC TFR. The new prices were effective in May 2020 and are expected to decrease Evergy Metro's annual retail revenues by $2.7 million when compared to 2019.
Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro Earnings Review and Sharing Plan (ERSP)
As part of their merger settlement agreement with the KCC, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to participate in an ERSP for the years 2019 through 2022. Under the ERSP, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas jurisdiction are required to refund to customers 50% of annual earnings in excess of their authorized return on equity of 9.3% to the extent the excess earnings exceed the amount of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's annual merger bill credits for the year being measured.
Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's 2019 calculations of annual earnings did not exceed their authorized return on equity of 9.3% and therefore did not result in any customer refund obligations. These calculations were filed with the KCC in April 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro estimate their 2020 annual earnings will not result in a significant refund obligation. The final refund obligations for 2020, if any, will be decided by the KCC and could vary from the current estimates.
Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro COVID-19 AAO Request
In May 2020, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro filed a joint request for an AAO with the KCC that would allow for the extraordinary costs and lost revenues incurred by the companies, net of any COVID-19-related savings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to be considered for future recovery from customers as part of their next rate cases.
In July 2020, the KCC granted Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's request for an AAO as discussed above. As a result of the KCC's order, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro will record to a regulatory asset all net incremental costs incurred associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases, which are expected to be completed no later than the end of 2023. Additionally, the KCC order states that the KCC will also consider granting the recovery of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's lost revenues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as part of their next rate cases. If granted, these lost revenues would be recognized prospectively as billed to customers in future rates.
MPSC Proceedings
Evergy Missouri West Other Proceedings
In December 2018, the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) and the Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG) filed a petition with the MPSC requesting an AAO that would require Evergy Missouri West to record a regulatory liability for all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes, and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following the station’s retirement in November 2018.
In October 2019, the MPSC granted OPC's and MECG's request for an AAO and required Evergy Missouri West to record to a regulatory liability the revenues discussed above for consideration in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case, which is expected to be completed no later than the end of 2022. Depending on the MPSC's decision in this next rate case, Evergy Missouri West could be required to refund to customers all or a portion of amounts collected in revenue for Sibley Station since December 2018 or, alternatively, could be required to make no refunds.
As a result of the MPSC order, Evergy has recorded a regulatory liability of $18.4 million as of December 31, 2020 for the estimated amount of revenues that Evergy Missouri West has collected from customers for Sibley Station since December 2018 that Evergy has determined is probable of refund. Evergy expects that it will continue to defer such amounts as collected from customers until new rates become effective in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case.
The accrual for this estimated amount does not include certain revenues collected related to Sibley Station that Evergy has determined to not be probable of refund in the next rate case based on the relevant facts and
circumstances. While Evergy has determined these additional revenues to not be probable of refund, the ultimate resolution of this matter in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case is uncertain and could result in an estimated loss of up to approximately $12 million per year in excess of the amount accrued until Evergy Missouri West's new rates become effective. Evergy's regulatory liability for probable refunds as of December 31, 2020 and estimated loss in excess of the amount accrued represent estimates that could change significantly based on ongoing developments including decisions in other regulatory proceedings that establish precedent applicable to this matter and positions of parties on this issue in a future Evergy Missouri West rate case.
Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West COVID-19 AAO Request
In May 2020, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West filed a joint request for an AAO with the MPSC that would allow for the extraordinary costs and lost revenues incurred by the companies, net of any COVID-19-related savings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to be considered for future recovery from customers as part of their next rate cases.
In October 2020, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West entered into a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement with the MPSC staff and other intervenors that would allow Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The MPSC approved the AAO request in January 2021. As a result of the MPSC's order, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West will record the net incremental costs to a regulatory asset for consideration in their next rate cases, which are expected to be filed in January 2022.
FERC Proceedings
In October of each year, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro post an updated TFR that includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs for the following year. This rate is the most significant component in the retail rate calculation for Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's annual request with the KCC to adjust retail prices to include updated transmission costs through the TDC.
Evergy Kansas Central TFR
In the most recent three years, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Kansas Central's annual transmission revenues by approximately:
•$32.4 million increase effective in January 2021;
•$6.8 million increase effective in January 2020; and
•$11.2 million decrease effective in January 2019.
Evergy Metro TFR
In the most recent three years, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Metro's annual transmission revenues by approximately:
•$3.9 million decrease effective in January 2021;
•$1.7 million decrease effective in January 2020; and
•$2.8 million decrease effective in January 2019.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
The Evergy Companies have recorded assets and liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded if they were not regulated. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.
Management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to the Evergy Companies; and changes in laws and
regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. The Evergy Companies continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to any or all of the Evergy Companies' operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets.
The Evergy Companies' regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in the following tables.
The following summarizes the nature and period of recovery for each of the regulatory assets listed in the table above.
Pension and post-retirement costs: Represents unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs that will be recognized in future net periodic pension and post-retirement costs, pension settlements amortized over various periods and financial and regulatory accounting method differences that will be eliminated over the life of the pension plans. Of these amounts, $806.3 million, $412.9 million and $333.6 million for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, respectively, are not included in rate base and are amortized over various periods. Additionally, $250.1 million, $(27.5) million and $137.6 million for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, respectively, represent differences between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and pension and post-retirement costs for ratemaking that will be recovered or refunded in future rates and differences in accumulated unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs between Evergy and Evergy Metro due to Evergy Metro electing not to apply "push-down accounting" related to the merger.
Debt reacquisition costs: Includes costs incurred to reacquire and refinance debt. These costs are amortized over the term of the new debt or the remaining lives of the old debt issuances if no new debt was issued and are not included in rate base.
Debt fair value adjustment: Represents purchase accounting adjustments recorded to state the carrying value of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West long-term debt at fair value in connection with the merger. Amount is amortized over the life of the related debt and is not included in rate base.
Asset retirement obligations fair value adjustment: Represents purchase accounting adjustments recorded to state the carrying value of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West AROs at fair value in connection with the merger. Amount is amortized over the life of the related plant and is not included in rate base.
Depreciation: Represents the difference between regulatory depreciation expense and depreciation expense recorded for financial reporting purposes. These assets are included in rate base and the difference is amortized over the life of the related plant.
Cost of removal: Represents amounts spent, but not yet collected, to dispose of plant assets. This asset will decrease as removal costs are collected in rates and is included in rate base.
Asset retirement obligations: Represents amounts associated with AROs as discussed further in Note 7. These amounts are recovered over the life of the related plant and are not included in rate base.

Disallowed plant costs: The KCC originally disallowed certain costs related to the Wolf Creek plant. In 1987, the KCC revised its original conclusion and provided for recovery of an indirect disallowance with no return on investment. This regulatory asset represents the present value of the future expected revenues to be provided to recover these costs, net of the amounts amortized.
La Cygne environmental costs: Represents the deferral of depreciation and amortization expense and associated carrying charges related to the La Cygne Station environmental project. This amount will be amortized over the life of the related asset and is included in rate base.
Deferred customer programs: Represents costs related to various energy efficiency programs that have been accumulated and deferred for future recovery. Of these amounts, $10.6 million for Evergy and $8.6 million for Evergy Metro are not included in rate base and are amortized over various periods.

Jurisdictional allowance for funds used during construction: Represents AFUDC that is accrued subsequent to the time the associated construction charges are included in prices and prior to the time the related assets are placed in service. The AFUDC is amortized to depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset that is placed in service.
La Cygne leasehold dismantling costs: Represents amounts collected but not yet spent on the contractual obligation to dismantle a portion of La Cygne Unit 2. The obligation will be discharged as the unit is dismantled.
Cost of removal: Represents amount collected, but not yet spent, to dispose of plant assets. This liability will be discharged as removal costs are incurred.
Kansas tax credits: Represents Kansas tax credits on investment in utility plant. Amounts will be credited to customers subsequent to the realization of the credits over the remaining lives of the utility plant giving rise to the tax credits.

Fuel recovery mechanisms: Represents the amount collected from customers in excess of the actual cost of fuel consumed in producing electricity and the cost of purchased power. This difference is expected to be refunded over a one-year period and is not included in rate base.
Sibley AAO: Represents the estimated amount of revenues that Evergy Missouri West has collected from customers for Sibley Station that Evergy has determined is probable of refund. These amounts were recorded in connection with an AAO granted by the MPSC in October 2019 and deferred amounts will be considered by the MPSC in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case.
Other regulatory liabilities: Includes various regulatory liabilities that individually are relatively small in relation to the total regulatory liability balance. These amounts will be credited over various periods.
6. GOODWILL
Accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. Evergy's impairment test for the $2,336.6 million of goodwill that was recorded as a result of the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted as of May 1, 2020. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. The determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach
consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill.
7. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
AROs associated with tangible long-lived assets are legal obligations that exist under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. These liabilities are recognized at estimated fair value as incurred with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful lives. Accretion of the liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded to a regulatory asset and/or liability. Changes in the estimated fair values of the liabilities are recognized when known.
Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have AROs related to asbestos abatement and the closure and post-closure care of ponds and landfills containing coal combustion residuals (CCRs). In addition, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have AROs related to decommissioning Wolf Creek and the retirement of wind generation facilities.
The MPSC and KCC require the owners of Wolf Creek, including Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro with their respective 47% ownership shares, to submit an updated decommissioning cost study every three years. The most recent study was submitted to the MPSC and KCC in September 2020. As a result of changes in estimates related to the study, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded increases to their AROs to decommission Wolf Creek of $259.1 million, $140.7 million and $118.4 million, respectively, in 2020.
The following table summarizes the change in the Evergy Companies' AROs for the periods ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.
8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The following tables summarize the property, plant and equipment of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.
(a) As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, represents the planned retirement of Evergy Kansas Central analog meters prior to the end of their remaining useful lives.
The following table summarizes the property, plant and equipment of VIEs for Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central.
Depreciation Expense
The Evergy Companies' depreciation expense is detailed in the following table.
(a) Approximately $7.1 million of depreciation expense in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018 was attributable to property, plant and equipment of VIEs.
(b) Evergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
9. JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANTS
Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's share of jointly-owned electric utility plants at December 31, 2020, are detailed in the following tables.
(a) The VIE consolidated by Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central holds its 50% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2. This 50% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is reflected in the information provided above. See Note 19 for additional information.
(a) The VIE consolidated by Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central holds its 50% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2. This 50% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is reflected in the information provided above. See Note 19 for additional information.
Each owner must fund its own portion of the plant's operating expenses and capital expenditures. The Evergy Companies' share of direct expenses are included in the appropriate operating expense classifications in Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements.
10. PENSION PLANS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries maintain, and Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro participate in, qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's employees as well as certain non-qualified plans covering certain active and retired officers. Evergy is also responsible for its indirect 94% ownership share of Wolf Creek's defined benefit plans, consisting of Evergy Kansas South's and Evergy Metro's respective 47% ownership shares.
For the majority of employees, pension benefits under these plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement. However, for the plan covering Evergy Kansas Central's employees, the benefits for non-union employees hired between 2002 and the second quarter of 2018 and union employees hired beginning in 2012 are derived from a cash balance account formula. The plan was closed to future non-union employees in 2018. For the plans covering Evergy Metro's employees, the benefits for union employees hired beginning in 2014 are derived from a cash balance account formula and the plans were closed to future non-union employees in 2014.
Evergy and its subsidiaries also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro and their respective shares of Wolf Creek's post-retirement benefit plans.
The Evergy Companies record pension and post-retirement expense in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC that allow the difference between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and costs for ratemaking to be recognized as a regulatory asset or liability. This difference between financial and regulatory accounting methods is due to timing and will be eliminated over the life of the plans.
For 2020, Evergy and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement charges of $11.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively. For 2019, Evergy and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement charges of $15.6 million and $23.0 million, respectively. These settlement charges were the result of accelerated pension distributions primarily related to voluntary severance programs. Evergy and Evergy Metro deferred substantially all of the charges to a regulatory asset and expect to recover these amounts over future periods pursuant to regulatory agreements.
The following pension benefits tables provide information relating to the funded status of all defined benefit pension plans on an aggregate basis as well as the components of net periodic benefit costs. For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value. Net periodic benefit costs reflect total plan benefit costs prior to the effects of capitalization and sharing with joint owners of power plants. Evergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
Actuarial losses for the Evergy Companies' pension benefit plans for 2020 and 2019 were primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation of approximately 70 basis points in each of 2020 and 2019 as a result of lower market interest rates.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy's pension benefits include non-qualified benefit obligations of $52.1 million and $49.4 million, respectively, which are funded by trusts containing assets of $46.3 million and $45.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy Kansas Central's pension benefits include non-qualified benefit obligations of $27.0 million and $26.0 million, respectively, which are funded by trusts containing
assets of $32.7 million and $31.7 million, respectively. The assets in the aforementioned trusts are not included in the table above. See Note 14 for more information on these amounts.
For financial reporting purposes, the estimated prior service cost and net actuarial (gain) loss for the defined benefit plans are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) or a regulatory asset into net periodic benefit cost. The Evergy Companies amortize prior service cost on a straight-line basis over the average future service of the active employees (plan participants) benefiting under the plan. Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central amortize the net actuarial (gain) loss on a straight-line basis over the average future service of active plan participants benefiting under the plan without application of an amortization corridor. Evergy Metro amortizes the net actuarial (gain) loss on a rolling five-year average basis.
Pension and other post-retirement benefit plans with the PBO, accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) or accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation (APBO) in excess of the fair value of plan assets at year-end are detailed in the following tables.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the Evergy Companies' estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans' investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns of various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolios was developed and adjusted for the effect of projected benefits paid from plan assets and future plan contributions.
The following tables provide the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs for the Evergy Companies' pension and post-retirement benefit plans.
Evergy expects to contribute $131.6 million to the pension plans in 2021 to meet Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) funding requirements and regulatory orders, of which $41.2 million is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and $90.4 million is expected to be paid by Evergy Metro. The Evergy Companies' funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the ERISA funding requirements and MPSC and KCC rate orders plus additional amounts as considered appropriate; therefore, actual contributions may differ from expected contributions. Also in 2021, Evergy expects to contribute $4.1 million to the post-retirement benefit plans, of which $0.6 million is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and $3.5 million is expected to be paid by Evergy Metro.
The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid through 2030.
As of December 31, 2020, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro each maintained separate trusts for both their qualified pension and post-retirement benefits. These plans are managed in accordance with prudent investor guidelines contained in the ERISA requirements.
The primary objective of the Evergy Kansas Central pension plan is to provide a source of retirement income for its participants and beneficiaries, and the primary financial objective of the plan is to improve its funded status. The primary objective of the Evergy Kansas Central post-retirement benefit plan is growth in assets and the preservation of principal, while minimizing interim volatility, to meet anticipated claims of plan participants.
The primary objective of the Evergy Metro pension plans is to meet or exceed the target rate of return for the plan within a reasonable and prudent level of risk. The primary objective of the Evergy Metro post-retirement benefit plans is to preserve capital, maintain sufficient liquidity and earn a consistent rate of return.
The investment strategies of both the Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro pension and post-retirement plans support the above objectives of the plans. The portfolios are invested, and periodically rebalanced, to achieve the targeted allocations detailed below. The following table provides the target asset allocations by asset class for the Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro pension and other post-retirement plan assets. [to be updated]

The fair values of the Evergy Companies' pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category are in the following tables.
The fair values of the Evergy Companies' post-retirement plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category are in the following tables.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. The cost trend assumptions are detailed in the following tables.
Employee Savings Plans
Evergy has defined contribution savings plans (401(k)) that cover substantially all employees. Evergy matches employee contributions, subject to limits. The annual costs of the plans are detailed in the following table. Evergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
11. EQUITY COMPENSATION
Upon the consummation of the merger, Evergy assumed both Evergy Kansas Central's Long-Term Incentive and Share Award plan (LTISA) and Great Plains Energy's Amended Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was renamed the Evergy, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan. All outstanding share-based payment awards under Evergy Kansas Central's LTISA vested at the closing of the merger transaction and were converted into a right to receive Evergy common stock with the exception of certain RSUs and deferred director share units issued prior to the closing of the merger to certain directors, officers and employees of Evergy Kansas Central. The vesting of these shares resulted in the recognition of $14.6 million of compensation expense in Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for 2018.
All of Great Plains Energy's outstanding performance shares, restricted stock, RSUs and director deferred share units under Great Plains Energy's Amended Long-Term Incentive Plan were converted into equivalent Evergy performance shares, restricted stock, RSUs and director deferred share units at Great Plains Energy's merger exchange ratio of 0.5981. See Note 2 for more information regarding the merger.
The following table summarizes the Evergy Companies' equity compensation expense and the associated income tax benefit.
(a) Evergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
Restricted Share Units
Evergy has utilized RSUs for new grants of stock-based compensation awards subsequent to the merger. RSU awards are grants that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock as the awards vest. These RSU awards are defined as nonvested shares and do not include restrictions once the awards have vested. These RSUs either take the form of RSUs with performance measures that vest upon expiration of the award term or RSUs with only service requirements that vest solely upon the passage of time. As of December 31, 2020, Evergy also had an insignificant amount of restricted stock and performance shares outstanding related to Great Plains Energy equity compensation awards that converted to equivalent Evergy awards at the closing of the merger transaction in 2018. These remaining restricted stock and performance share awards will vest in the first quarter of 2021.
RSUs with Performance Measures
The payment of RSUs with performance measures is contingent upon achievement of specific performance goals over a stated period of time as approved by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board. The numbers of RSUs with performances measures ultimately paid can vary from the numbers of RSUs with performance measures initially granted depending on Evergy's performance over stated performance periods. Compensation expense for RSUs with performance measures is calculated by recognizing the portion of the fair value for each reporting period for which the requisite service has been rendered. Dividends are accrued over the vesting period and paid in cash based on the number of RSUs with performance measures ultimately paid.
The fair value of RSUs with performance measures is estimated using the market value of Evergy's stock at the valuation date and a Monte Carlo simulation technique that incorporates assumptions for inputs of expected volatilities, dividend yield and risk-free rates. Expected volatility is based on daily stock price change during a historical period commensurate with the remaining term of the performance period of the grant. The risk-free rate is based upon the rate at the time of the evaluation for zero-coupon government bonds with a maturity consistent with the remaining performance period of the grant. The dividend yield is based on the most recent dividends paid and the actual closing stock price on the valuation date. For shares granted in 2020, inputs for expected volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free rate were 17%, 2.93% and 0.72%, respectively.
RSU activity for awards with performance measures for 2020 is summarized in the following table.
* weighted-average
At December 31, 2020, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with performance measures was 1.7 years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with performance measures was $87.98 and $37.87 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, there was $17.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs with performance measures. No RSUs with performance measures vested in 2020 and 2019.
RSUs with Only Service Requirements
Evergy measures the fair value of RSUs with only service requirements based on the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. RSU awards with only service conditions recognize compensation expense by multiplying shares by the grant-date fair value related to the RSU and recognizing it on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, including for those RSUs that have a graded vesting schedule. Nonforfeitable dividend equivalents, or the rights to receive cash equal to the value of dividends paid on Evergy's common stock, are paid on certain of these RSUs during the vesting period. Nonforfeitable dividend equivalents are recorded directly to retained earnings.
RSU activity for awards with only service requirements for 2020 is summarized in the following table.
* weighted-average
At December 31, 2020, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with only service requirements was 1.3 years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with only service requirements was $68.92, $54.47 and $52.16 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020, there was $3.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs. The total fair value of RSUs with only service requirements that vested was $6.5 million, $2.6 million and $16.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
12. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND SHORT-TERM BANK LINES OF CREDIT
Evergy's $2.5 billion master credit facility expires in 2023. Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility with specific sublimits for each borrower. These sublimits can be unilaterally adjusted by Evergy for each borrower provided the sublimits remain within minimum and maximum sublimits as specified in the facility. A default by any borrower under the facility or one of its significant subsidiaries on other indebtedness totaling more than $100.0 million constitutes a default by that borrower under the facility. Under the terms of this facility, each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the facility, of not greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at all times. As of December 31, 2020, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West were in compliance with this covenant.
The following table summarizes the committed credit facilities (excluding receivable sale facilities discussed in Note 4) available to the Evergy Companies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
13. LONG-TERM DEBT
The Evergy Companies' long-term debt is detailed in the following tables.
(a)Rate after amortizing gains/losses recognized in OCI on settlements of interest rate hedging instruments.
(b)Variable rate.
(c)Evergy's current maturities total as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes $4.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of fair value adjustments recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the merger transaction.
(d)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, does not include $50.0 million and $21.9 million of secured Series 2005 Environmental Improvement Revenue Refunding (EIRR) bonds because the bonds were repurchased in September 2015 and are held by Evergy Metro.
(e)Represents the fair value adjustments recorded at Evergy consolidated related to the long-term debt of Great Plains Energy, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West in connection with purchase accounting for the merger transaction. This amount is not part of future principal payments and will amortize over the remaining life of the associated debt instruments.
(f)Originally issued by Great Plains Energy but assumed by Evergy, Inc. as part of the merger transaction.
(g)Effectively secured pursuant to the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of December 1, 1986, as supplemented (Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture) through the issuance of collateral mortgage bonds to the trustee in 2019.
The following table summarizes Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's long-term debt of VIEs.
Mortgage Bonds
The Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds (FMBs) that could be issued by each entity. Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South must be in compliance with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness. The amount of Evergy Kansas Central FMBs authorized by its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1939, as supplemented, is subject to certain limitations as described below. The amount of Evergy Kansas South FMBs authorized by the Evergy Kansas South Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented and amended, is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion, unless amended further. FMBs are secured by utility assets. Amounts of additional FMBs that may be issued are subject to property, earnings and certain restrictive provisions, except in connection with certain refundings, of each mortgage. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $780.6 million and $2,828.6 million principal amounts of additional Evergy Kansas Central FMBs or Evergy Kansas South FMBs, respectively, could be issued under the most restrictive provisions of their mortgages.
Evergy Metro has issued mortgage bonds under the Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture, which creates a mortgage lien on substantially all Evergy Metro's utility plant. Additional Evergy Metro bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $4,733.1 million principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.
Evergy Missouri West has issued mortgage bonds under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated April 1, 1946, as supplemented, which creates a mortgage lien on a portion of Evergy Missouri West's utility plant.
In April 2020, Evergy Kansas Central issued, at a discount, $500.0 million of 3.45% FMBs, maturing in 2050 and issued a notice of redemption for its $250.0 million of 5.10% FMBs, which had an original maturity date of July 2020. The proceeds from the issuance of Evergy Kansas Central's $500.0 million of 3.45% FMBs were used to redeem the $250.0 million of 5.10% FMBs in May 2020 and for general corporate purposes.
In May 2020, Evergy Metro issued, at a discount, $400.0 million of 2.25% Mortgage Bonds, maturing in 2030. The proceeds from the issuance of Evergy Metro's $400.0 million of 2.25% Mortgage Bonds were used to repay a portion of Evergy Metro's borrowings under the master credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
Senior Notes
Under the terms of the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes, Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, not greater than 0.65 to 1.00. In addition, Evergy Missouri West's priority debt, as defined in the agreements, cannot exceed 15% of consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreements. At December 31, 2020, Evergy Missouri West was in compliance with these covenants.
Scheduled Maturities
Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's long-term debt maturities and the long-term debt maturities of VIEs for the next five years are detailed in the following table.
(a) Excludes long-term debt maturities of VIEs.
14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Values of Financial Instruments
GAAP establishes a hierarchical framework for disclosing the transparency of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels. In addition, the Evergy Companies measure certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at NAV, which are not included in the fair value hierarchy. Further explanation of these levels and NAV is summarized below.
Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on public exchanges.
Level 2 - Pricing inputs are not quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are certain marketable debt securities, financial instruments traded in less than active markets or other financial instruments priced with models using highly observable inputs.
Level 3 - Significant inputs to pricing have little or no transparency. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation.
NAV - Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at NAV. These investments do not consider the observability of inputs and, therefore, they are not included within the fair value hierarchy. The Evergy Companies include in this category investments in private equity, real estate and alternative investment funds that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The underlying alternative investments include collateralized debt obligations, mezzanine debt and a variety of other investments.
The Evergy Companies record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and short-term borrowings on their consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Interest Rate Derivatives
The Evergy Companies are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to manage these risks. From time to time, risk management activities may include entering into interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. These interest rate swap agreements can be designated as cash flow hedges, in which case gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in other comprehensive income to be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings. The Evergy Companies classify all cash inflows and outflows for interest rate swap agreements accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted debt transactions as financing activities on their consolidated statements of cash flows.
In September 2019, Evergy issued $800.0 million of 2.90% Senior Notes maturing in 2029 and paid $69.8 million to settle an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500.0 million that was designated as a cash
flow hedge of interest payments on the debt issuance. The $69.8 million pre-tax loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet and is being reclassified to interest expense over the ten-year term of the debt. For 2020, $7.0 million and $(4.0) million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense and income tax expense, respectively, on Evergy's consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For 2019, $2.0 million and $(0.5) million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense and income tax expense, respectively, on Evergy's consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2020, Evergy expects to amortize $5.4 million to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss over the next twelve months.
Fair Value of Long-Term Debt
The Evergy Companies measure the fair value of long-term debt using Level 2 measurements available as of the measurement date. The book value and fair value of the Evergy Companies' long-term debt and long-term debt of variable interest entities is summarized in the following table.
(a) Includes current maturities.
(b) Book value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes $110.4 million and $125.5 million, respectively, of fair value adjustments recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger, which are not part of future principal payments and will amortize over the remaining life of the associated debt instrument.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The following tables include the Evergy Companies' balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
(a)Fair value is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trust and/or valuation models.
(b)Fair value is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trust. Debt securities classified as Level 1 are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities. Debt securities classified as Level 2 are comprised of corporate bonds, U.S. Agency, state and local obligations, and other asset-backed securities.
Certain Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central investments included in the table above are measured at NAV as they do not have readily determinable fair values. In certain situations, these investments may have redemption restrictions.
The following table provides additional information on these Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central investments.
(a)This investment is in five long-term private equity funds that do not permit early withdrawal. Investments in these funds cannot be distributed until the underlying investments have been liquidated, which may take years from the date of initial liquidation. Three funds have begun to make distributions. The initial investment in the fourth and fifth funds occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively. The fourth fund's term is 15 years, subject to the general partner's right to extend the term for up to three additional one-year periods. The fifth fund's term is 15 years, subject to additional extensions approved by a fund advisory committee to provide for an orderly liquidation of fund investments and dissolution of the fund.
(b)There is a holdback on final redemptions.
(c)This investment can be redeemed immediately and is not subject to any restrictions on redemptions.
The Evergy Companies hold equity and debt investments classified as securities in various trusts including for the purposes of funding the decommissioning of Wolf Creek and for the benefit of certain retired executive officers of Evergy Kansas Central. The Evergy Companies record net realized and unrealized gains and losses on the nuclear decommissioning trusts in regulatory liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets and record net realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Evergy Companies' rabbi trusts in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
The following table summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) for the Evergy Companies' nuclear decommissioning trusts and rabbi trusts.
(a) Evergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Matters
Set forth below are descriptions of contingencies related to environmental matters that may impact the Evergy Companies' operations or their financial results. Management's assessment of these contingencies, which are based on federal and state statutes and regulations, and regulatory agency and judicial interpretations and actions, has evolved over time. These laws, regulations, interpretations and actions can also change, restrict or otherwise impact the Evergy Companies' operations or financial results. The failure to comply with these laws, regulations, interpretations and actions could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and/or the imposition of remedial requirements. The Evergy Companies believe that all of their operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.
There are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies' operations and consolidated financial results. Due in part to the complex nature of environmental laws and regulations, the Evergy Companies are unable to assess the impact of potential changes that may develop with respect to the environmental contingencies described below.
Cross-State Air Pollution Update Rule
In September 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution (CSAPR) Update Rule. The final rule addresses interstate transport of nitrogen oxides emissions in 22 states including Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the ozone season and the impact from the formation of ozone on downwind states with respect to the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In December 2018, the EPA finalized a determination, known as the CSAPR Close-Out Rule, demonstrating the CSAPR Update Rule fully addressed certain upwind states' 2008 ozone NAAQS interstate transport obligations. Various states and others have challenged both the CSAPR Update Rule and the CSAPR Close-Out Rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit). In the fourth quarter of 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted these petitions and remanded a portion of the CSAPR Update Rule back to the EPA and vacated the CSAPR Close-Out Rule in its entirety.
In response to the remand by the D.C. Circuit, the EPA proposed the Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS in October 2020. The proposal finds that nine of the states that were subject to the CSAPR Update Rule do not significantly contribute to downwind states' nonattainment and/or maintenance issues during the ozone season, and that these states are therefore currently not subject to this proposed rule. These nine states are Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin. The Evergy
Companies will continue to monitor this proposed rule as any future changes to their NOx ozone season allowance allocations could be material.
Greenhouse Gases
Burning coal and other fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gases referred to as greenhouse gases (GHG). Various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) limit CO2 and other GHG emissions, and in addition, other measures are being imposed or offered by individual states, municipalities and regional agreements with the goal of reducing GHG emissions.
In July 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in the Federal Register. This rule contained (1) emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing electric utility generating units (EGUs) and (2) revisions to emission guideline implementing regulations. This rule defined the "best system of emission reduction" (BSER) for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired EGUs as on-site, heat-rate efficiency improvements. The final rule also provided states with a list of candidate technologies that can be used to establish standards of performance and incorporate these performance standards into state plans. In conjunction with the finalization of the ACE rule, the EPA repealed its previously adopted Clean Power Plan (CPP). In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE rule back to the EPA. Absent an approved request for rehearing, the mandate becomes effective on March 12, 2021. In February 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion filed by the EPA for a partial stay of its January 2021 vacatur discussed above. The partial stay leaves the vacatur of the ACE rule in place while staying the mandate that vacates the repeal of the CPP. As a result of the partial stay, neither the ACE rule nor the CPP will be in effect while the EPA forms a new rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
Due to uncertainty regarding the future of the CPP or any other GHG regulation, the Evergy Companies cannot determine the impact of the rule on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply with the ACE rule, CPP, or other potential GHG rule, could be material.
Water
The Evergy Companies discharge some of the water used in generation and other operations containing substances deemed to be pollutants. A November 2015 EPA rule establishes effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) and standards for wastewater discharges, including limits on the amount of toxic metals and other pollutants that can be discharged. Implementation timelines for this 2015 rule vary from 2018 to 2023. In April 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit (5th Circuit) issued a ruling that vacates and remands portions of the original ELG rule. Due to this ruling, future ELG modifications for the best available technology economically achievable for the discharge of legacy wastewater and leachate are likely and could be material.
In October 2020, the EPA published the final ELG reconsideration rule. This rule adjusts numeric limits for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater and adds a 10% volumetric purge limit for bottom ash transport water. The timeline for final FGD wastewater compliance is now as soon as possible on or after one year following publication of the final rule in the Federal Register but no later than December 31, 2025. The Evergy Companies have reviewed the regulation and the costs to comply with these changes are not expected to be material.
Regulation of Coal Combustion Residuals
In the course of operating their coal generation plants, the Evergy Companies produce coal combustion residuals (CCRs), including fly ash, gypsum and bottom ash. The EPA published a rule to regulate CCRs in April 2015 that requires additional CCR handling, processing and storage equipment and closure of certain ash disposal units.
In March 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling to grant the EPA's request to remand the Phase I, Part I CCR rule in response to a prior court ruling requiring the EPA to address un-lined surface impoundment closure requirements. In August 2020, the EPA published the Part A CCR Rule. This rule reclassified clay-lined surface impoundments from "lined" to "un-lined" and established a deadline of April 11, 2021 to initiate closure. The prior rule included a deadline of October 31, 2020 for un-lined impoundments to initiate closure. In November 2020, the EPA published the final Part B CCR Rule. This rule includes a process to allow un-lined impoundments to continue to operate if a demonstration is made to prove that the un-lined impoundments are not adversely impacting groundwater, human
health or the environment. The Evergy Companies currently plan to initiate closure of all un-lined impoundments by the deadline in the Part A CCR rule and therefore the Part B CCR rule is not expected to have a material impact.
The Evergy Companies have recorded AROs for their current estimates for the closure of ash disposal ponds, but the revision of these AROs may be required in the future due to changes in existing CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring of CCR units or changes in interpretation of existing CCR regulations or changes in the timing or cost to close ash disposal ponds. If revisions to these AROs are necessary, the impact on the Evergy Companies' operations or consolidated financial results could be material.
Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel
Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. In 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to withdraw its application to construct a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The NRC has not yet issued a final decision on the matter.
Wolf Creek is constructing a dry cask storage facility to expand its existing on-site spent nuclear fuel storage, which is expected to provide additional capacity by the end of 2021. The Evergy Companies expect that the majority of the costs to construct the dry cask storage facility that would not have otherwise been incurred had the DOE begun accepting spent nuclear fuel will be reimbursed by the DOE. The Evergy Companies cannot predict, when, or if, an off-site storage site or alternative disposal site will be available to receive Wolf Creek's spent nuclear fuel and will continue to monitor this activity.
Nuclear Insurance
Nuclear liability, property and accidental outage insurance is maintained for Wolf Creek. These policies contain certain industry standard terms, conditions and exclusions, including, but not limited to, ordinary wear and tear and war. An industry aggregate limit of $3.2 billion for nuclear events ($1.8 billion of non-nuclear events) plus any reinsurance, indemnity or any other source recoverable by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), provider of property and accidental outage insurance, exists for acts of terrorism affecting Wolf Creek or any other NEIL insured plant within 12 months from the date of the first act. In addition, participation is required in industry-wide retrospect assessment programs as discussed below.
Nuclear Liability Insurance
Pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, liability insurance includes coverage against public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the required limit of public liability, which is approximately $13.8 billion. This limit of liability consists of the maximum available commercial insurance of $0.5 billion and the remaining $13.3 billion is provided through mandatory participation in an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. Under this retrospective assessment program, the owners of Wolf Creek are jointly and severally subject to an assessment of up to $137.6 million (Evergy's share is $129.4 million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $64.7 million), payable at no more than $20.5 million (Evergy's share is $19.2 million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $9.6 million) per incident per year per reactor for any commercial U.S. nuclear reactor qualifying incident. Both the total and yearly assessment is subject to an inflationary adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index and applicable premium taxes. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose additional revenue-raising measures to pay claims.
Nuclear Property and Accidental Outage Insurance
The owners of Wolf Creek carry decontamination liability, nuclear property damage and premature nuclear decommissioning liability insurance for Wolf Creek totaling approximately $2.8 billion. Insurance coverage for non-nuclear property damage accidents total approximately $2.3 billion. In the event of an extraordinary nuclear accident, insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination in accordance with a plan mandated by the NRC. The Evergy Companies' share of any remaining proceeds can be used to pay for property damage or, if certain requirements are met, including decommissioning the plant, toward a shortfall in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund. The owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to help cover costs of replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek. If significant losses were incurred at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL
policies, the owners of Wolf Creek may be subject to retrospective assessments under the current policies of approximately $33.2 million (Evergy's share is $31.2 million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $15.6 million).
Nuclear Insurance Considerations
Although the Evergy Companies maintain various insurance policies to provide coverage for potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or an extended outage, the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended outage at Wolf Creek. Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent not recoverable in prices, would have a material effect on the Evergy Companies' consolidated financial results.
Contractual Commitments - Fuel, Power and Other
The Evergy Companies' contractual commitments at December 31, 2020, excluding pensions, long-term debt and leases, are detailed in the following tables. See Notes 10, 13 and 21 for information regarding pension, long-term debt and lease commitments, respectively.
Fuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation. Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements, capacity purchases and firm transmission service. Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.
16. GUARANTEES
In the ordinary course of business, Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.
At December 31, 2020, Evergy has provided $140.0 million of credit support for certain of its subsidiaries as follows:
•Evergy direct guarantees to Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro counterparties for certain fuel supply contracts totaling $48.0 million, which expire in 2027; and
•Evergy's guarantee of Evergy Missouri West long-term debt totaling $92.0 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2023.
Evergy has also guaranteed Evergy Missouri West's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2020, Evergy Missouri West had $65.0 million of commercial paper outstanding. None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings were downgraded.
17. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS

the closing of the merger, and thereafter.
Money Pool
Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are authorized to participate in the Evergy, Inc. money pool, which is an internal financing arrangement in which funds may be lent on a short-term basis to Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West from Evergy, Inc. and between Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West. At December 31, 2020, Evergy Metro had a $100.0 million outstanding receivable from Evergy Missouri West and no outstanding payables under the money pool. At December 31, 2019, Evergy Metro had no outstanding receivables or payables under the money pool.
Related Party Net Receivables and Payables
The following table summarizes Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's related party net receivables and payables.
Tax Allocation Agreement
Evergy files a consolidated federal income tax return as well as unitary and combined income tax returns in several state jurisdictions with Kansas and Missouri being the most significant. Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss. The following table summarizes Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income taxes receivable from (payable to) Evergy.
Leases
Evergy Metro leases certain transmission equipment from Evergy Kansas Central. This lease was entered into prior to the merger in an arms-length transaction and is accounted for as an operating lease. The right-of-use asset related to this lease is recorded within other long-term assets and the current and long-term lease liabilities are recorded within other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. The assets and liabilities related to this lease between Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro are eliminated at consolidated Evergy. The following table summarizes Evergy Metro's right-of-use assets and related liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet.
18. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Evergy's authorized capital stock consists of 600 million shares of common stock, without par value, and 12 million shares of Preference Stock, without par value.
Evergy Registration Statements
In November 2018, Evergy filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC, which expires in November 2021.
Evergy has registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. Shares issued under the plan may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market.
Evergy has registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for the Evergy, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan. Shares issued under the plans may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market.
Securities Purchase Agreement
On February 25, 2021, Evergy entered into a securities purchase agreement, by and between Evergy and an affiliate of Bluescape Energy Partners, LLC (Bluescape). Bluescape has agreed to purchase 2,269,447 shares of Evergy’s common stock for approximately $113.2 million and will receive a warrant to purchase up to 3,950,000 additional shares of Evergy’s common stock, in each case subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The warrant will have a term of three years and an exercise price equal to $64.70.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
In July 2018, the Evergy Board authorized the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of Evergy's common stock with no expiration date. Following its authorization, Evergy utilized various methods to effectuate the share repurchase program, including the repurchase of shares through accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements and open market transactions. In total, Evergy repurchased $2,671.0 million, or 45.2 million shares, of common stock under the repurchase program. Evergy retires repurchased common stock shares in the period the shares are repurchased.
The following table summarizes the ASRs completed as part of Evergy's common stock repurchase program.
Under the ASR agreements entered into with various financial institutions, Evergy was delivered a number of shares of its common stock based on the amount of the ASR agreement and the average daily volume-weighted average price of its common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a negotiated discount. Evergy reflects ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period the shares are delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. Evergy's ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.
Dividend Restrictions
Evergy depends on its subsidiaries to pay dividends on its common stock. The Evergy Companies have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels or the ability to pay dividends.
The KCC order authorizing the merger transaction requires Evergy to maintain consolidated common equity of at least 35% of total consolidated capitalization.
Under the Federal Power Act, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings. Certain conditions in the MPSC and KCC orders authorizing the merger
transaction also require Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro to maintain consolidated common equity of at least 40% of total capitalization. Other conditions in the MPSC and KCC merger orders require Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to maintain credit ratings of at least investment grade. If Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's or Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings are downgraded below the investment grade level as a result of their affiliation with Evergy or any of Evergy's affiliates, the impacted utility shall not pay a dividend to Evergy without KCC or MPSC approval or until the impacted utility's investment grade credit rating has been restored.
The master credit facility of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes contain covenants requiring the respective company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00 at all times.
As of December 31, 2020, all of Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's retained earnings and net income were free of restrictions and Evergy Metro had a retained earnings restriction of $385.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, Evergy's subsidiaries had restricted net assets of approximately $5.7 billion. These restrictions are not expected to affect the Evergy Companies' ability to pay dividends at the current level for the foreseeable future.
19. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
In determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Evergy Companies assess the entity's purpose and design, including the nature of the entity's activities and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. A reporting enterprise is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. The trust holding an 8% interest in JEC was a VIE until the expiration of a purchase option in July 2017 and then became a VIE again during 2019 until the 8% interest was purchased by Evergy Kansas Central in August 2019. The trust holding Evergy Kansas Central's 50% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is a VIE and Evergy Kansas Central remains the primary beneficiary of the trust.
All involvement with entities by the Evergy Companies is assessed to determine whether such entities are VIEs and, if so, whether or not the Evergy Companies are the primary beneficiaries of the entities. The Evergy Companies also continuously assess whether they are the primary beneficiary of the VIE with which they are involved. Prospective changes in facts and circumstances may cause identification of the primary beneficiary to be reconsidered.
8% Interest in JEC
Under an agreement that expired in August 2019, Evergy Kansas Central leased an 8% interest in JEC from a trust. The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust. The trust was created specifically to purchase the 8% interest in JEC and lease it to a third party and did not hold any other assets. Evergy Kansas Central met the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust until July 2017, when a contractual option to purchase the 8% interest in the plant covered by the lease expired. Accordingly, Evergy Kansas Central deconsolidated the trust in 2017. Evergy Kansas Central then reconsolidated the trust as a VIE in the first quarter of 2019 following an agreement with the owner to purchase the 8% interest in JEC from the trust in August 2019. Evergy Kansas Central deconsolidated the trust for the final time following the closing of this purchase in August 2019.
50% Interest in La Cygne Unit 2
Under an agreement that expires in September 2029, Evergy Kansas Central entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a trust under which the trust purchased Evergy Kansas Central's 50% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and subsequently leased it back to Evergy Kansas Central. The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust. The trust was created specifically to purchase the 50% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and lease it back to Evergy Kansas Central and does not hold any other assets. Evergy Kansas Central meets the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust. In determining the primary
beneficiary of the trust, Evergy Kansas Central concluded that the activities of the trust that most significantly impact its economic performance and that Evergy Kansas Central has the power to direct include (1) the operation and maintenance of the 50% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and (2) Evergy Kansas Central's ability to exercise a purchase option at the end of the agreement at the lesser of fair value or a fixed amount. Evergy Kansas Central has the potential to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant if the fair value of the 50% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 at the end of the agreement is greater than the fixed amount.
The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to the VIE described above that are recorded on Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated balance sheets.
(a)Included in accrued interest on Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated balance sheets.
All of the liabilities noted in the table above relate to the purchase of the property, plant and equipment of the VIE. The assets of the VIE can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and the VIE's debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central. Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central have not provided financial or other support to the VIE and are not required to provide such support. Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central did not record any gain or loss upon the initial consolidation of the VIE.

Deferred Income Taxes
The tax effects of major temporary differences resulting in deferred income tax assets (liabilities) in the consolidated balance sheets is in the following table.
Tax Credit Carryforwards
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy had $379.6 million and $379.0 million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy Kansas Central had $176.5 million and $168.8 million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy Metro had $195.9 million and $203.2 million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards. The carryforwards for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro relate primarily to wind production tax credits and advanced coal investment tax credits and expire in the years 2020 to 2040. Approximately $0.2 million of Evergy's credits are related to Low Income Housing credits that were acquired in Great Plains Energy's acquisition of Evergy Missouri West. Due to federal limitations on the utilization of income tax attributes acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition, Evergy expects a portion of these credits to expire unutilized and has provided a valuation allowance against $0.2 million of the federal income tax benefit.
The year of origin of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's related tax benefit amounts for federal tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2020 are detailed in the following table.
At December 31, 2019, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro had $169.9 million, $168.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to state income tax credit carryforwards. The state income tax credits relate primarily to the Kansas high performance incentive program tax credits. As a result of the exemption from Kansas state income tax beginning in 2021, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro wrote down their Kansas state income tax credit carryforwards in 2020, which were primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in unamortized investment tax credit liability.
Net Operating Loss Carryforwards
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy had $42.2 million and $132.4 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. At December 31, 2019, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro had $12.3 million and $56.2 million, respectively, of tax benefits related to federal NOL carryforwards. Approximately $7.1 million of Evergy's tax benefits at December 31, 2020 are related to NOLs that were acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition. Due to federal limitations on the utilization of income tax attributes acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition, Evergy expects a portion of these federal NOL carryforwards to expire unutilized and has provided a valuation allowance against $7.1 million of the federal income tax benefit. The federal NOL carryforwards expire in years 2023 to 2024.
The year of origin of Evergy's related tax benefit amounts for federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2020 are detailed in the following table.
In addition, Evergy also had deferred tax benefits of $8.8 million and $31.0 million related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Evergy Kansas Central had deferred tax benefits of $10.8 million related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2019. Evergy Metro had deferred tax benefits of $0.2 million and $5.7 million related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The state NOL carryforwards expire in years 2021 to 2038. Evergy does not expect to utilize $7.1 million of NOLs before the expiration date of the carryforwards of NOLs in certain states. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided against $7.1 million of state tax benefits.
Alternative Minimum Tax Carryforwards
At December 31, 2019, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central had $37.9 million and $13.4 million, respectively, of federal AMT carryforwards.
Valuation Allowances
Evergy is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets using a "more likely than not" assessment threshold. This assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within Evergy's control. As a result of this assessment, Evergy has established a partial valuation allowance for federal and state tax NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. During 2020, $3.1 million of tax benefit was recorded in continuing operations primarily related to utilization or expiration of certain state NOL carryforwards.
Kansas Tax Reform
In May 2020, the state of Kansas exempted certain public utilities, including Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, from Kansas corporate income tax beginning in 2021 and authorized the KCC to approve changes in rates related to increases or decreases in federal or state income tax rates.
As a result of the exemption from Kansas corporate income tax, the Evergy Companies revalued their deferred income tax assets and liabilities in May 2020. Evergy decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $233.8 million, primarily consisting of a $400.4 million adjustment for the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in rate base and a $31.7 million tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes and $13.8 million of income tax expense primarily related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be recovered from customers in future rates; partially offset by a decrease to unamortized investment tax credits of $183.6 million due to the revaluation of certain Kansas income tax credits and a $16.9 million tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes.
Evergy Kansas Central decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $17.6 million, primarily consisting of a $293.7 million adjustment for the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in rate base and a $17.3 million tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes; partially offset by a decrease to unamortized investment tax credits of $183.6 million due to the revaluation of certain Kansas income tax credits and a $16.9 million tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes and $109.0 million of income tax expense primarily related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be recovered from customers in future rates.
Evergy Metro decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $152.9 million, primarily consisting of a $106.7 million adjustment for the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in rate base and a $14.4
million tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes and $32.2 million of income tax benefit primarily related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be refunded to customers in future rates.
The changes to the Evergy Companies' net deferred income tax liabilities included in rate base were offset by corresponding changes in regulatory liabilities. The net regulatory liabilities will be refunded to customers in future rates by amortizing the amounts related to plant assets over the remaining useful life of the assets, and amortizing the amounts related to other items over a period to be determined in a future rate case. The changes to the Evergy Companies' unamortized investment tax credits were related to the portion of certain Kansas income tax credits that are not expected to be used after December 31, 2020. The amounts of income tax expense (benefit) recognized by the Evergy Companies related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be recovered from or refunded to customers in future rates primarily pertain to deferred tax adjustments related to the difference between Evergy's consolidated tax rate and the statutory tax rates used for setting rates at Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West as well as deferred income tax adjustments related to non-regulated operations.
Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro currently recover the cost of Kansas corporate income taxes in rates from their customers at the statutory rate of 7% that will be effective until 2021, when the income tax exemption established by the state of Kansas takes effect. In accordance with the provisions of the income tax exemption, Evergy Metro and Evergy Kansas Central filed a joint application with the KCC in July 2020 to reduce their retail rates to reflect their exemption from Kansas corporate income taxes. In the joint application, Evergy Metro requested to implement its rate reduction in one phase, effective January 1, 2021, and Evergy Kansas Central requested to implement its rate reduction in three phases, effective January 1 in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023. In November 2020, the KCC approved Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's joint application.
Missouri Tax Reform
On June 1, 2018, the Missouri governor signed Senate Bill (S.B.) 884 into law. Most notably, S.B. 884 reduces the corporate income tax rate from 6.25% to 4.0% beginning in 2020, provides for the mandatory use of the single sales factor formula and eliminates intercompany transactions between corporations that file a consolidated Missouri income tax return.
As a result of the change in the Missouri corporate income tax rate, Evergy Metro revalued and restated its deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of June 1, 2018. Evergy Metro decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $46.6 million, primarily consisting of a $28.8 million adjustment for the revaluation and restatement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in Missouri jurisdictional rate base and a $9.9 million tax gross-up adjustment for ratemaking purposes. The decrease to Evergy Metro's net deferred income tax liabilities included in Missouri jurisdictional rate base were offset by a corresponding increase in regulatory liabilities. The net regulatory liabilities will be amortized to customers over a period to be determined in a future rate case.
Evergy Metro recognized $15.5 million of income tax benefit in 2018 primarily related to the difference between Evergy Metro's revaluation of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount of the revaluation pertaining to Evergy Metro's Missouri jurisdictional rate base.
21. LEASES
The Evergy Companies lease office buildings, computer equipment, vehicles, rail cars, generating plant and other property and equipment, including rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for the other owners' proportionate share of the costs. Under GAAP, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Evergy Companies assess a contract as being or containing a lease if the contract identifies property, plant and equipment, provides the lessee the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the property, plant and equipment and provides the lessee the right to direct the use of the property, plant and equipment.
The Evergy Companies have entered into several agreements to purchase energy through renewable purchase power agreements that are accounted for as leases that commenced prior to the application of Topic 842. Due to the
intermittent nature of renewable generation, these leases have significant variable lease payments not included in the initial and subsequent measurement of the lease liability. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. In addition, certain other contracts contain payment for activity that transfers a separate good or service such as utilities or common area maintenance. The Evergy Companies have elected a practical expedient permitted by GAAP to not separate such components of the lease from other lease components for all leases.
The Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro leases have remaining terms ranging from 1 to 18 years, 1 to 18 years and 1 to 25 years, respectively. Leases that have original lease terms of twelve months or less are not recognized on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets. Some leases have options to renew the lease or terminate early at the election of the Evergy Companies. Judgment is applied at lease commencement to determine the reasonably certain lease term based on then-current assumptions about use of the leased asset, market conditions and terms in the contract. The judgment applied to determine the lease term can significantly impact the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and lease classification.
The Evergy Companies typically discount lease payments over the term of the lease using their incremental borrowing rates at lease commencement to measure its initial and subsequent lease liability. For leases that existed at the initial application of Topic 842, the Evergy Companies used the incremental borrowing rates that corresponded to the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019.
Leases may be classified as either operating leases or finance leases. The lease classification is based on assumptions of the lease term and discount rate, as discussed above, and the fair market value and economic life of the leased asset. Operating leases recognize a consistent expense each period over the lease term, while finance leases will result in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use asset. Finance leases are treated as operating leases for rate-making purposes and as such, the Evergy Companies defer to a regulatory asset or liability any material differences between expense recognition and the timing of payments in order to match what is being recovered in customer rates.
The Evergy Companies’ lease expense is detailed in the following table.
Supplemental cash flow information related to the Evergy Companies' leases is detailed in the following table.
Finance Leases
Right-of-use assets for finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets. Lease liabilities for finance leases are included in other current and other long-term liabilities. Payments and other supplemental information for finance leases as of December 31, 2020, are detailed in the following table.
Operating Leases
Right-of-use assets for operating leases are included in other long-term assets on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets. Lease liabilities for operating leases are included in other current and other long-term liabilities. Lease payments and other supplemental information for operating leases as of December 31, 2020, are detailed in the following table.
