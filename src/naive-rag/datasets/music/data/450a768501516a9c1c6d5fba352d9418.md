# PREFACE

This fourth edition of _Orchestral Music_ represents the conflation of my database with that of the Orchestra Library Information Service (OLIS). OLIS was created in the early 1980s, about the time of my second edition, by the American Symphony Orchestra League. Marshall Burlingame, now principal librarian of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, did the research work, devoting much of his winter season activity for three years to this important task. At first it was in an index card format, but it soon became computerized.

Alas, in the late 1990s, OLIS began to suffer from lack of maintenance and updating. At this point, Kazue McGregor, librarian of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, had the happy idea of combining OLIS and "Daniels" into one _ü_ ber-database that would capitalize on the best features of each. She lobbied most persuasively with me, with the American Symphony Orchestra League, and with Tom Gaitens of Fine Arts Management, which had been offering OLIS as part of its Orchestra Professional Administrative Systems (OPAS)—an extraordinary software program of great power.

It took far longer than we all had foreseen to bring this combination to pass. However, before the end of 2005, it will be available in three products:

  1. This book that you hold in your hand
  2. A searchable web application (OrchestralMusic.com) from Scarecrow Press with periodic updating
  3. An option within OPAS, available from Fine Arts Software (an off-shoot of Fine Arts Management)1

Users of the previous editions of _Orchestral Music_ will recognize new features inspired by OLIS. For the most part, these consist of enhanced detail regarding woodwind doublings, percussion equipment, and composers' dates and places of birth and death.

Of course, the most important musical compositions already existed in both databases—though sometimes with surprising discrepancies, each of which I had to research anew. Such new research should make the resulting database more accurate than either of its predecessors. On the other hand, the vast amount of new information greatly multiplies the possibility of error. I will be very grateful to learn of any needed corrections from users of this book, of OrchestralMusic.com, or of OPAS.

Quite aside from accuracy, I have tried to make each entry readily comprehensible to any informed user, without the need to refer to an elaborate table of abbreviations. The table is there, of course, on pp.xii-xiii, in case my choices are less obvious than I had hoped.

**Instrumentation formula.** The formulaic arrangement of wind instruments, familiar to all in the field, is used here: flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon — horn, trumpet, trombone, tuba. Amplifications, if any, are spelled out in brackets. A dot (.) separates one player from another; a slash (/) indicates doubling. Thus...

3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn]

...should be understood as:

Unfortunately, in the previous editions of _Orchestral Music_ , some 4500 works were listed using a cruder scheme involving the symbols *, + , and = . These showed that certain auxiliary woodwinds were present, but not how many of them, nor in which part. With many of these, OLIS provided the missing specifics; others I managed to track down. However, there is a certain residue for which I could not be certain of the details. For these I have had to resort to such devices as: 3[incl pic], meaning that one or more of the three flutists must play, or double on, piccolo.

In the notes to individual works, for "2fl" read "2 flutes." For "fI2," read "flute 2" (i.e. 2nd flute).

**Composers.** For composers' names and dates, my main source has been _Grove Music Online_ ,2 supplemented as needed. Because Russia did not adopt until 1918 the Gregorian calendar, standard in the West, Grove gives birth and/or death dates in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars for many late 19th- and early 20th-century Russian composers. In such cases it is the Julian date (about 10 days earlier than the Gregorian) that comes first.

You will find "see references" from divergent spellings of a composer's surname.

**Titles.** For _generic titles_ (Symphony, Concerto, etc.) I have adopted the uniform title system of American libraries. Recognizing that this book is being used all over the world, I have generally rendered _distinctive titles_ (i.e., nongeneric) in their original form, if it is in one of the languages with which most musicians have a passing acquaintance (English, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Latin). Titles in other languages are generally given first in English, with the original following in parentheses, transliterated if necessary; however, this principle is not followed strictly, if common sense dictates otherwise (e.g., Stravinsky's _Les noces_ ).

If you have trouble finding a title you think should be here, try the title index in the back of the book. All distinctive titles, title translations, and nicknames should be listed there, with directions to the composer and whatever form of the title I have chosen. International users who may not be sure of the common English version of, for example, _Vesna svyashchennaya_ or _Sacre du printemps_ , may look for either one in the title index, which will refer them to Stravinsky's _Rite of Spring_. The title index is also useful should you momentarily forget who composed, say, _La bayadére_.

**Alphabetization.** Intial articles in all languages are ignored for purposes of alphabetization. This leads to a few seeming oddities, such as Mozart's _Eine kleine Nachtmusik_ alphabetized under "K" rather than "E."

**Durations.** Durations will, of course, vary from one performance to the next, even under the same conductor. The durations in this book should be considered reasonable approximations only. Quite aside from tempo variances, some conductors consider repeats to be optional, which will cause further divergence. The website allmusic.com, described in Appendix I, "Resources," may be useful in sampling the duration spread.

**Publishers.** Sources of scores and parts appear in short form across the bottom of each entry in italics. Consult the directory of publishers and sources in the back of the book for further contact information. I give websites for publishers where possible; some of these are excellent sources of information. Others, alas, are impenetrable but will doubtless improve as we all become more Web-savvy.

**Historical practices.** In using this book, it helps to have some knowledge of certain orchestral practices of earlier periods.

**FLUTES AND RECORDERS**. When a baroque composer used the term _flauto_ unmodified, or perhaps _flauto dolce_ , he meant recorder. If he wanted a transverse flute, he took pains to call it _traversa_ or _flauto traverso_ or some such term.

**WOODWIND DOUBLING**. As late as the time of Mozart, players were likely to alternate on several instruments. This explains why an eighteenth-century work otherwise for 2 oboes, 2 horns, and strings suddenly uses 2 flutes and strings for a middle movement. The oboists simply switched to flute. Nowadays, of course, that is largely impractical.

**BASSOONS**. In eighteenth-century practice, a bassoon played the bass line of an orchestral work, whether specified in the score or not. The bassoon may have been optional in works for string orchestra, but if other winds were used, the bassoon was _de rigueur_. In such cases, some editions list the bassoon and some do not. I have merely followed the edition in hand, but conductors may wish to employ the bassoon, perhaps playing from a cello or bass part, whether or not it is called for.

Nineteenth-century French orchestras normally had 4 bassoons doubling two real parts. Occasionally they might split into four parts for a few bars. I have attempted to distinguish between the number of bassoons called for and the number of real parts involved, if different.

**SARRUSOPHONE, SERPENT, & OPHICLEIDE**. These three instruments were prominent in the nineteenth-century quest for a suitable bass instrument for woodwind and brass choirs. The sarrusophone was a keyed brass instrument in various sizes played with a double reed. Its contrabass form competed with, and was eventually superceded by, the contrabassoon. Serpent and ophicleide were cup-mouthpiece keyed instruments ultimately replaced by the tuba. Curious combinations are encountered, such as Mendelssohn's indication (Symphony No.5, last movement) _Contrafagotto e Serpente_ on the same part. That would seem to suggest a contrabassoon and tuba, as a modern equivalent, playing in unison—though in practical modern terms, the part is usually covered by contrabassoon alone.

**TROMBONES**. In eighteenth-century choral music, it was customary for trombones to double the altos, tenors, and basses of the chorus, and sometimes for a _cornetto_ (also known as _zink_ , a relative of the serpent) to double the sopranos. These instruments were often not mentioned in the score at all. You may add them when they are not indicated or omit them when they are—since in any case, a modern chorus with large-bore trombones is not going to sound much like an eighteenth-century chorus (using boy sopranos and male altos) with the sackbut-like trombones of the period.

**BASS DRUM & CYMBALS**. In nineteenth-century bass drum parts, especially Italian opera, cymbals were expected to be played with the bass drum, even though they were not specifically notated in the part. Probably the cymbals weren't added indiscriminately to every single note, but were applied with a certain amount of taste and discretion—a vague and not terribly helpful recipe.

A related question is whether two players are required in these cases, or whether mounting one cymbal on the bass drum and clashing it with the other is acceptable. Some say that attaching one cymbal spoils its tone; others that having a single musician play both instruments has compensating virtues. I have switched from the former to the latter position, after hearing Jeffrey Fischer, a Boston percussionist, play with exquisite delicacy the two instruments at once.

For the purposes of the percussion count in this book, I have indicated two players in all these situations—even in cases where I was pretty sure the composer had in mind one player and I as a conductor would prefer only one.

**TENOR DRUM & FIELD DRUM**. In American practice, it seems clear that of these two deeper drums, the field drum has snares and the tenor drum does not. Other nations have other traditions, and especially with such terms as _tamburo rullante, caisse roulante_ , or _Rührtrommel_ , it is not always entirely clear in a particular composition which instrument is intended. Sometimes the composer helps by specifying: _caisse roulante avec cordes_ , for example.

**Acknowledgments.** Many friends, colleagues, and perfect strangers from around the globe have helped with this work. I can only name a few, but I thank them all.

**Clinton F. Nieweg,** former principal librarian of the Philadelphia Orchestra is as renowned for his dogged pursuit of accuracy as for his generous mentorship of young orchestra librarians. He has over the years been in touch with me, loaning scores, sending corrections, suggesting additions, and giving encouragement.

Now he has outdone himself. He volunteered to go over this entire book and has spent months doing exactly that—right up until the last hours before I had to send it to the publisher. His vast store of knowledge and experience, expressed in thousands of e-mail exchanges, has put his stamp upon this book. Without him it would not be the same.

**David Rahbee,** a freelance conductor now working out of Vienna, has for years been sending me information for this book: movement durations, lists of contents, backgrounds on various pieces, and welcome suggestions for additions of lesser-known works.

**Tom Gaitens,** head of Fine Arts Software and OPAS guru, has been marvelously helpful and encouraging throughout. He has been totally flexible in making sure that OPAS will be able to accommodate my database.

**Russ Girsberger,** performance librarian for the New England Conservatory in Boston, is author of the percussion book I always turn to first: _A Practical Guide to Percussion Terminology_. I have consulted him frequently on arcane matters of percussion terminology, equipment, and practice.

**Helen Rowin,** music librarian (retired), Detroit Public Library, for the third time prepared the list of Jewish composers in Appendix H, a daunting task that she tackled with a sense of relish and adventure.

**Edward Kurdyla,** vice president and publisher of Scarecrow Press, has been a model of patience, as I missed one deadline after another.

**Kile Smith,** curator of the Fleisher Collection in Philadelphia is always ready to search his stacks and files to solve a particularly irksome question. Also **Leah Kirchner, Linda Black,** and the staff of the Rochester Hills Public Library have been resourceful in securing numerous inter-library loans of scores so that I could check some tiny detail.

Finally, thanks to my wife, **Jimmie Sue Daniels,** who had threatened divorce every previous time I started a new edition of this book. This time she gracefully acquiesced, right from the outset. It was she, along with my daughter **Abigail Daniels,** who proofread all the previous editions.

## APPENDIX D  
ORCHESTRAL WORKS LISTED BY INSTRUMENTATION

This appendix is good for browsing. If you are looking for works that employ certain combinations of instruments—or perhaps works that do not exceed certain limits of instrumentation—this is the place. It includes orchestral works only—not accompaniments for solos or choral music.

Use the following chart. It progresses more or less from smaller to larger combinations. Find the category that best fits your needs. The right-most column will then send you to the appropriate pages.

Once there, the lists of pieces are in a sort of rough chronological order according to the composers' dates of birth. The idea is that you can go to the part of each list that interests you: near the beginning of any list for baroque music, near the end for contemporary music, and so on.

If a category is more than 15 or so pieces, it is subdivided by duration: 0'-10', 11'-20', and so on.

Once you get used to navigating this appendix, it should be easy to find a handful of works according to your specifications: short baroque pieces for strings and continuo, for example; or 19th-century works using double woodwinds, modest brass, and lasting less than 20 minutes.

The categories in the chart, of course, are far from exact. Many of the pieces call for somewhat fewer instruments than the category suggests. It will be necessary to turn to the main alphabetical listing by composer to establish the precise details for any work in which you are interested.

## APPENDIX E  
**ORCHESTRAL WORKS LISTED BY DURATION**

This appendix is intended for browsers who are looking for a particular sort of piece to fill out a program—a French baroque work, let us say, of about eight minutes in duration. Here is how it works:

Orchestral pieces (not accompaniments) are grouped by duration. Within each group, they are subdivided according to the composer's nationality; and within each subdivision, they are listed chronologically by composer's birthdate. Thus the French baroque piece mentioned above would appear in the 6′-10′ group, the French & Belgian subdivision, near the beginning of the list: Lully, Lalande, Couperin, Rameau and LeClair are possibilities.

The composer's nationality is normally taken to be the country of origin, though there are exceptions (Lully, though Italian by birth, is inextricably bound with the history of French music). See also Appendix H, in which composers are listed under more than one nationality where appropriate.

For complete information on any work, refer to the main alphabetical listing by composer.

## APPENDIX F  
WORKS INTENDED FOR YOUTH CONCERTS

In the vast repertoire for orchestra, there is no dearth of music that is suitable and appropriate for youth concerts. Almost any composition or excerpt can be made to work, if put in the right context.

This appendix, however, is concerned with works intended _primarily_ for young audiences. These tend to be works using narrations and composed after 1925 or so. The conspicuous exception is Saint-Saëns' well-loved _Carnival of the Animals_ , which was intended neither for children nor spoken commentary, but rather for family entertainment. It is included here because, with the addition of humorous narrative—usually verse—it has often come to be used to entertain youngsters.

The works listed here are divided into several categories:

  1. Stories Told with Music
  2. Descriptive Music
  3. Introduction to the Orchestra and/or its Instruments
  4. Explanations of Various Aspects of Music
  5. Other—that is, music for youth that does not fall into one of the previous categories.

A. Stories Told with Music

B. Descriptive Music

C. Introduction to the Orchestra and/or its lnstruments

D. Explanations of Various Aspects of Music

E. Other

## APPENDIX G

## APPENDIX H  
COMPOSER GROUPS FOR THEMATIC PROGRAMMING

Occasionally it is necessary to create programs of music by particular groups of composers, such as Polish composers, black composers, women composers. This appendix is intended to help in that process.

Obviously, many composers belong to more than one of these groups. Meyerbeer, for example, was Jewish, born in Germany, and did much of his important work in France. Tania León is black, female, born in Cuba, and has lived in the United States for many years.

The list of Jewish composers was researched by Helen Rowin, music librarian, Detroit Public Library (retired).

## APPENDIX I  
RESOURCES

The rise of the Internet has changed many of the ways conductors, orchestra librarians, personnel managers and other staff go about their business. Nevertheless, some of the old ways still persist, including principally the irreplaceable one of carefully examining the score you are about to program, order, rehearse or perform.

This appendix includes the resources that I personally find most useful, and which others may not know about. It is divided into three sections:

  1. Books
  2. Institutions and Organizations
  3. Online

* * *

A. BOOKS

General

**Jerzy Chwialkowski,** **The Da Capo Catalog of Classical Music Compositions.** [Cambridge, MA]: Da Capo Press, 1996.

A ponderous paperback, listing the complete works of 132 major composers, from Monteverdi to Stockhausen. Useful in surprising and unpredictable ways. Includes thematic index numbers not just for Mozart and Bach, but for composers you never thought had them (Albeniz, W.F. Bach, and Martinu, for example). Includes lists of opera excerpts: Do you need to check the name of an aria from Rossini's _Elisabetta_ , Act II? More than a dozen of them are there, on page 1040, in the order in which they occur in the opera, though, alas, without identification as to which character sings them.

**Theodor Müller-Reuter,** **Lexikon der deutschen Konzertliteratur: ein Ratgeber für Dirigenten, Konzertveranstalter, Musikschriftsteller und Musikfreunde.** 2 vols. Leipzig: G. F. Kahnt, 1909-1921. (Reprint Da Capo Press, 1972)

Very old, but very great. Gives full and detailed information on individual works, including instrumentation, duration, movement titles, and rich background information. An oddly idiosyncratic selection of 15 composers. Although the title proclaims it a lexicon of _German_ concert literature, it includes Berlioz and Liszt amongst the Germans and Austrians—but Beethoven, Brahms and Haydn were not included until the 1921 supplement, and Mozart never made it at all! It does include some now-obscure composers (Draeseke and Gernsheim), and others presently enjoying a revival of interest (Raff, Reinecke).

**Wilhelm Buschkötter & Hansjürgen Schaefer,** **Handbuch der internationalen Konzertliteratur (Manual of International Concert Literature)** 2nd ed., revised and expanded. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1996.

Analogous to the present book. In German, and reflective of German repertoire. A vast improvement over the first edition (1961).

**Jennifer Goodenberger** , **Subject Guide to Classical Instrumental Music**. Lanham, MD & London: Scarecrow Press, 2001 (paperback reprint of original 1989 edition).

Originally intended for individuals working in film, television, radio and education, but useful to musicians as well. Lists of instrumental compositions (not just orchestral) organized by subject matter or topic, such as _Arabia, Autumn, Bears, Bells_ and the like. May be helpful in planning thematic programs.

Choral

**Translations and Annotations of Choral Repertoire. Volume I: Sacred Latin Texts** (compiled and annotated by Ron Jeffers), **Volume II: German Texts** (compiled and annotated by Ron Jeffers and Gordon Paine). Corvallis, OR: Earthsongs, 1988-

Mass, Requiem, Te Deum, Magnificat, cantatas, motets, partsongs, hymns and the like; translations given word-by-word (so you know exactly what each word means) as well as line-by-line (to give the overall sense). Excellent background information on each text and its source. Further works in this series may appear.

**Jonathan Green,** **A Conductor's Guide to Choral-Orchestral Works**. Lanham, MD & London: Scarecrow Press, 1994-

An ongoing series, of which four volumes have appeared: 20th-century works with English texts (1994); Rachmaninov through Penderecki (1998); J.S. Bach (2000); and Haydn and Mozart (2001). Rich detail on each work, including background, performing forces, duration, contents and performance issues.

Percussion

Several recent books now fill what had previously been a complete vacuum: the problem of organizing the percussion section and assigning parts. These publications complement each other nicely. Listed in order of overall utility.

**Henk de Vlieger,** **Handbook for the Orchestral Percussion Section.** The Hague, Netherlands: Albersen, 2003.

The most extensive of this crop of books: 2,000 titles by 111 composers. Lists how many timpanists, how many percussionists, and what percussion instruments are needed for each composition, as well as a possible distribution of parts and instruments among the percussionists. Includes a brief five-step tutorial entitled "How to create a distribution," as well as a glossary of percussion terms which, however, will not replace the need for a good dictionary of percussion terminology, such as that of Russ Girsberger.

**Bo Holmstrand,** **Percussion Instrumentation Guide for Symphony Orchestras** , ed. Jari Eskola. Gothenburg & Helsinki: Edition Escobar, 2004.

Jocularly referred to as "BoHo," this book treats 1,500 titles by 360 composers in a manner similar to de Vlieger (above). The current printing is charmingly distinguished by the fact that the Swedish language does not differentiate between the letters "V" and "W." Thus the alphabetization of W- and V-composers runs: Wagner, Walton, Varese, Vaughan Williams, Weber, Weinberger, Verdi and so on. It's easy, once you get used to it.

**Maggie Cotton,** **Percussion Work Book**. Birmingham, UK: Maggie Cotton, 1993; subsequent revised printings.

1,000 titles by 192 composers. The main body of the book is similar to de Vlieger and BoHo. Special sections deal with: (1) large setups, and (2) timpani requirements (tunings and number of kettles) for works with no other percussion.

**Horst Huber,** **Pauke und Schlagzeug in den Werken von Haydn bis Messiaen (Timpani and Percussion in the Works from Haydn to Messiaen)**. Introductory essay [in German and English] by Michael Bastian Weiss. Munich: Horst Huber, 2003. Companion volume: **Timpany** [sic] **and Percussion in the Works of Giuseppe Verdi**. Munich: Books on Demand, 2003.

800 works by 26 composers—plus, in the companion volume, all the Verdi operas. More discursive and scholarly than the previous books. In addition to the usual percussion distributions, each composer is provided with a chart, summarizing by instrument the works in which the composer used that instrument. Appendices include:

(1) lists by composer of the appearance of extraordinary instruments

(2) lists of the earliest historical appearance of certain instruments and/or effects

(3) polyglot glossaries of percussion instruments (German-English, English-German; German-Italian, Italian-German; German-French, French-German).

Pronunciation

**Robert A. Fradkin,** **The Well-Tempered Announcer; A Pronunciation Guide to Classical Music**. Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1996.

Intended for radio announcers at classical stations, but useful to all of us who are required by our jobs to mangle names and titles in a variety of languages.

Opera

**Quaintance Eaton,** **Opera Production; A Handbook**. 2 vol. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, v.1, 1961 [reprinted 1974 by Da Capo Press.]; v.2, 1974.

Everything you need to know about an opera short of learning the score. Vital statistics, brief sketches of the plot, major roles with voice-type and range meticulously specified, lesser roles, chorus, orchestration and availability of reductions. Everything, that is, as it was in 1961 and 1974.

**Nicholas Ivor Martin,** **The Da Capo Opera Manual**. New York: Da Capo Press, 1997.

Similar to Eaton (above), though with much less information about necessary voice-types, ranges, and special abilities for major roles. No listings of orchestra reductions. On the plus side, major arias are itemized for each work, and a useful appendix lists arias by voice-type and title.

**W. Franklin Summers,** **Operas in One Act; A Production Guide**. Lanham, MD & London: Scarecrow Press, 1997.

Similar to Eaton (above), but limited to one-act operas. 275 operas: 245 with English as the original language; 30 with singable English translations of foreign-language libretti.

**Nico Castel,** **Operatic Libretti Series**. Mt. Morris, NY: Leyerle Publications, 197?-.

A monumental series of opera librettos, in a 3-line format: the original opera text in boldface, a phonetic version directly above (in the International Phonetic Alphabet), and a word-for-word English translation directly below. Where needed, a fourth (lowest) line gives an idiomatic English version. 17 volumes (each volume containing several operas) are currently available in the series, including 2 volumes of Puccini, 4 of Verdi, 2 of Mozart and so on.

Originally the library of the Symphony Club, a youth training orchestra founded and financed by Edwin A. Fleisher. In 1929, it was given to the Free Library of Philadelphia, where it has grown (with a boost from depression-era WPA copyists) into the largest lending library of orchestral scores and parts on the planet. Many rare and hard-to-find compositions are part of the Collection.

A fee is charged for the loan of public domain works. Copyright-protected works may also be borrowed if clearance is obtained from the copyright holder; the staff of the Collection will help you figure out who that copyright-holder might be. Conductors may borrow examination scores, and the staff always seems energized by particularly challenging reference questions.

National Anthem Protocols |   
---|---  
U.S. Army Band, Fort Myer, VA | Tel: 703-696-3648

The United States government has assigned the responsibility for keeping track of correct, current national anthems for all nations to the U.S. Army Band at Fort Myer, Virginia. Band arrangements, which can easily be adapted for orchestral use, may usually be obtained from this source. Governments of other nations are likely to maintain similar arrangements through either their military or foreign affairs departments.

National anthem sites are available on the internet, such as www.national-anthems.net, but there is no guarantee that their information is either current or correct. Rather than risk embarrassment—or even an international incident—one might prefer to consult an official source.

Protocol dictates that on U.S. soil, the U.S. national anthem shall be played last. If there are more than one preceding foreign anthems, they should be played in alphabetical order. If on foreign soil, the anthem of the home country should be played last.

South Glamorgan, UK | pocket.pub@ntlworld.com  
CF64 3DA | www.pocket-publications.com

A specialist publisher of orchestral reductions of opera scores, under the direction of Tony Burke, formerly librarian of the Welsh National Opera Orchestra. Reductions are for rent (or "hire" as they say in England). There are two categories of reductions: (1) an orchestra of about 18 players or more, and (2) a chamber version, in which the opera has been completely rescored for 5 players or more. (Can you believe the Ring of the Nibelung for 12 musicians?) Often there are several different reductions of the same opera. Excerpts are available to order, for all operas in the catalog. The company also rents full orchestrations.

Verein für Musikalische Privataufführungen  
(Society for Private Musical Performances)

In 1918 in Vienna, Arnold Schoenberg and his circle of modernists formed this Society for the purpose of promoting contemporary music. Initially performances were open only to members of the Society, though later public performances were given. The Society disbanded in 1921.

Many compositions were arranged by members of the Society for a core ensemble of flute, clarinet, horn, harmonium, piano and string quintet—with occasionally a few added instruments or a solo voice. Arrangements were by Schoenberg himself, his son-in-law Felix Greissle, Alban Berg and Erwin Stein, among others; composers whose works were selected for this purpose included Bruckner, Busoni, Debussy, Mahler, Reger, Schoenberg, Schubert, Johann Strauss Jr., Webern and Zemlinsky.

Many of these arrangements are now commercially available. A good source of information is the Belmont website, <www.geocities.com/belmontmusic90272/belmont/verein.htm>, which also has a direct link to the relevant portion of the Arnold Schönberg Center website: <www.schoenberg.at/6_archiv/music/works/verein_arrangements_e.htm>.

**Histoire du soldat** **instrumentations** |

CutTime Players | Tel & Fax: 313-886-0894  
PO Box 36120 | cuttime@ic.net  
Detroit, MI 48236 | www.cuttime.com

The instrumentation of Stravinsky's _Histoire du soldat_ (clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, trombone, violin, double bass and percussion) has become an occasional model for other composers, such as Michael Daugherty ( _Dead Elvis_ ) and Virgil Thomson ( _Parson Weems and the Cherry Tree_ , which adds a flute, and dispenses with bassoon). The CutTime Players, a group of Detroit Symphony musicians led by bassist Rick Robinson, has taken this seven-member instrumentation plus flute as their core ensemble and produced over six dozen transcriptions of famous symphonic, piano and jazz-related works for their own use, including such astonishingly ambitious works as _Till Eulenspiegel, Peter and the Wolf, Rumanian Rhapsody No. 1, Pictures at an Exhibition_ and the _1st Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio_ by Claude Boiling. Many of these are available for sale.

* * *

C. ONLINE

Almost everything these days—publishers, organizations, businesses—has a website. The list that follows, however, consists of useful websites and listserves at least some of which have no independent existence in the "real" world.

AMG allmusic | www.allmusic.com  
---|---

A very slow and irritating site, but its virtues make it worth knowing about. It is excellent for finding durations of complete works and individual movements, checking titles of movements and perusing the surprisingly excellent program notes.

In the "Search" space, enter a composer's last name. In the "Name" pull-down, select "Classical Work"; it is important to do this, or you will get a hodge-podge of popular music. Then click "Go." (Ignore "Advanced Search," which tends to place you in an endless loop.)

After a brief wait you will see a long list of the chosen composer's works, some of the titles in boldface type—others not. The significance of the bold titles is not clear, since the non-bold entries often (though not always) have just as much information. Annoyingly, the list is not in any logical order whatsoever, so you may have to scroll up and down and read every title to find the work you want.

Click on the desired work. The next screen will show several CDs that contain the work, as well as the first half-dozen lines of the program notes. Titles of movements may be found by clicking the tab "Parts/Movements." For durations of individual movements, it will be necessary to click on one of the CDs; you may have to go through several CDs to find one that actually has this information, using your browser to work your way backwards through the various stages with exasperating torpidity.

Oh—and don't fail to play with the delightful whirligig at the top ("Instrument, Mood, Theme," etc.).

Gaylord Music Library Necrology | <http://library.wustl.edu/units/music/necro>  
---|---

Founded by the late Nathan Eakin, at Washington University in St. Louis. This is one of the best of the various online music necrologies.

Music-In-Print | www.emusicquest.com  
---|---

Successor to the Music-In-Print series of Musicdata, Inc., which began in 1973. Donald Reese started emusicquest in 2000 to provide an Internet-based searchable sheet music index for piano, band and popular guitar—areas not covered by Music-In-Print. He later acquired the assets of Musicdata, Inc., and expanded his index to include 15 specific music areas, the most relevant for this book being "Orchestral."

Access to the site is available via annual subscription. Pricing information may be found on the site. Trial subscriptions are available.

Searches in the Orchestral area of the emusicquest site will yield publication information, instrumentation and duration. There is a very complete publisher directory. The databases are frequently updated, and Mr. Reese is eager to make corrections as needed.

Orchestralist | <http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/orchestralist>  
---|---

An international listserve for the orchestra business, created by conductor/composer Andrew Levine. Regular participants include many conductors, composers, players, publishers and the like. Quick questions usually receive prompt answers. Very long threads tend to develop on certain subjects. No-cost subscriptions may be set to receive either a daily digest or individual messages as they are posted. Archives may be searched.

Orchestra Library Information Yahoo! Group | OrchLibInfo@yahoogroups.com  
---|---  
| http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/OrchLibInfo

This group serves primarily as a way to pick the brains of Clinton F. Nieweg, principal librarian, Philadelphia Orchestra (ret.) who has been a pedagogue and mentor to students of orchestral librarianship for many years, and whose fingerprints are all over this book as well. The listserve owner is Thomas Pease. It is possible to peruse past messages, post new messages and subscribe for either the daily digest or individual e-mails.

Symphony Orchestra Library Center | www.orchestralibrary.com  
---|---

This one should be called "The Mother of All Websites," at least for orchestral information. Created and maintained by Steven Sherrill of the Atlanta Symphony Library. The home page consists almost entirely of links—several hundred of them—invitingly arranged for browsing or for searching. You'll find just about anything here, including transposed parts for those nasty bass clarinets in A or in bass clef, and D clarinets transposed for E-flat.

Gigfix.com | admin@gigfix.com  
---|---

An intriguing website apparently designed for freelance musicians in the UK. There are many links useful for musicians all over the world, however. One of the best is a searchable repertoire database where, for example, flutists can check to see whether they should bring their piccolos.

Grove Music Online | www.grovemusic.com  
---|---

All musicians know _The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians_ (2nd edition, 2000, ed. Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell) as a peerless English-language reference source. _Grove Music Online_ takes it to a still higher level. It includes the full text of all 29 volumes, plus the 4 volumes of _The New Grove Dictionary of Opera_ and the 3 volumes of _The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz_ —and it is updated annually.

This amazing resource is available by subscription; free trials may be arranged.

Orchestral Music | www.orchestralmusic.com  
---|---

Still under development: the online version of the present book. This will be available by subscription from Scarecrow Press. Advantages will be flexible searching, interactive elements and semiannual updates and corrections.

## APPENDIX J  
TITLE INDEX

Distinctive titles of compositions, as well as subtitles, nicknames, title translations and distinctive titles of excerpts, are followed by the composer and title of the work as it appears in the main list.

Generic titles (symphony, suite) are not listed unless they are modified so as to become distinctive titles themselves (e.g., _Symphony of Psalms, Suite provençale_ ).

## APPENDIX K  
PUBLISHERS & SOURCES

The whole issue of publishers and sources of orchestral music is bewilderingly complex. The lists that follow will probably be out of date before the ink is dry on their pages. In preparing these listings, I would frequently update an entry, only to have to do it all over again a few weeks later.

However, once one knows a little of the history of various publishers, the whole problem sheds a bit of its mystery. Accordingly, I have appended a few lines of background to some of the entries. My information largely came from four sources: (1) Grove Music Online, (2) the websites of the publishers themselves, (3) the Music-In-Print website (www.emusicquest.com) and (4) Clinton Nieweg, former principal librarian of the Philadelphia Orchestra, who has a vast store of knowledge and experience in this sphere, as well as many contacts in the music publishing industry.

The organization of individual entries should be self-evident; it is probably not necessary to point out, in this day and age, that lines with "@" in them are e-mail addresses, whereas lines beginning with "www" or "http://" are websites.

I have left generous margins for users to make note of changes, corrections and special contacts as desired. As always, I appreciate being informed of any inaccuracies.

# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

This was supposed to be a little summer project back in 1968—a modest handbook of orchestral repertoire. In the intervening 37 years, it has insidiously taken over David Daniels' life.

In between times, however, he taught at Oakland University in Michigan for 28 years and directed several orchestras. He is still music director of the Warren Symphony, also in Michigan, and has guest conducted in Detroit, Boston, Illinois, Michigan, South Carolina, and Venezuela.

He received an A.B. degree from Oberlin College, an M.A. in musicology from Boston University, and both an M.F.A. in organ and a Ph.D. in orchestral literature and conducting from the University of lowa.
