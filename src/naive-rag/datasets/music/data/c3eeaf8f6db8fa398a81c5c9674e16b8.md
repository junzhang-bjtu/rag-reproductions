**INTRODUCTION**

**"Silver Wings"**

Kansas City, Missouri, September 14, 2001

On the Friday after terrorist attacks murdered thousands, crashed four airliners, and reduced New York's Twin Towers to rubble, Merle Haggard played a concert in Kansas City, Missouri. The instant he took the stage, he was pelted with requests—demands, really—that quickly coalesced into an impatient chant.

Fight! N! Side!

Fight! N! Side!

Fight! N! Side!

It went on and on like that, the fans yelling at the singer, for what seemed like forever. For his part, Merle had the look of a man who knew full well what it was going to be like this night but who was irritated and disappointed just the same when he found out he was right again. He sighed.

For just a second there, the Hag appeared not like a star at all, but like the old man he was, vulnerable and a little frail: At sixty-four, he was only half a decade or so beyond having had his arteries scraped clean by angioplasty. He looked small, too: Merle stands five feet seven but needs cowboy boots to do it. Most of all, he looked world-weary and a little put out by all these people screaming at him, as if they really imagined they could order him around. Hadn't they been paying attention to the words they'd been singing along with all these years? Not even his own mama had been able to tell Merle Haggard what to do.

Haggard shook his head slowly from side to side. And like so much else in his career, the gesture might have been interpreted in a number of ways. Was he telling the audience that he planned to play what he damned well pleased, no matter how aggressive their requests? Was he expressing disbelief at the audience's enthusiasm for him, or disgust at his fans' insistence upon a fightin' side he seemed, just then, unable or unwilling to muster? Was he merely shaking loose the cobwebs of one more day spent staring out the window of his tour bus? Or was he maybe wishing he'd never stepped off it, longing instead to be back on board a Silver Eagle that was so small and known and comfortable that it felt like home sweet home but that felt like a prison cell, as well, and for the same reason?

Merle didn't speak. He just leaned into the mike and started to sing:

_Silver wings, shining in the sunlight_

_Roaring engines, headed somewhere in flight_

_They're taking you away and leaving me lonely_

_Silver wings, slowly fading out of sight_

It was a song he'd written a very long time ago, back in the late Sixties when it seemed every song Merle Haggard wrote became an instant country classic—and this in an era when country records routinely shimmered with pop appeal and when not a few pop hits exploited a twang and fresh-air charm swiped from their country cousins. The song was "Silver Wings," and in 1969 it had played B-side to his "Workin' Man Blues" single, the hit that had provided him with something of a nom de plume in those final moments before another hit, "Okie from Muskogee," became his new signature song and new identity. "Okie from Muskogee," and its follow-up release, "The Fightin' Side of Me," had freed Haggard forever from mere country stardom, while also chaining him tightly to an image he'd been fighting to live down ever since. Except, that is, whenever he made it a point to live up to it, in the process foiling yet again the expectations of anyone who'd have preferred he live it down. The only person who gets to be the boss of Merle Haggard is Merle Haggard.

Haggard didn't leave the stage that night without performing "The Fightin' Side of Me," of course. But he did it only when he was ready and in the manner he wanted. This show's version of "Fightin' Side" didn't threaten a "boot in yer ass," in the "justout-lookin'-for-a-fight" style of "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)," the still-to-come Toby Keith hit that would soon serve as a "Fightin' Side" for a new century. Merle's "Fightin' Side," this night, was much more in the way of a heavy sigh, and a rolling up of the sleeves in order to tackle dirty but necessary work. And members of that evening's audience (though not without a few to-be-expected exceptions) sang along in the same sober fashion Merle went out of his way to model. "We've been getting a lot of requests for this one this week," he introduced the song. "We hadn't had to play it for a very long time." Another heavy sigh, and then: "Fortunately."

"This country doesn't need to be incited with 'Fightin' Side of Me,'" he explained to me a few weeks later when I asked him about what I'd seen. "It needs to know that we're together, but it sure doesn't need to be incited."

On record all those years ago, Merle had sung the haunted lines of "Silver Wings" with an aching lilt, and had been backed by a doom-saying piano figure that sounded anguished and felt hopeless. Even so, thanks to the song's relaxed melody and the record's shimmering string arrangement, Merle had created a "Silver Wings" back then that felt openhearted and generous. That "Silver Wings" offered heartache at its just-loveliest. Tonight, though, Merle's pretty images—metal wings shining in sunlight all too reminiscent of Tuesday's impossibly bright and blue sky—sounded hideous. He sang the familiar words in a voice choked and dazed, like he might be about to throw up. The boisterous crowd, which had been spoiling for a fight only a moment before, was shamed silent and turned reverent in a breath. All that rage was pushed aside to reveal the tears and still-bleeding wound beneath.

He closed his show that night, as he so often has, with "Okie from Muskogee." The crowd sang along with every word but sounded especially fierce and determined on the line "We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse" and on that word "proud."

"I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee."

Since he first sang those words, in 1969, Merle Haggard has enjoyed artistic and professional triumphs few can match. He's charted more than one hundred country hits, including thirty-eight chart-toppers and seventy-one top tens. He's acted in films and on television, entertained presidents and soberly appraised his nation from the cover of _Time_. He's released dozens of studio albums and another half dozen or more live ones, performed upwards of ten thousand concerts, been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and seen his songs performed by everyone from Dean Martin to Lynyrd Skynyrd to Elvis Costello, from Tammy Wynette and Willie Nelson to the Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan. In 2011 he was even feted, alongside Paul McCartney and Oprah Winfrey, as a Kennedy Center honoree. So you can't blame the man for taking a lot of pride in what he's accomplished. As he crowed in one song from the heady years just after "Okie from Muskogee" sent him down the road to becoming not only a star but an icon and even, momentarily, an American idol: "Lawd! Lawd! I've done it all!"

But so what? More than three decades on, Merle Haggard is best known, still, for one phrase, for one musically irresistible hook (love it or leave it, but try not to sing along!), for one politically charged, era-defining, and, as it's played out, era-transcending declaration. He's written hundreds of other songs, and dozens of those stone country classics, but today, when people beyond his core audience recognize the name Merle Haggard at all, it's overwhelmingly for that one damned song. The Hag's done it all, but he's famous ("infamous," some would charge) for a single ideologically loaded shotgun blast of what, from here in the twenty-first century, we can recognize as an early heartland rehearsal of identity politics, one early return of fire in what we now term the Culture War: "I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee."

In its first draft, the Culture War was called the Generation Gap, and that's where I come in. I bought my very first 45 rpm record, "War" by Edwin Starr, in the summer of 1970, but the truth is I settled for "War" only because the store was out of my first choice, "The Fightin' Side of Me" by Merle Haggard. I was just nine, so if I sensed any political tension between my favorites it was inchoate: I wanted both records because I thought both records sounded cool. I still do. The political contradictions became apparent to me soon enough, though. I grew up in an always hard-toiling blue-collar household, the rock 'n' soul son of a country-music-favoring father, himself a union man who worked his ass off every day for a plumbing and heating company, and my dad's kitchen table talk—about the hippies, "the blacks," the Vietnam War, welfare, and, always, the struggle to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table—was echoed in any number of Merle Haggard lyrics. I've been thinking about the ideas Haggard sings about ever since, seconding an argument here and rejecting others there but singing along with his indelible melodies either way. I'm not alone: As much as any American musical artist, and certainly as much as any country artist, Haggard, in his music, has intersected with the great issues of his times—those surrounding class and race, war and peace, and, most of all, freedom.

This book is the attempt of this critic and more or less lifelong Merle Haggard fan at writing a monograph on the man's music—on the songs he's written and, a key but too-often-elided distinction, the records he's made. What it's not is a biography of the man's life. Haggard deserves a doorstop along the lines of what RJ Smith has written recently for James Brown or what Gary Giddens is doing for Bing Crosby (to choose artists I hear as of comparable significance to Haggard), but that tome will have to wait. Of course, the basic plot points of Haggard's life get covered here. I've been fortunate to interview Haggard a few times over the years, and will quote some from our conversations, but for the bio bits I've relied almost exclusively on the many times Haggard's already gone on record, at length, about his life: Most notably I've relied on his two autobiographies, the stylish _Sing Me Back Home_ (from 1981, written with Peggy Russell) and the gussied-up transcription _House of Memories_ (1999, with Tom Carter), plus a half dozen or so lengthy magazine profiles over the years, the 2010 documentary _Learning to Live with Myself_ , and countless reviews and previews in daily and weekly periodicals stretching across forty years.

I'm much less interested in recounting Haggard's life story for its own sake (that is, in trivia) than in engaging the character Haggard and his audience have created through the decades. What I hope to offer is strong-minded criticism—close listening, in historical and social context, to one of the singular careers in American popular music. Haggard has, at least as of this writing, released a staggering eighty-plus albums (a total that nearly doubles if you count best-of sets and other anthologies), so what follows isn't comprehensive—many of my own favorite Haggard tracks don't get so much as a mention in what follows. I am going to focus overwhelmingly on the first half of his career, roughly the middle 1960s through the middle 1980s, when Haggard created the bulk of his best music. I particularly want to look at that period in the late Sixties and early Seventies when his music mattered most widely and intensely—and helped to invent the America we live in today. Let's call that Merle's Muskogee Moment, those years when Haggard's work intersected with both the headlines and the pop charts, thanks mostly to his era-defining hit "Okie from Muskogee."

At this point in his career, Merle Haggard _is_ the Okie from Muskogee, a perception as prevalent among fans as detractors. So our first order of business is a reminder that the man known as "the Okie from Muskogee" is neither. Merle Haggard is not, as his image-defining anthem concluded, "from Muskogee, Oklahoma, U-S-A." Strictly speaking, he isn't even an Okie, not in the so-they-loaded-up-the-truck-and-they-moved-to-Californy sense seared into our collective imaginations by John Steinbeck's 1939 _The Grapes of Wrath_ and John Ford's film version of the novel from the following year; by the Farm Security Administration (FSA) photography of Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Ben Shahn; and by the _Dust Bowl Ballads_ of Woody Guthrie.

Merle Haggard missed the migration so indelibly documented, and mythologized, by those earlier artists. His story skips the Exodus and begins in the Promised Land, which in his people's version of the American Dream meant the San Joaquin Valley, county of Kern, in a little town (at the time, not much more really than a glorified Hooverville) called Oildale, situated just on the outskirts of the city of Bakersfield, California, U-S-A.

Historians have noted that the movement of southerners during the last century to the industrial cities of the north and to the corporate farms and oil fields of the west shares revealing parallels with the experiences of European immigrants to America. Both groups were viewed as unwelcome, not-quite-white outsiders. As both consequence of and contribution to that perception, they settled in tight-knit communities—in a Little Italy, say, or a Little Oklahoma—where the old country's food ways, entertainment preferences, religious practices, and other customs to some degree persisted, providing continuity and comfort to displaced people, and where substantial quantities of emotional energy, not to mention one's paycheck, remained devoted to the places and people left behind. Route 66 stands in the Dust Bowlers' imagination as something akin to the place held by Ellis Island in European immigrant lore. Crowded labor camps were these migrants' tenement slums. "Okie" was their Mick or Polack, wop or kike.

In the logic of this comparison, Merle Haggard isn't an immigrant himself, but first-generation, a child of immigrants. And like fellow first-generation songwriters George and Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg (whose parents were Russian Jews), or like Jerome Kern and Sammy Cahn (the sons of German and Austrian Jews, respectively), Merle was born in the Promised Land to parents whose identity would forever be bound up with the Old Country.

Put another way, Haggard isn't a latter-day Tom Joad, yanked from the silver screen and into America from the last reel of John Ford's _The Grapes of Wrath_. He's John Ford—the artist son of immigrants (Irish, in the director's case) who's heard the ancestors' stories of struggle and discrimination all his life, even been on the receiving end of some of that contempt, but who ultimately can only imagine the thrill and terror of creating a new life in a new land that, to him, isn't new at all but just . . . home. And who then turns those imaginings into art.

I like this way of thinking about Haggard because it places him in the company he deserves—not only with fellow legends of country music, but right alongside any and all contributors to our Great American Songbook, and shoulder-to-shoulder with Great American Artists, period. This perspective can aid us, too, in trying to unravel "Okie from Muskogee," both in terms of the button-busting pride the song affirms in its bear hug of a particular identity and the deep ambivalence it betrays toward that identity. The song points straightforwardly to what Merle Haggard feels he shares with his parents as a birthright, but it also underscores the great distance he feels, inevitably, from their experience, separated as he is from it by so many years and miles, not to mention by the twists and turns of his very different life. When first uttered in 1969, "I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee" was itself evidence of that distance, of just how far Haggard had come. After all, in the years after his parents transplanted to the San Joaquin Valley—that is, in the place and at the time their son would grow up, in the 1940s and 1950s—if you'd called Merle an "Okie," this future working-class hero likely wouldn't have taken it as some folksy honorific. He probably wouldn't have taken it at all, and might've even opted to kick your teeth in for a witty rejoinder.

**"Hungry Eyes," 1969**

"A canvas-covered cabin stands out in this memory I revive . . ."

That's how Merle begins his greatest record, but before he can even get his thoughts together, he's being pricked by the sharpened-knife's edge of James Burton's acoustic guitar— _A canvas_ (stab) _covered cabin_ (stab) _stands out_. . . . Those stabs, and the way Merle's voice flinches ever so slightly in response, are our first signals that this particular backward glance will not be in the least "nostalgic." That's a label routinely used to describe country music, and Haggard's music specifically, sometimes even with good reason. But while "Hungry Eyes" begins with a memory revived, what follows—basically, a laying out of the material conditions that kill people's spirits and that, more slowly, kill people—is not the Good Old Days.

What Merle has in mind is painful even to recall, let alone reveal. In a country that still loves to blame poverty upon the moral failures of the poor themselves, experiences like his are supposed to be shameful. Merle's too-proper, almost genteel "in this memory I revive," then, serves him as a shield. It keeps at arm's length a past the singer isn't at all sure he's prepared to face. And he has to be careful, must maintain a distance (though a _safe_ distance isn't really an option), because he already knows what he's going to find. He remembers his daddy praying for a change that didn't come, and "the loss of courage as [his parents'] age began to show," and all of it reflected in his mother's "hungry eyes."

Merle's song is an American tragedy like something out of Arthur Miller: A father's prayers for a better way of life, ultimately futile; a mother's strong faith, whittled away; the conviction that a change must be on the way, and then . . . no change of any size. As a child, Haggard tells us in the song, he was "just too young to realize that another class of people put us somewhere just below." The way Merle drops down to that "realize" and drags it out . . . _ree-uh-liiize_ . . . the way he makes the word bristle and ball its fists . . . _real lies_ . . . it all makes plain that while Okie kids may have been innocent, they'd get taught a lesson soon enough.

Across the years, this matriarch's eyes still haunt, and Haggard meets her gaze. He wills himself not to blink and dares us to do the same. At each chorus, he has the melody leap tenderly when he says the word "Mama," when he sings the name "Daddy." They hungered, not for luxuries, but only for "things [they] really needed." Yet their lives were such that the most basic human needs—a roof over your head, food in your gut, and would a little respect be too much to ask?—had been elevated to luxuries, could only be _conceived_ as luxuries. Merle pictures all of this, plain as day, and shudders, once again a defensive little boy: _It wasn't 'cause my daddy didn't try_. The music around him sounds hungry and exposed, too, barely clothed for most of the record by acoustic guitar and brushes that nag at a drumhead.

Halfway through, though, a string arrangement rises up, luxurious and evoking every fine thing his parents deserved, every meager thing they needed and couldn't afford. Now, here, Haggard has those strings glitter and shimmer all around him, just for show and just because he can. And because they sound like tears.

"Hungry Eyes" didn't so much as dent the pop charts, but on country radio it climbed to #1 in May 1969. Its all-too-apt B-side was "California Blues." He's headed, Haggard tells us in his version of the old Jimmie Rodgers song, to a place "where they sleep out ev-er-ee night." To hear Haggard sing "California Blues" with "Hungry Eyes" still echoing in your ears makes it hard to miss his point. Folks out west don't bed down under California stars just because the weather is pleasant. They sleep outside because they don't have houses. A "canvas-covered cabin," after all, is just a fancy name for a tent.

A half decade earlier, soul master Sam Cooke had conjured an image similar to the one "Hungry Eyes" recalls with such caution. "I was born by the river in a little tent," Cooke sang in "A Change Is Gonna Come," not merely reviving a memory but marching forward from it with a confidence bred of gospel community and shared struggle. _I know that a change is gonna come_.

Half a decade later, "Hungry Eyes" cries a reply, but from his dead-or-dying end of the 1960s, Merle Haggard doesn't sound confident; he sounds alone. He's seen people who prayed for a better life, too, he insists, people with faith just as strong. _But I don't recall a change of any size_. He sure as hell recalls the unanswered prayers, though, and he'll never forget those eyes.

**The Roots of His Raising**

In 1938, the agricultural economist Paul Taylor (aka Dorothea Lange's husband) delivered an address to the Commonwealth Club of California entitled "What Shall We Do with Them?" "Them" were the Okies, and Taylor had bad news for his well-heeled and already alarmed San Francisco audience: "[B]etween the middle of 1935 and the end of 1937," and "by automobile alone," at least 221,000 "them" had entered the state of California. This total, we now know, included four members of the Haggard family. It was in the middle of 1935 that James and Flossie Haggard loaded their two kids into a 1926 Chevy and motored west on Route 66. And it was in 1937, in California, that Flossie gave birth to the family's third child, a boy, whom she and James named Merle Ronald.

Save for a few years' residence in Nashville during the close of the 1970s, California is where Jim and Flossie's youngest has lived his entire life. He was, however, awarded the status of "Honorary Okie" in 1969. We can hear the public presentation of the honor on the album he released later that year, _Okie from Muskogee: Recorded "Live" in Muskogee, Oklahoma_. The mayor of Muskogee, milking the biggest Chamber of Commerce moment he'd ever have, awards Haggard the key to the city and declares the thirty-two-year-old singer an official Okie. "I've been called one all my life," the Hag laughs. "I might as well put the pin on." Then, to great cheers: "I'm proud of it!"

"I wasn't actually born here in Muskogee," Merle explains a bit later, by way of introducing the song that made the award possible. "But . . . I think most all of my dad's folks were born between here and Checotah somewhere." He'd never visited before, but "Muskogee was a word and a town that I've heard about since I was knee-high."

Both of Merle's parents, as well as his two older siblings, Lowell and Lillian, were from the general Muskogee vicinity. The four of them left northeast Oklahoma and lit out for California on July 15, 1935, at "about eleven o'clock in the morning." We know the date and hour of their departure thanks to an interview Merle's mother did with _American Heritage_ in 1977 (she was about to turn seventy-five), part of a feature on Dust Bowl refugees and their escape hatch of choice, "Route 66: Ghost Road of the Okies." Flossie Haggard's account is iconic, as if it had been ripped straight from John Steinbeck's typewriter. Flossie remembered that the Haggards "headed for California on Route 66," at that point still unpaved for long stretches, "as many friends and neighbors had already done." The family's "1926 model Chevrolet which Jim had overhauled" was crammed with much of what they owned, and it pulled a two-wheel trailer piled high with the rest:

We had all our groceries with us—home sugar-cured bacon in a lard can, potatoes, canned vegetables, and fruit. We camped at night and I cooked bread in a Dutch oven. . . . My sister Flora and family had gone to California a year before, so she sent us forty dollars to pay our expenses. I know now it took a lot of nerve to start so poorly equipped, but the Good Lord was with us and we made it in four days.

In a 2003 interview with music writer Dave Hoekstra, Merle remembered his father telling him that the trip actually took seven days, not four, but whatever its length, the journey wasn't without harrowing moments. In the breath-robbing heat of an Arizona summer, the Chevy broke down. And then their water ran out:

[J]ust when I thought we weren't going to make it, I saw this boy coming down the highway on a bicycle. He was going all the way from Kentucky to Fresno. He shared a quart of water with us and helped us fix the car. Everybody'd been treating us like trash, and I told this boy, "I'm glad to see there's still some decent folks left in this world."

Worsening their troubles, Flossie was ailing. So when a filling station attendant suggested they wait for nightfall before making their way across the Mojave Desert, they took his advice and briefly camped just across the Colorado River from Needles, California. When at last they reached the lush San Joaquin Valley, Flossie recalled:

We found many of our friends living in shacks made of cardboard or anything that could make a shelter from the sun, and provide a place to call home. They were working people, they did anything they could find to do, mostly picking fruit until cotton-picking time. Many lived principally on cull fruits that the growers rejected and which could be gotten without cost.

This, too, is all very Joads-ian. Take a picture and it would fit nicely into an exhibit of Dorothea Lange photos. Give it a melody and you'd have a Woody Guthrie song. Better yet, you'd have a song Merle recorded in 1968 called "California Cottonfields."

"Cottonfields" opens with a deep, foreboding nylon-string guitar lick, courtesy of Nashville Cat Jerry Reed. That kickoff has always reminded me a bit of thunder rumbling in the distance: Could be a storm's on the way, it says. But only on the way, and only maybe, so warnings are shoved quickly aside in favor of James Burton's Dobro, which dances about with a sprightly, aspiring spring in its step. Merle sets the scene: A poor family's patriarch dreams of getting out from under his "run-down, mortgaged Oklahoma farm," then finally saves and scrapes together the Do-Re-Mi to do it. He loads his family and a few belongings into an old Model A while kin, friends, and other neighbors drop by either to pick the bones ("Some folks came to say farewell and see what all we had to sell") or to wish them luck ("Some just came to shake my daddy's hand"), and then the man and his family are off, California-bound.

"California was his dream of paradise," Merle explains. Here's why: "For he had seen pictures in magazines that told him so." Merle's voice catches just a bit at that, choking up in bitter sympathy. At each chorus, the melody launches Hag's baritone with an almost anthemic lift, then yanks his voice back to dusty, dissatisfied earth. That's because Haggard knows, now, what the song's father didn't know, then; he knows that the truth of that dream wasn't going to be a paradise at all but "labor camps . . . filled with worried men with broken dreams." He knows California would likely offer the man, at best, only backbreaking work at crap wages. And that some rich man's cotton fields would be "as close to wealth as Daddy ever came."

The Haggards were lucky as hell in California. When they arrived in the summer of 1935, Jim and Flossie got work, almost immediately, at a small dairy, milking and tending forty Holsteins. This good fortune helped the Haggards avoid the prospect of what Steinbeck once described with grim irony as "Starvation under the Orange Trees." Nor did Merle's parents do time as what Steinbeck elsewhere termed "The Harvest Gypsies." Merle's future rival/friend Buck Owens called them "fruit tramps," those migrant laborers who moved up and down the state picking plums and lettuce, working the California apple orchards and cotton fields. The dairy gig lasted only a couple of months, but fortune again smiled on the new Californians. At a time when migrant workers were typically paid twenty cents an hour or less (and frequently had to strike to get it), Jim Haggard got on as a carpenter, for twice that amount, with the Santa Fe Railroad.

Jim and Flossie and the kids didn't have to reside for long in one of the state's many crowded labor camps, either. The Haggards succeeded in getting a refrigerated train car to live in. Flossie recalled that its owner was looking for "someone to cut windows and doors to make it livable . . . she offered us nine months rent to do this work." Haggard family lore, per Merle's second autobiography, _House of Memories_ , has it that this woman was reluctant to set the Haggards loose on converting the reefer: "I've never heard of an Okie who'd work," she sneered. "I've never heard of one who wouldn't," Jim snapped back.

"We moved in on September 15, 1935," Flossie continued. "It was a difficult task, cutting through several inches of steel, wood and insulation, after working a full day's work at a job. But when we finished it was a comfortable place to live." Flossie kept a garden and canned what she could. These were difficult times for the Haggards, but they only had to look to family and friends, their extant dreams of paradise dashed by wage slavery in oil fields or cotton patches, to know for certain things could be far worse. "I can see Mom and Dad with shoulders low, both of them working a double row," Merle sings in another of his Okie ballads, "Tulare Dust," but reality was different. While James Haggard had spent more than his share of time in the cotton fields of Oklahoma, the Haggards avoided that fate in California. "My husband could pick 500 pounds of cotton a day," Flossie said in 1977, "but fortunately he never had to."

"California Cottonfields" has been among my favorite Haggard tracks since I first heard it as a college undergraduate in the early 1980s. It spoke of unrealized aspirations I understood all too well having watched the men in my own family work and dream and grow old, of blue-collar dreams that begin as sure things, grow ever more elusive, then fade to one more dead end, eight more hours of shoveling dirt or laying tar, and it reminded me, yet again, of what I hoped to avoid by going to college in the first place. The words to "California Cottonfields" made my heart swell and break while its rhythms swung with subtle ferocity—a potent combination. It's a testament to the intimate emotional presence of Merle's vocals and to his savvy in selecting material—and to my own youthful faith in "authenticity"—that it never occurred to me, then, that this great Merle Haggard song might not have been written by Merle Haggard. Already I knew his songs included some memorably dramatic embellishments: Haggard "turned twenty-one in prison" all right, as "Mama Tried" begins, but he wasn't "doing life without parole." Still, I figured it was just common knowledge that Merle's songs were autobiographical.

"Cottonfields" blends seamlessly with Haggard's Okie image, and it particularly echoes "Hungry Eyes." Both songs begin with what we're told is personal history, a past buried for a time but now willfully unearthed. "Cottonfields" opens with "My drifting memory goes back to the spring of '43 . . . ," "Hungry Eyes" with one of the great first lines in all of country music, "A canvas-covered cabin in a crowded labor camp stands out in this memory I revive." The father in "Cottonfields" hopes for a change of luck, but the narrator/son shakes his head at the very idea: "[T]he only change that I recall is when his dark hair turned to silver-grey." The narrator/son in "Hungry Eyes" remembers his dad praying for better times, too, but God appears unmoved by these pleas, so the story's the same in the end: "I don't recall a change of any size. Just a little loss of courage as [his] age began to show."

A bit later, I bothered to check the writing credits (a good habit!) and found, to my initial disbelief, that "Cottonfields" wasn't written by Haggard, but cowritten by Dallas Frazier and Earl Montgomery. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dallas Frazier was one of the most successful songwriters going, penning a string of indelible country, pop, and rock hits as diverse as "There Goes My Everything," "All I Have to Offer You (Is Me)," "Beneath Still Waters," "Alley Oop," "Mohair Sam," and "Elvira," among quite a few others. In 1943, though, Frazier was just another Cali-bound Okie, a three-year-old kid out of Spiro, Oklahoma. When Dallas and his parents arrived in the San Joaquin that year, his folks went straight to the fields. "My dad and mother worked in orchards and what have you," he explained to me. "I think they pulled the olives and picked up potatoes, too, but mostly they picked cotton. . . . My first job was picking cotton. I was six. We lived in labor camps.

"Like the one Merle sings about," he volunteered. "Canvas-covered cabins, you know. They would build a hardwood floor, just out of boards, and then they would stretch a little canvas frame over it." Which isn't to say that "California Cottonfields," with its opening images of an abandoned plow, left-behind canned goods, and a loaded-down jalopy, is simply a musical snapshot borrowed from the Frazier family album.

"Imagination always gets into songs," Frazier reckons. "There might be a root of truth, and there's things in that particular song that is true. I think my dad did have a Model A first time we drove out [to California]. But I don't remember it all, either. I was too small, just a kid. So, it's dramatized. I tell you what, though, my dad didn't have a farm to sell [unlike the father in "Cottonfields"]. My dad was born poor and he died poor. And he was poor all in between."

In an early chapter of _The Grapes of Wrath_ , Steinbeck famously likens his westward-bound Okie clan to a "land turtle"—slow-moving but patient. Haggard's parents, by contrast, seem to have had a bit of the jackrabbit in them. They spent the Twenties springing about the country, settling here and moving there. Up in Chicago, Jim got on at a steel mill in 1925, then relocated his family several times—first to Indiana, then to Pennsylvania, then Ohio—all while remaining employed by the same outfit. What's more, when Merle's parents and siblings came to California in 1935, they were actually making a return trip. They'd lived in California a few months in 1929, moving there for Flossie's health (her doctor recommended a warmer climate) and in search of a better way of life. On the road and in the big city, the Haggards necessarily acquired a worldliness that belies the ignorant Okies of stereotype.

And the Haggards want you to know it. They sympathize with the migrant masses, but take pains to distinguish themselves from them, and they aren't alone. Market economies create winners and losers by their very nature, a truth that's easier to ignore when times are flush, but that was impossible to avoid during the Great Depression, especially for working-class folks only just scraping by before the Crash. One angle people work to secure their shaky status in desperate times is to shove for position, in whatever puny ways they can, up the class ladder, insisting loudly upon what we might call their essential human dignity: _I've never heard of an Okie who_ wouldn't _work_. A simultaneous tactic is to smash the fingers of those clinging to rungs just below, buying whole into assumptions that deny others' dignity even while asserting your comparative worth: _Everybody'd been treating us like trash_. Flossie's irritation is simple enough to decipher. Her family didn't deserve such treatment, because her family was decent. Trash was other people. Always is.

An All-American working-class attitude, that—as hopeful as it is defensive. Merle's mother stressed during her _American Heritage_ interview that welfare was one place the Haggards never were. Merle's older sister, Lillian, underscores a similar point in a series of remembrances collected in Merle's first autobiography, _Sing Me Back Home_. "There's something else I've always wanted to clear up," she writes. "We were not papershack poor. My father was a farmer and a rancher in Oklahoma when he met my mother." Likewise, Merle emphasizes that "Unlike most of the Okies, Mama and Daddy were making it on a forty-acre farm they had leased. . . . The farm was producing at an average rate," he says, "and Daddy had himself a good team of work horses, a wagon, some farm equipment and a '31 Model-A Ford."

Make no mistake: The Haggards' life in Oklahoma was a difficult one. But they weren't going hungry, either. The first acres they'd leased upon returning from California had been sold out from under them. They'd had to start over, again, but now they had a few cows for milk. They raised some hogs and grew a little cotton; they had a new car; they were getting by. The Haggard family was certainly doing better than most of their neighbors, many of whom were even then pulling up stakes to motor west. And they couldn't have helped but understand that the lesson of each departure was that it takes only a bad break or two for everything to unravel, for "getting by" to descend to "scraping by" and, finally, "good-bye." In the Haggards' case, Bad Break #1 was a drought in 1934 that devastated their crop. Bad Break #2 was a fire that destroyed their barn and its contents later that year.

Okie legend aside, the so-called "Dust Bowl" refugees mostly weren't chased out of Oklahoma—or any of the other "Okie" mother countries, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and Texas—by the Dust Bowl itself. In _American Exodus_ , James Gregory notes that of the hundreds of thousands of southwestern migrants to California, only about sixteen thousand hailed from the Dust Bowl proper. So forget dust storms. The Okies confronted a perfect storm of misery and dislocation—technological transformations piled on meteorological and economic crises, often exacerbated by personal devastations like the fire at the Haggard place, all stacking up, trouble upon trouble, to send people packing. Overproduction of wheat and cotton lowered prices for those cash crops after World War I, contributing to depression in the early 1920s. In the Thirties, many landowners who were paid to keep acres out of production used the money to buy tractors and other equipment, further reducing the need for farm labor and speeding the end of a sharecropping system that even in the best of times provided workers little more than subsistence living. "Then came the drought and the grasshoppers," Paul Taylor wrote in "What Shall We Do with Them?" "[W]hole sections of the rural population already loosened by the accumulating forces of successive depressions were finally dislodged by a catastrophe of nature." That was why, Taylor explained, even as the droughts ended in the late Thirties, "the tide of refugees flowing westward scarcely slackens."

After their barn and feed went up in smoke, the Haggards moved a few miles away, to Checotah, but only temporarily. "Mr. Haggard ran a service station through the winter and spring of 1935," Flossie recalled. By summer, they were gone.

The Great Depression drove tens of thousands of Okie families to leave their homes, but Americans had been flocking to California for several decades by the time the Haggards headed west for good. That line in "California Cottonfields," the one about paradise-promising magazine photos, points to one of the reasons. California had long been ballyhooed in popular culture, not to mention by the state's various chambers of commerce, as a land of unlimited opportunity and abundance, a place where the daring and ambitious could strike it rich quick or at least achieve, taking what no doubt would be only a slightly longer view, the Jeffersonian ideal of small-farm ownership. Slick magazine spreads promoted a cornucopia of natural riches and a Mediterranean-like climate, while handbills from wealthy California farmers associations, circulated far and wide, promised plentiful employment at high wages. If you wanted to achieve the American Dream, California was the place to be.

The state's in-house marketing department was Hollywood. Think, for instance, of King Vidor's wonderful 1928 silent comedy, _Show People_ , where Marion Davies plays a small-town Georgia girl who journeys west to become a movie star . . . and becomes one! Or of 1934's _It's a Gift_ , in which W. C. Fields's character relocates to sunny southern California to live the sweet life running an orange grove only to get rich instead via a sweet real estate deal.

_It's a Gift_ opens with a Victrola needle dropping on a 78 rpm platter of Al Jolson's "California, Here I Come." California's the place, Jolson shouts to the world on that 1924 hit, "where bowers of flowers bloom in the spring" and where "each morning at dawning birdies sing at everything." Jolson's picture isn't in a magazine, but it nonetheless paints California as a "Big Rock Candy Mountain" come to life—and only a few days' drive away. "A garden of Eden" as Woody Guthrie phrased the expectation, "a paradise to live in or to see." Long before the Depression, Americans, the Haggards included, were jumping at the chance to go to California.

But the Okies didn't jump in the Thirties; they were pushed. The difference between earlier generations of California newcomers and the ones who arrived during the Diaspora of the Great Depression—the difference between the Haggards of 1929 and the Haggards of 1935—is the difference between "Where do I want to go?" and "Where in the world _can_ I go?" It's the difference between the eager optimism of Jolson's "California, Here I Come" ("Open up that Golden Gate!") and the desperation of, say, Woody Guthrie's Dust Bowl–era adaptation of "Goin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad" ("I'm looking for a job at honest pay. . . . My children need three square meals a day"). The immediate prods for heading west naturally varied from family to specific family—"baked out" or "tractored out," "burned up" or "blown away," a bad case of ramblin' fever, or just plain busted. But as Guthrie sang in another of his songs from that time, the out-of-options result was all too often the same: "So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh."

When Merle's parents left Oklahoma in 1935, they were but drops in a flood of white working-class families who at that moment were being swept out of the southwest and toward work in the oil, fruit, and cotton fields of the Pacific Coast. They hungered for Something Better, but would have settled for Things They Really Needed. Frequently they got neither, because "another class of people put [them] somewhere just below."

More than _just_ , actually. The California establishment has always worked overtime to ensure that its cheap immigrant laborers of the moment—the Chinese in the nineteenth century, Mexicans in the 1920s and '30s, and straight on through to today—were put in their place, and that they damn well stayed there. True to form, then, Californians higher up the class chain perceived the influx of so many southwestern refugees not so much as a flood but as a plague or infestation. James Gregory and fellow historian Peter La Chapelle each note that Golden State newspapers and magazines, including _California_ , the official publication of the state's Chamber of Commerce, frequently reported upon these new arrivals as if they weren't humans at all but dumb and dangerous animals, as rats or roaches, an "ever oncoming horde of undesirables" that "swarmed" and "smothered" the state. The newcomers were called ignorant and lazy, freeloaders, scum. The _Los Angeles Times_ regularly referred to the migrants as "white trash." Everywhere they were portrayed as shiftless indigents who bred incessantly, were prone to crime, were so naturally filthy as to pose a public health risk, and just more or less threatened the decline of western civilization as a whole. Up and down California's Central Valley, signs read: "No Okies."

Or as Merle recalled, with characteristic understatement, for a short film honoring his 1994 induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame: "They called my father Okie. Wasn't sometimes all that friendly when they said it."

"Yes, there was a lot of prejudice . . . ," Dallas Frazier remembered. "You were white trash from Oklahoma, was all. You were despised. California, the native Californian, felt they had been invaded. Being in those camps was at the bottom of the barrel as far as life goes. It was."

When we think of art and artists inspired by the Dust Bowl, Haggard is right there on the short list today with Steinbeck and Ford, Lange and Guthrie. But don't tell Merle that.

During the sensation that was "Okie from Muskogee," and coming on the heels of common-man Haggard hits like "Hungry Eyes" and "Workin' Man Blues," some reporters, figuring they'd put two and two together, asked Merle what he thought of Woody Guthrie, himself proud to be an Okie from Okemah. At the time, Haggard claimed he didn't know who Woody was. Well, why would he? Guthrie never sold many records, was barely known, even in Oklahoma, and was long gone from California by the time Merle would have been paying attention. Then again, Haggard is a history buff with a well-developed specialty in the tight connections between Okie and Cali music cultures . . .

But Merle's seemingly studious lack of interest in Guthrie aside, the Haggard clan surely could be expected to recognize their family legend mirrored back to them in the black-and-white images of Hollywood movies and FSA photos, would recognize their lives in the parched voices of Popular Front–era song and story, particularly _The Grapes of Wrath_. That's what Kris Kristofferson thought. In 1971, when he was among the very few country songwriters keeping up with Haggard's sky-high songwriting standards, Kristofferson told journalist Paul Hemphill that the way for Merle to quell the liberal criticism brought on by "Muskogee," and its even more strident follow-up, "The Fightin' Side of Me," would be to record an album-length tribute to _The Grapes of Wrath_. "That'd bring 'em back to roost," Kristofferson figured. It would also have furthered the connection people were making between Haggard and Guthrie, who in 1940, with "Tom Joad," had done something similar to Kristofferson's suggestion.

Kristofferson's idea might have seemed like a no-brainer, but it was never going to happen. In his liner notes to _Untamed Hawk_ , the first of three Haggard box sets released by Bear Family Records, Dale Vinicur informs that "Merle and his family have always taken issue with the Steinbeck _Grapes of Wrath_ characterization of the California migrants as a hopeless and pathetic population." Trash Is Other People.

"Most of [the Okies] weren't tramps," Haggard told Vinicur. "They were just people that were relocating. Proud people that were being transplanted because of a drought. The thing that [Steinbeck] did not capture, the thing he left out, was the ingredient called pride. He had these people making some sort of forced migration like the Cherokees out of Tennessee. And it wasn't that way. They came out here with pride in their eyes."

This appraisal is revealing. Pride, after all, would seem to be just about all that poverty-stricken outlaw Tom Joad has—and he has it in abundance. At the very least, Steinbeck's Joad family is no more lacking in pride than the parents Merle creates in "Hungry Eyes," who remain hungry while losing courage with the passing years. In any event, forced relocation, whether via the Trail of Tears or Route 66, hardly precludes one from proclaiming, as did Merle in the title of a 1969 hit, "I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am." Perhaps Merle is confusing Steinbeck's _The Grapes of Wrath_ with the portrayal of poverty-stricken Georgians in Erskine Caldwell's genuinely hopeless and pathetic _Tobacco Road_. Or maybe for some readers Steinbeck's work has become conflated, however bizarrely, with that era's whole cruel climate of antipathy for, and abuse of, the very people presented so sympathetically by Steinbeck and Haggard alike.

"That's not our story," Haggard told _Rolling Stone_ 's Jason Fine in 2009. "We didn't yield to the Depression."

Dallas Frazier's song "California Cottonfields" is like a movie, full of wide shots and narrative sweep, akin to _The Grapes of Wrath_. Merle Haggard's "Hungry Eyes" is a photograph, and a close-up at that. That's typical—Haggard songs tend to be stingy with story, preferring instead the meditative expression of one sort or other of anxious emotion. The recording Merle and his Strangers made of "Hungry Eyes"—cut late in 1968, topping the country charts early the next year—is a musical adjunct to, and the artistic equal of, "Migrant Mother," the photograph that Dorothea Lange took of Florence Thompson in 1936. The women in both works, Lange's "Migrant Mother" and Haggard's "Mama," document an internal war between pride and inferiority, dignity and shame.

Merle wasn't raised by his parents in a canvas-covered cabin, let alone in a shelter, so-called, as tenuous and inhumane as the propped-up, open-air half-a-hut where Lange photographed Thompson and her children. But he grew up in a repurposed train car, which is disgrace and honor enough. And his aunt and uncle did indeed live in a labor camp tent home where Merle stayed often following his father's death. It was there that Merle learned that "Mama never had the luxuries she wanted," even in the Promised Land, even though all she wanted was what she really needed.

What could be more shameful? And I don't mean for the Haggards. _They came out here with pride in their eyes_ , but those eyes, like Florence Thompson's, remained hungry nonetheless. In America.

Dallas Frazier had a minor country hit at the tail end of 1969 with his own recording of "California Cottonfields." It debuted on _Billboard_ 's Hot Country Singles chart just as "Okie from Muskogee" was itself poised to take the top spot. Haggard had cut his own "Cottonfields" back in the spring, and though it wouldn't be released for a couple of years (on 1971's _Someday We'll Look Back_ ), it complemented perfectly the rich, artistic Okie universe he was busy developing at the time. Besides "Okie from Muskogee," there were "Tulare Dust," "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," "They're Tearing the Labor Camps Down," and, of course, "Hungry Eyes," all Haggard originals and all cut within the several months that bookended "Muskogee"'s arrival on the charts. During an only slightly broader period, Merle also recorded several Okie-alluding numbers by other writers: Pride of place goes to Frazier's "California Cottonfields," but there were also Red Lane's "One Row at a Time," Jimmie Rodgers's pre–Dust Bowl "California Blues," Bob Wills's "Cotton Patch Blues," and even the Hank Mills–penned country-pop standard "Little Old Wine Drinker Me." Haggard, playing a heartsick sot in some Windy City tavern, kicks that one off by slurring, "I'm praying for rain in California, so the grapes can grow and they can make more wine."

Taken together, these recordings—call them his Kern County Suite—are a striking portrait of the San Joaquin's Depression-era immigrants, both post- and (less so) premigration, as close as country music is likely to come to producing its own Yoknapatawpha County. The details that Merle voices in these songs, and the characters he gives voice to—"I'm going to California where they sleep out every night," "Everything we had was sold or left behind," "Where's a hungry man gonna live at in this town," "a canvas-covered cabin in a crowded labor camp," "Oh, I miss Oklahoma but I'll stay if I must"—snap the listener to with a shock of recognition, an illusion of the real that's only trebled in power by the back-sore ache in Merle's sunburnt baritone. And never mind that even in the songs he wrote himself, Merle fictionalizes as needed the actual details of his life, and of his family's, for reasons thematic or musical or both. As Norman Hamlet, legend of the pedal steel guitar and a longtime member of Haggard's band the Strangers, once summarized: "A lot of people think the songs [Merle's] done are experiences he's had. Some of them are not necessarily personal experiences, but experiences of seeing other people in the same situation." And turning what he sees into art.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but . . . When Merle sings in his presumably autobiographical "Tulare Dust" that "I can see Mom and Dad with shoulders low, both of them pickin' on a double row," he is making it up; his autobiographies make plain he never saw his parents pick cotton, let alone worked the fields at their side. He's making it up, too, when he tells us in that song's following verse that he arrived in the Golden State with his parents, in the winter, in 1942, as he is in the next verse when he declares, "I miss Oklahoma," a place he never lived. That iconic "canvas-covered cabin" in "Hungry Eyes" was not where Merle grew up or where his "father raised a family . . . with two hardworking hands." It would have been more accurate, autobiographically speaking, for Merle to have written "I'm proud to be a California-born-and-bred son of an Okie from the Checotah area." But it wouldn't have sung as well.

I stress the creative licenses taken here, risk even belaboring them, not to insinuate any dishonesty or deception on Haggard's part. Rather, my aim is to disabuse ourselves of the perception that Merle Haggard is or has ever been a purely, or even a primarily, autobiographical songwriter and music maker. His work is deeply personal, damn near straight down the line—he sings of what he knows and what he knows best is how he _feels_ —but we want to be leery of drawing a straight line from the sincere and personal feelings of Merle's often autobiographically inspired lyrics to the precise life details that people tend to assume when his songs are regularly referred to as "autobiographical." We want to avoid, in other words, that most dead-end of critical formulas, authenticity.

As he presents his earliest years in both _Sing Me Back Home_ and _House of Memories_ , Merle Haggard's story doesn't bring to mind the film version of the Okie-themed _The Grapes of Wrath_ so much as it recalls another John Ford classic, 1941's _How Green Was My Valley_. This comparison casts Haggard in the role of the Roddy McDowall character—baby of the family, small and sickly (young Merle suffered from the fungal infection known locally as valley fever), but also a handsome, whipsmart charmer, doted upon by parents and older siblings. The narrator in Haggard's autobiographies, as in Ford's _Valley_ , is a grown man, deeply nostalgic, reviving tough and cherished memories of the working-class roots of his raising, and both stories conclude with the death of the father.

Jim Haggard died in 1946, when Merle was nine. Back east, his dad had been a part-time musician—he knew his way around a variety of string instruments but was particularly fond of the fiddle—playing at dances and in bars and with his friends. But he gave up that part of his life when he married in 1919. Flossie, wanting a reliable husband and steady provider, insisted on it, especially after their first children were born, Lillian in 1921 and Lowell the year after.

Hag's memories of his father, at least the ones he's willing to share publicly, tend to the generic, even the cliché: Merle going for drives with his father or going fishing, Merle on eager lookout for his father to come home from work each afternoon, Jim taking his son to pick out a puppy. These were "those nine precious years," as he's called them, when Merle had a father by his side. Afterward came that scary, directionless decade when, Merle writes, "something went out of the world that I was never able to replace."

That's how Merle prefaces his blow-by-blow recounting of the story he ever since has identified as the defining trauma of his life, a series of images that "lies still like crumpled paper inside [his] mind." Racing home from church ahead of his mother one Wednesday evening, Merle finds his father sitting still and silent in a darkened living room, weeping. Jim manages to choke out the word "stroke." There's a frantic scramble to a Bakersfield hospital and, over the next few days, Jim's seeming recovery. Next comes a four-hour road trip in Lowell's '39 Chevy to see a specialist in Los Angeles, Merle's memories of the trip punctuated by the father turning in his seat periodically to smile and tap the son's knee. In L.A., Flossie serves her husband and sons lunch on the ground while they kill time waiting for Jim's appointment. "Some . . . city slicker might have seen us in the park and thought we were just another family of red-neck Okies having our baloney and crackers, and in a way we were."

Inside the hospital, Jim is directed to take a seat in a wheelchair. Just then, an artery bursts, and his father's face turns blue. Jim Haggard collapses, crashes, into the chair and is rushed down the hall and away. "I stood there and I saw it, but I don't—or I _can't_ —remember any of it."

Two more brain hemorrhages were yet to come, and a second stroke. Merle recalls the next few days as a blur. He is at his Aunt Flora's house, and then, suddenly, Lowell is there, too. Merle remembers Lowell, a grown man at this point, in his early twenties, taking him in his arms, rocking back and forth and crying. "Merle, we ain't got no Daddy. . . ."

Merle dealt with his childhood directly in "Born with the Blues," a song he wrote and recorded late in his career as a duet with George Jones for their 2006 album _Kickin' Out the Footlights . . . Again_. Jones lays out the first verse, but the story is all Haggard's: "Dad was my hero/God called him away/Mama was lonely/And I was afraid." There's a certain poignancy to that, especially in the context of his typically fetching (if a tad familiar) melody, and if you care at all about his life story, Merle's turn at his lyric is also affecting: "Raised in a boxcar/and born with the blues" is a nicely compressed bit of bio. On the other hand, to swipe a metaphor from Meyer Abrams, "Born with the Blues" is all mirror and no lamp.

More illuminating, and more representative of the way Haggard's art has tended to work, is a song that, in 1976, became Merle's twenty-third #1 country hit, "The Roots of My Raising." If you didn't know any better, you might fairly conclude that the song's story is pulled from the details of the singer's life. That's certainly the impression encouraged by the _Roots of My Raising_ album cover, which shows Merle standing alongside a new Cadillac parked in front of a dilapidated homestead, a city slicker come-a-callin' in the country. That's what the song's about, too, a man going home to see his father.

Again, though, as on so many of his most successful recordings, "The Roots of My Raising" has the feel of autobiography but was written by someone else—in this case, Merle's longtime friend Leonard Sipes, aka country singer Tommy Collins. An Okie latecomer who relocated from the Oklahoma City area to Bakersfield in 1952, Collins wrote "The Roots of My Raising" with his own Oklahoma childhood in mind. "I wanted to capture something of those precious, simple days when you didn't have to lock your house" is how Collins explained it to journalist Tom Roland. "[Y]ou didn't worry about people stealing. You picked people up on the road and gave them a ride without the fear of having a gun pulled on you; if a neighbor's barn burned down, or his house, the other neighbors got together and built him another one. It was a great life."

Collins paints a pretty picture here, but his memories seem too perfect to ring entirely true. No way do they correspond to the Haggards' Oklahoma experience: If neighbors had been able, or willing, to replace their barn when it burned in 1934, Jim and Flossie might never have abandoned Oklahoma in 1935. In any event, Collins left most of these rose-colored memories out of his song. If he hadn't, Merle, whose tendency toward musical nostalgia rarely runs to anything quite so idealized, probably wouldn't have been drawn to record "Roots" in the first place.

The record begins with a swinging little guitar that conjures up earlier times by mimicking the sound of some old Lefty Frizzell record, but is quickly replaced by Norman Hamlet conjuring a pedal steel guitar that sounds timeless or, better yet, outside time's limits, like a dream . . . Merle is returning to some old Oklahoma home place. Upon arrival, he spies his silver-haired daddy sleeping in a chair—and smiling, for in his hand the father is holding a photo of his dear-departed wife, the singer's mother. Merle has journeyed a great distance to be here—he's passed from highway to blacktop to gravel road—but finding his dad at peace is apparently all he needed to see, so he gets back in his Caddy and drives away. . . . Maybe home, to California?

Obviously, this isn't Merle's story, not entirely. But it's close enough for country. When he recorded Tommy Collins's song, in 1976, Haggard's own father was long dead, gone for over thirty years, while it was his mother who was still very much alive. Five years on, Haggard was still able to pose with Flossie for the cover of a gospel album he made especially for her, _Songs for the Mama That Tried_. Thanks to that gospel set and, more so, to songs like "Mama Tried" and "[Mama's] Hungry Eyes," Merle has acquired a strong association with that venerable country tradition, the mother song. The truth, though, is that fathers show up in his songs at least as often. There are the fathers in Frazier's "California Cottonfields" and his own song "Daddy Frank." There's his "I Wonder If They Ever Think of Me," where a Vietnam POW remembers his old man telling him, "You'll come back a better man." There's the father of nine kids in "Workin' Man Blues" who dreams of chucking his responsibilities and catching the next train straight to . . . Anywhere But Here. There's his 1996 version of Iris DeMent's "No Time to Cry" and the plainspoken pain of its opening line, "My father died a year ago today." There's the on-the-road-again dad who "Got a Letter from My Kid Today," and then there's that line from "I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am," which sure _feels_ like it came from his real life: "I keep thumbing through the phone books and looking for my daddy's name in every town." In the Haggard catalogue, there are fathers almost anywhere you look. Desperate dads, pushover dads, absent dads, dads who chase dreams and dads who chase tail, dads who are just plain sons of bitches, dads who are dead. Even "Hungry Eyes" is at least as much about the father who works so diligently to satisfy the mother's hunger, and fails, as it is about "Mama."

It's the father in "The Roots of My Raising" who keeps pulling me back. Or rather the father I imagine Merle is imagining, a father who died young and whom he barely knew but who here is alive and enjoying peaceful golden years. "The roots of my raisin' run deep," he sings, and on that word _deep_ , Merle flies up to what may just be the highest falsetto of his career. "I've come back for the strength that I need/And hope comes no matter how far down I sink/The roots of my raisin' run deep."

The redundant phrasing of that title is probably just a reflection of Tommy Collins's own melodic demands and Okie vernacular. Still, the distance that wording creates resonates. The song title promises that Haggard will find sustenance and inspiration not in his roots, and not in his raising, both of which are California stories, but something more arm's-length: The roots _of_ his raising. Those roots run deep indeed, all the way back to the Oklahoma of family legend. Haggard found in that imagined state—or, more precisely, in the tales he inherited from the real people who loved it and left it—a kind of prehistory for himself that, going forward, he could reshape as reality and myth.

**"Mama Tried," 1968**

Among the songs most closely associated with Haggard today, "Mama Tried" is hands down his most purely autobiographical. Even the song's one well-known fiction—Merle wasn't doing "life without parole"—is every bit as much a concession to artistic demands as an embrace of artistic license. "Instead of life in prison I was doing one-to-fifteen years," he once told the _Knoxville News-Sentinel_. "I just couldn't get that to rhyme."

"Mama Tried" certainly has that It-Happened-Just-This-Way feel. The romantic triumvirate of rhymes that launches the song ("First thing I remember knowin' . . . lonesome whistle blowin' . . . a young'un's dream of growin'"); the in memoriam of its second verse ("dear old Daddy, rest his soul"); the shout-out to a woman who struggled to be both mom and dad to the boy, who saw to it he went to church, who tried to raise him right; even the bit about a twenty-first birthday behind bars—it's all Merle, all true, right up to and including his owning up to being such a headstrong fool that no one, not even his mother, could tell him a damn thing.

Ironic, then, that Merle penned this musical memoir on commission for _Killers Three_ , the B-movie in which Merle made his acting debut in 1968. Adding to the irony, and then multiplying it by a factor of about a thousand, real-life excon Merle Haggard switches sides in the film and portrays a Smokey the Bear–hat–wearing North Carolina state trooper. This might have gone down as the greatest case of miscasting in Hollywood history if only _Killers Three_ didn't also star Dick Clark, America's Oldest Teenager (and the movie's producer), as a pyromaniac who may or may not be gay and who (spoiler alert!) shoots officer Haggard dead in a country diner. An instrumental version of "Mama Tried," billed as "The Ballad of Killers Three," plays over the opening credits while another song Merle wrote, "Killers Three Theme," is dropped between scenes a verse or two at a time to provide exposition or narrate the on-screen action: "He dreamed of California and the new life there would be" or "Johnny drove hard and fast to make his getaway," like that.

Back in the real world, or at least back in a Los Angeles recording studio, Merle gave "Mama Tried" lyrics that are a far cry from its reputation as an ideal Mother's Day radio request. "Mama Tried" isn't the simple and touching apology, however hard-won, of an older-but-wiser son paying rueful tribute to the ever-loving, long-suffering mama who knew best all along. "Mama Tried" doesn't sound rueful at all, not with James Burton kicking off the record with a Dobro lick that skips in breathless anticipation toward whatever adventure the open road holds in store, not with Roy Nichols squeezing off electrical sparks that sound like Merle's once more chasing down a freight train and shouting "Wait for me."

Turns out, "Mama Tried" is less an acknowledgment of all the pain and trouble Merle put Flossie through and more a celebration of his own willfulness, his refusal to be broken. "Mama tried. Mama Tried!! MAMA TRIED!!!" After all these years, those indelible ascending shouts—they may speak of regret, but they _sing_ like victory—strike me less like pangs of a guilty conscience and more and more like a boast. Everyone tried to change his mind, to set him straight, but no one could. _Not even his mother_. "She tried to raise me right but I refused," he sings. He appreciates what his mama tried to do, of course. Really, he does. But not one note here says he wouldn't refuse her again.

**Toward the Bad He Kept on Turnin'**

Merle was nine when his father died. He ran away for the first time when he was ten. Merle and a buddy hopped "a freight train leaving town" after school one day, not knowing where they'd end up. But the trains must have been calling out to Haggard for a while before he found the guts to make his break. The Santa Fe reefer that Jim and Flossie had repurposed into a house sat just yards off the Oildale tracks: The last of the steam locomotives, and the newfangled diesel and electric engines that were rapidly replacing them, clanged by daily, like a siren's call. He clambered aboard.

Lots of kids run away if only in hopes they'll be better appreciated upon return, and as a fair number of Merle Haggard songs remind, it's not just the young who feel the urge to roam. Grown-ups, too, harbor dreams of taking off someday for somewhere, anywhere, as long as it's not here. Indeed, what one 1977 Haggard hit diagnosed as "Ramblin' Fever" is something of an American affliction. We aren't supposed to know our place in this country; we're supposed to seek it out, find or invent it. Instructed from the cradle that we needn't, maybe even that we shouldn't, be content with our lot, Americans like to sing and dream along with that most quintessential of American songs, "Over the Rainbow." Not that we entirely believe it. Eventually, whether our dreams take wing or remain mere flights of fancy, the moral we're expected to take from our wish for escape is that there's no place like home. Sure, the 1939 film version of _The Wizard of Oz_ begins with Dorothy Gale dreaming of getting up and out, over the rainbow to some Big Rock Candy Mountain "where troubles melt like lemon drops," but it ends with Dorothy back where she started, where she was born and, we're to understand, where she belongs. "If I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard," Dorothy attests, "because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with." We might fairly object to this line of reasoning (Lost? Who said anything about _lost_?), but the contradiction's revealing. Dorothy's hard-traveling trip over the rainbow and back enacts an endlessly repeated version of the American Dream: In this country, you can be anything you want to be, but isn't who you already are plenty good enough? When Merle's backing band the Strangers cut an instrumental-only "Somewhere over the Rainbow" in 1973, they made it sound, at first, like someone crying over abandoned hopes, and then like someone snickering at the foolishness of tears.

All of Merle Haggard's music, I think, springs from this same American Dream and ends bound by the same American dilemma. For when Merle went poking around in search of his heart's desire, what he found, and right in his own backyard, too, was a freight train leaving town.

Merle Haggard is a noted train buff, as well as a collector of toy trains and other railroad memorabilia, and I count sixteen train-alluding tracks in his catalogue before he devoted an album to the theme, _My Love Affair with Trains_ , in 1976. This number includes his own Hag-defining "Workin' Man Blues" and "Mama Tried," but the bulk of the tally is composed of Jimmie Rodgers train songs, with the remainder coming from songwriting masters Curly Putman, Roger Miller, and Dallas Frazier.

_My Love Affair with Trains_ is typical in this regard. Of the album's ten tracks, Merle wrote only one: The autobiographical-as-all-get-out "No More Trains to Ride" waves to the boxcar of his youth and to the dad who worked the rails. The rest of the album only sounds autobiographical, the title track most of all. "Ev'rytime I hear the sound of a train a-comin' down that railroad track, I get that faraway look in my eye," Haggard sings, pining to escape his wage slavery. "I'd like to throw my hammer down and take off to some distant town." That's pure Merle, but the words and music are courtesy of Dolly Parton.

The single from Haggard's _My Love Affair with Trains_ , "Here Comes the Freedom Train," was written by one Stephen Lemberg. A top ten country hit, "Here Comes the Freedom Train" was every bit as provincial and optimistic as you'd expect a song with that title to be during the Bicentennial summer, scooting along a boom-chuck rhythm track through "200 years of glory, never to turn back," on its way to a conclusion that, like any good American, is more than happy to conflate national pride with national superiority and historical inheritance with personal achievement: "We stand tall, Americans all," Merle talk-sings. "No honor can be higher!"

Train songs like these, and the prison songs that are their emotional opposite, are in country music's DNA. The recordings now recognized as the genre's first nationwide successes were "The Prisoner's Song" and "The Wreck of the Old '97," a two-sided hit for Vernon Dalhart, the light-opera-warbling Texan turned ur-countrypolitan crooner, in 1925. The Old '97 was a real train, and, in 1903, it really crashed. Other country trains, though, were made-up metaphors of national locomotion. "The Wabash Cannonball," for instance, hightails it so rapidly through Roy Acuff's 1947 classic that it can get from the Atlantic to the Pacific in scarcely two and a half minutes (and a 1968 version by Merle's longtime backing singer and second wife Bonnie Owens travels faster still!). The Orange Blossom Special was an actual train, running along the eastern seaboard from New York to Miami, but in the oft-performed song that real train inspired, specific destinations aren't the point. "Talk about travelin'," countless country vocalists have bragged in "The Orange Blossom Special," "it's the fastest train on the line." Insert impossibly speedy fiddle solo here.

Movement _is_ the point. Trains in country music tend to be valued simply for carrying riders rapidly down the track, for getting them gone. Sick of obligations and people telling you what to do? Start fresh a little farther down the line. If a lover's left you flat, hit the road after her, and if you're tired of her mess, hit the road again. If you're burnt or baked out in Oklahoma, maybe California's the place you ought to be. If you don't love it, leave it. "The train is called America," Merle explains helpfully in "Here Comes the Freedom Train." Movement, and the unencumbered individualism it implies, _are_ freedom.

Country music freedom has its advantages, but it can be a profoundly circumscribed condition, as well, and deeply lonely. In black culture, freedom is a destination, a goal, a human condition to be achieved, and trains (the Underground Railroad, the Gospel Train) are the means for how we might arrive there together, free at last. Sometimes that freedom is to be found in heaven one day, but other times it can be achieved right here on earth, and sooner rather than later. Often, as in the Impressions' "People Get Ready," it seems headed to both destinations at once. The impulse of African American train songs is overwhelmingly collective, aspirational, and leaning toward the utopian. But the southern white working class's most prominent traditions are closer to what Tex Sample calls "populist anarchism"—always on the side of the little guy but understanding that little guy as properly being all on his own. The country audience rides the rails not as a collective but as individuals who can't travel somewhere else to become free. If you're onboard, you're free already. Or at least as free as you've got any right to expect.

That first time he hopped a freight Merle made it all the way to Fresno before a "yard bull" caught him and notified his terrified mother her son was safe. "Why in the world would you run away?" is what Flossie wanted to know, but to Merle her question made no sense. He couldn't make Flossie see that he hadn't run away but was only looking for the adventure he'd find, or that might find him, somewhere down the track.

Whatever he called it, running away quickly became a way of life for Merle. Grown-ups rise each morning and go to work; Merle got up each day and ran. He ran from teachers and homework and the truant officer, and he ran from the rules and expectations of his mother and older siblings. He ran from anyone and everyone, it appears, who demanded he stand still long enough to be told what to do. A teacher complained on one of his report cards that he was forever staring out the window, he told _Look_ in 1971. "But I was writing songs."

Or plotting his next escape. During his freshman year at Bakersfield High, Merle showed up a grand total of ten days. Confounded by his chronic truancy, the principal at Bakersfield High suggested that perhaps a weekend in juvenile hall would scare the boy straight. Merle's family agreed, but the plan backfired badly. Merle knew he'd done nothing to warrant what felt to him like a jail sentence—like Flannery O'Connor's Misfit, the young Merle couldn't make "what all I done wrong fit what all I gone through in punishment"—and from then on, when Merle was sent to juvenile hall for skipping school, he tried to escape from there as well, usually successfully. There was no sophomore year.

Why was Merle running? He was running, the Haggard family determined, from the thunder-strike pain of losing his dad, but by their own account it took them far too many years to see it: They knew Jim Haggard's death hit his youngest hard, of course, but because Merle was a boy who kept things to himself, who chewed frantically on the past like a starving dog gnaws on a bone and all without ever breaking silence on his fears and regrets, it hit him much harder even than the family realized at the time. As Merle spiraled out of their control, the Haggards became increasingly protective, overprotective in Merle's view, and he resented it. He resented most any authority figure who wasn't his dad. Since teenage boys who run wild, get drunk, "borrow" cars, and hop freights are pretty much guaranteed to run up against authority figures at every turn, this would prove an ongoing problem—one compounded by his being from the wrong side of the Bakersfield tracks. "I probably wouldn't have done any time at all if I'd been a rich boy," he suggests, not unreasonably, in _Sing Me Back Home_. "But I was just a poor kid."

"Freedom is not free," he observed in the 2010 documentary _Learning to Live with Myself_. "And, you know, if you want to take advantage of the law, you got to have a lawyer to help you. Poor people don't get justice in America, and I was one of those poor people."

There's a crumply black-and-white arrest photo of Merle from around this time: A little punk wearing a leather jacket and a sneer, and with an oily curl hanging down his forehead, the teenage Hag looks a lot like actor Robert Blake as he appeared when portraying murderer Perry Smith in 1967's _In Cold Blood_ , or closer yet like Charlie Starkweather, who had modeled his look after James Dean's and who in early 1958 rampaged murderously across the upper midwest. You can imagine Flossie, middle-class-aspiring and sternly religious, looking at that image of the boy she'd hoped might become a minister and seeing something along the lines of her worst nightmare.

Flossie's dreams were of the solidly bourgeois variety. Back in Oklahoma, a sixteen-year-old Flossie Harp had been a state penmanship champ. The prize was a college scholarship, but her father refused to let her accept it. A year later, in 1919, she married James Haggard, a "footloose person," she told Dale Vinicur, who "didn't worry about tomorrow at all" and whom she'd first met while he was fiddling for a party. For her part, Flossie was about as footloose as a man in leg irons and worried about almost everything. Comfort and safety could only come, she thought, "when a person settles down in one place, at one job, and makes somethin' of themselves." So while Flossie was a music lover herself—she chorded along on the organ at the Church of Christ—she made sure her husband laid the fiddle down more or less for good. When Jim died, Flossie found work keeping the books for a meat company.

With his father gone, siblings grown, and mom at work, Merle became what we'd today call a latchkey kid, which made skipping school a breeze. To keep him out of trouble, the family nurtured his interest in music. Flossie got him violin lessons for a time, but Merle only wanted to play hillbilly tunings, fought with his teacher, and gave it up. When Merle was twelve, his brother gave him his first guitar, a Sears Roebuck job called a "Bronson" that some down-on-his-luck fellow had left for payment at the gas station where Lowell worked. But while music was a fun diversion, it wasn't work. "People like us," Merle has said his family told him more than once, would never find success—they meant security, some material comfort, acceptance, pride—in the music business. Work, and the future it purchased, were to be found only in the fields or an office, on a factory floor or in a store, and by doing well in school. Typical of many Okie families, the Haggards valued education as the clearest path their children had to make something of themselves, so the more Merle Ronald wanted to play and sing, the more his mother and siblings insisted he march his butt back to school. But school felt like a trap to Merle. The older he got, the more he began to think that middle-class stability felt like a kind of trap, too. He kept running.

In 1951, the fourteen-year-old Merle and another boy, nineteen-year-old Bob Teague, hitched all the way from Oildale to Texas. The plan was to visit mutual hero Lefty Frizzell, but either because they had the town wrong or because their idol had moved, the boys settled for visiting Teague's uncle instead. He sent them on their way with a sawbuck and "a half a stick of bologna." It was a coming-of-age adventure Haggard never forgot: On the way out, he had sex for the first time (at a whore house in Amarillo); on the way back, he and Teague were arrested around Los Angeles for armed robbery. They were released a week later when the actual criminals were found, and from there, Merle thumbed a ride back to Bakersfield.

There were fights and court appearances and more trips to juvenile hall. He was such a regular there, he had his own stash of 78s in the rec room. At fifteen, he escaped from juvie, stole a car, and drove it to Arizona, making his way back home by hopping freights and hobnobbing with hoboes. Another time, after another escape, he stole a car and went to Las Vegas. After he was caught that time, he was sent to the Fred C. Nellis School for Boys in Whittier, part of the California Youth Authority, but it couldn't hold him either. After four escape attempts, he was declared "incorrigible" and sent to the Preston School of Industry, a notorious reform school where Haggard acquired a tattoo he wears on his hand to this day: "P.S.I."

The stories Merle Haggard tells about his misspent youth, complete with car chases and close shaves and cases of mistaken identity, sound like scripts for a Burt Reynolds or Steve Mc-Queen movie and are cast with sadistic guards and heartless wardens straight out of _Cool Hand Luke_. (After one escape and capture, he was forced by a guard to jog for hours while being beaten with a leaf rake: "So you boys like to run, do you?") He told his stories in 1981's _Sing Me Back Home_ and told them all again in 1999's _House of Memories_ , but he's been telling the best dozen or so of them in interviews for decades—since at least 1973, when "The Improbable Ballad of Merle Haggard" appeared in _Penthouse_. Some of the tales are broadly comic (like the time he tried to steal a car that, unbeknownst to him, was chained to a tree) and some are poignant (in 1951, he celebrated Christmas in juvie). Others are terrifying, but setting and plot remain the same. Merle Haggard is in a cage: He's out of work or hates his work; he's in juvie or in a relationship; all he wants to do is to go home. Somehow, he slips his bonds and makes a break for it only to discover upon arrival that home, too, feels like a cage.

He was perpetually feeling in these years "a clear and simple pull back to Bakersfield," he's written. "Usually followed by a burning need to leave Bakersfield."

The story of how Merle Haggard finally got sent up the river is like an episode of _America's Dumbest Criminals_. It's Christmastime 1957, and Merle is at the kitchen table, killing a bottle or three of cheap wine with an old acquaintance he'd run into earlier in the day and invited up to the house, and with Leona Haggard (née Hobbs), Merle's wife of just over a year and the mother of his eight-month-old daughter Dana. Merle had been in the Ventura County Jail, doing nine months for grand theft auto, when Dana was born, and he'd just finished a three-month stint on a road gang after trying to seed his own scrap metal business by helping himself to someone else's scrap.

Now, Merle and his buddy are bitching about how America's going all to hell—no money in their pockets and no jobs that pay decent, "the school mess down in Little Rock," _Sputnik_ and Khrushchev and the Soviets. "A workin' man just can't make it no more and that's the God's truth," Merle's friend declares, good and drunk and then some. Every drop as drunk himself, Merle announces he's had it with just sitting around and griping about the way things ought to be. He has a plan, and while it won't fix America it'll goddamn fill their empty wallets.

The three of them stagger out to the car and head down old Highway 99 to Fred & Gene's Café. Merle knows the place well—it's run by a cousin of a buddy—and all they have to do is crowbar open the back door, clean out the register, and hightail it home. Easy as 1, 2, 3. Step one is well underway when, to their three-sheets surprise, the diner's back door bursts open. It's then Merle realizes that, in their inebriation, they'd made one small miscalculation. While they had it in their heads that it was two or three in the morning, it is in fact still only ten or eleven, Fred & Gene's is open, full of customers, and here stands the owner in front of them. The guy recognizes Merle right off, but isn't sure what he and his pal are up to: "Why don't you boys come around to the front door like everybody else?"

At this point, if Merle had been sober enough to retain possession of a few of his wits, the thing to do would have been to quick crack a joke: "Hey, what's a fellow got to do to get a sandwich around this dump anyway?" Merle wasn't sober, though, so instead of talking his way out of trouble, Merle proceeded to do what he'd been doing pretty much all his life. He ran.

And was quickly apprehended. Exacerbating his case, police found in Haggard's car a stolen check protector machine, hidden not very well under a blanket in the backseat. The same blanket, according to the Bakersfield _Californian_ , that covered "the Haggards' 8-month-old daughter, with her parents at the time of the arrest." That was the week before Christmas. On Christmas Eve eve, Merle made one last break for it. Again, from the _Californian_ : Haggard "apparently joined a detail of prisoners on their way to court at 10 a.m. Monday, replacing a man who was being interviewed by a parole officer. [He] joined the group as it was leaving the jail to enter the prison transportation van, and officers said Haggard apparently made his escape at that time." Thirty hours later, he was back in custody.

If this had been his first encounter with law enforcement, and if his family had had connections, or at least money for a decent lawyer, Haggard would likely have served only a short sentence. But because his rap sheet was already so long, he got a maximum of fifteen years, and because of his well-documented habit of escape, he was assigned to serve his time at San Quentin State Prison. Merle Haggard entered there in March 1958, prisoner #A-45200.

Stories from Merle's time in San Quentin are well known among fans. He saw Johnny Cash perform an inspiring New Year's Day show there in 1959, for example, topping a bill that included the rockabilly Collins Kids and a couple of strippers. During his first year, Merle seriously contemplated escaping, but was advised against it by fellow inmate Jimmy "Rabbit" Hendricks: "You can sing and write songs and play the guitar real good. You can be somebody someday." Hendricks saw no such future for himself: He escaped, shot a cop while on the lam, and was eventually executed in the San Quentin gas chamber.

For a time, Haggard didn't see a future either. Back in Bakersfield, his wife Leona had given birth to their second child, Marty (named after singer Marty Robbins), but had stopped visiting or writing, and now he learned she was pregnant again, with another man's baby. He became involved with a gambling ring in the prison, working the beer concession, and when he was discovered blotto on his own homebrew, was punished with seven days' isolation—a turning point in his life. As San Quentin's isolation cells abutted Death Row on what was known as the Shelf, Haggard could hear the talk of the doomed men. One of these was Caryl Chessman, the accused Red Light Bandit, who in 1948 had been convicted of robbery and rape and sentenced to die. He never ceased claiming his innocence, however, and became something of a culture hero to critics of the death penalty and, after several last-minute stays of execution, to the prisoners in San Quentin. Haggard spoke to Chessman while in isolation, identified with him (they'd both spent time at PSI), and began to fear his life was headed in the same direction. "My death flashed before me" is how he puts it in _Sing Me Back Home_.

When the week ended, Merle vowed to change the direction of his life. He volunteered to work in the prison's textile mill, and he auditioned successfully for the official prison band. After two years and pushing nine months, he was released early, for good behavior, on November 3, 1960.

Merle Haggard and prison go together, in the popular imagination, like Ray Charles and blindness or Robert Johnson and a certain crossroads in the Mississippi delta. Even casual admirers, who may know next to nothing about the details of the man's life, can readily affirm that he's an ex-con. The Hag's backstory grants him instant artistic credibility and is inseparable from his appeal: He doesn't just play an outlaw; he's authentic. Never mind that, in Merle's opinion, his prison record reads as his life's most humiliating chapter.

Shame may explain why Haggard, personal history and public reputation aside, has recorded so few prison songs in his career, certainly no more than many other country artists of his generation, and why he's written even fewer. I count only a baker's dozen among the three hundred or so sides he cut during his tenure at Capitol Records, a rate that's slowed even further in the decades since. The exceptions to this rule, of course, are exemplars of his legend. "Sing Me Back Home" is a prison song of the first order and represents Haggard at his definitive best. So does "Mama Tried," though save for its famous half-truth, it's not properly a prison song so much as a blueprint for how to wind up in one. From the other direction, the same goes for "Branded Man," about the disgrace that hounds a con once he's set loose.

The first explicit prison song Merle released, in 1967, was one he wrote. About an imprisoned individual who'd rather swing than live, "Life in Prison" is a harrowing number, but no more harrowing, and no less generic really, than, say, "Life to Go," a song by Merle's eventual pal George Jones that was a big country hit for Stonewall Jackson just as Merle entered San Quentin. Prison life, in particular the details of Merle's life in prison—what it felt like for him to be trapped there, week after month after year—is a songwriting subject he's mostly avoided. No doubt he revives memories when he sings a prison song, whether it's his own or by Dallas Frazier ("Will You Visit Me on Sundays?"), Curly Putman ("Green, Green Grass of Home"), Whitey Shafer ("I'll Break Out Tonight"), or Mel Tillis ("I Could Have Gone Right"). Yet, when it comes to setting down the words and melodies of his own songs, the concrete details of Merle's trip up the river are stories he mostly keeps to himself.

Merle did cut a number called "I Made the Prison Band" in 1967: "I been planning a break since Christmas . . . but now I know that I ain't gonna go!" That lines up perfectly with Merle's real life, but in a twist we've seen before, it was actually written by Tommy Collins, who clearly recognized a good song idea when he heard one.

Haggard sings and writes relatively few literal prison songs. But as a state of mind, Prison competes with Freedom as his paramount artistic focus. Feeling cornered, followed by a burning desire to escape, is what Merle's normally going on about in the many train songs he's recorded, but those represent merely a subset within the great overarching theme of his career. Merle Haggard is "The Running Kind." "Within me there's a prison, surrounding me alone," he shudders in that hit 1978 single. "As real as any walls of stone."

In American popular music, living out on the road, running and rambling 'round, is almost always presented as just an easy, peaceful blast. In such songs—I have in mind Haggard-relevant numbers like the Allman Brothers' "Ramblin' Man," Waylon Jennings's "I'm a Ramblin' Man," Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird," and Glen Campbell's "Gentle on My Mind," but there are hundreds to choose from—in such songs, to be a man of constant movement, to have nothing and no one to tie you down and no need for anyone's help, least of all a woman's, is a self-evident good. Anyone who misunderstands is just one more trap to avoid, one more good reason to hit the road.

Merle has sung similar blues, over and over. In "Ramblin' Fever" and "White Line Fever," in Dallas Frazier's "Too Many Bridges to Cross Over," in "I Can't Get Away" and "The Running Kind" and two or three dozen more, Merle is fed up with where he is or who he's with, and, to prove he was free all along, he lights out. But his music's rule-of-thumb definition of freedom—not "Do your own thing" so much as "Every man for himself"; not individuality but individualism—can feel like no freedom at all. The next town down the line, with its same demands for survival and its new versions of the same demanding people, inevitably begins to feel as cramped and suffocating as the last. So the Hag takes off again, hops a freight or thumbs a ride, until running itself becomes a cage he can't escape, until running becomes its own prison and the only way out is to run. Repeat as necessary.

And it is always necessary. Merle tells us over and over again that running is in his DNA the way train and prison songs are in country music's. Freedom, in the commonsense sense of freedom of choice, of free will and subjective agency, and in the not-so-common-as-it-should-be sense of the development of one's human distinctiveness and the achievement of one's potential, is perpetually insisted upon in Merle's recordings even as its possibility is denied. In Merle's music, freedom is movement, the freedom to leave a place if you don't like it and to be left alone to do it. But this freedom feels very much like no freedom at all because, at least as he presents the case in his music, Merle couldn't stay put if he wanted to. The Hag has no choice in the matter. What the Hag does have is rambling _fever_ , white line _fever_. "Jammin' gears has got to be a fever," he says in one of his several contributions to country music's trucking industry, "Movin' On." There's no cure for this disease; it's just the way he came. "I know running's not the answer," he sings in "The Running Kind," his bravado slipping for just a moment, "but running's been my nature and the part of me that keeps me moving on."

There is an honesty in those lines, and a real misery in the way he delivers them, that doesn't romanticize the running at all. He is at once freedom defending and freedom denying; his slavery remains the essence of his freedom. Merle Haggard's music is so powerful, in part, because he never resolves the contradiction. To his credit, and unlike any artist I know, Merle Haggard lays it out there _as_ a contradiction. "Every front door found me hopin' that I'd find the back door open," Merle croons, with great weariness, in "The Running Kind," his gift for escape extolled with a swagger indistinguishable from regret. "There just had to be an exit for the running kind," he concludes, which is not at all to say he ever really found one.

Never forget. In Merle Haggard's vision, as laid out in "Mama Tried" and reaffirmed for nearly half a century since, it was "a lonesome whistle blowin' and a young'un's dream of growin' up to ride" that led him directly, inevitably, to San Quentin, the way a train can keep on a-movin', but only along its tracks. All those train songs, all that running. . . . Merle never ends up anywhere any better. But he does get gone.

**He Loves Them So**

A Playlist of Early Influences

In 2002, Merle was doing press interviews in promotion of the just-released _Roots, Volume 1_ , an album honoring the C&W records he fell in love with as a working-class California kid halfway through the previous century. "I'm looking back on my life," he told me then, "and the music I used before I had music of my own." What music was that, exactly? _Roots_ offered some answers, but Merle had been scattering clues all along.

Let's play some records.

1. "Mom and Dad's Waltz," Lefty Frizzell (Columbia, 1951)

2. "Mom and Dad's Waltz," Merle Haggard (from _Sing Me Back Home_ , Capitol, 1968)

3. "Always Late (with Your Kisses)," Lefty Frizzell (Columbia, 1951)

4. "Always Late (with Your Kisses)," Merle Haggard (from _Roots, Volume 1_ , Anti-, 2001)

The first time he saw Lefty Frizzell, Merle Haggard was just fourteen. On a summer night in 1951, he squirmed his way near the front of Bakersfield's Rainbow Gardens, but the club was so packed, and the cramped stage set so low, that he was only able to see Lefty after someone handed up a chair for the star to perch upon. Included in Frizzell's set was a pair of soon-to-be country standards: "Always Late (with Your Kisses)" and "Mom and Dad's Waltz," a for-the-ages two-sided single that debuted that August on the national country charts. Years later, Merle wrote that he gazed upon Frizzell that night "in absolute wonder" and that "when he told us that was the first time he'd ever done those songs in public, I felt like I was being included in country music history."

"His songs hit me right in the heart," Haggard explained to me. "And his voice . . . It was strange. It was like listening to my own voice. I had some soul connection with Lefty. It was like somebody had turned on the light. It was like somebody reached around and turned on a switch on my back."

As we've seen, his Be-a-Good-Boy-Now-and-Go-to-School switch was already off by this time. That's how a year or so after seeing Frizzell, Merle Haggard found himself just outside Modesto, California, on a break from bringing in the hay at a cinder block dive bar with the trying-too-hard name The Fun Center. When the bartender asked if that guitar slung on his back was just for show or if he could actually play the thing, the fifteen-year-old chose to prove it was the latter by strumming and singing his way through "Always Late (with Your Kisses)." The guy must've liked what he heard well enough, because he offered Merle five bucks to keep going—Merle Haggard's professional debut. A half century later, when Merle released _Roots, Volume 1_ , that album devoted to honoring music "I used before I had music of my own," he made "Always Late" the lead track.

He'd gotten around to cutting the other song he'd heard Frizzell test drive at the Rainbow Gardens, "Mom and Dad's Waltz," much sooner. Haggard would eventually record Frizzell songs nearly twenty times, not to mention the half dozen or so of his own songs that mention ol' Lefty. But in 1968, when he'd only just established himself as a consistent hit maker and country star, it was "Mom and Dad's Waltz" he chose to be the first.

Merle has covered the signature songs of this or that musical hero at every stage of his career, and in most cases, he makes certain to turn the old music he loves into new music. He transforms classic music into Haggard music. But there's one glaring exception to the rule: When Merle sings a Lefty song, he is likely as not to say to hell with interpretation and to straight-up copy it.

Even though he recorded them more than forty years apart, Merle's versions of "Mom and Dad's Waltz" and "Always Late" are both covers in the old-fashioned sense: They try to sound as close to the original singles as possible. Merle makes certain his 2001 version of "Always Late (with Your Kisses)" begins with the same gravity-defying, Looney Tunes steel lick that boomeranged Lefty's record to life a half century before. What's more, he has the abridged, small-combo edition of the Strangers that's backing him here forgo the improvisational soloing typical of his late-period recordings for low-key, almost lazy restatements of the melody—first by twin guitars, then by the piano, then fiddle. These restatements are note-for-note copies of the trio of aching solos—guitars to piano to fiddle—that laze about the middle of Frizzell's hit.

Merle also tends to _sing_ Lefty songs the way many of us sing along with our favorite records—by impersonating the singer. On that twenty-first-century "Always Late," Merle's sixty-something voice cracks unpredictably, but he's still doing Lefty as close to note-for-note as he's able. On "Mom and Dad's Waltz," cut at that late-Sixties moment when he was entering his prime, a youthful-sounding Merle has his Lefty impersonation down cold. He doesn't merely reveal himself to be influenced by Frizzell's hushed and conversational, almost fragile, croon; he is deliberately, lovingly bent upon sounding _exactly like Lefty_ , like their voices are the same voice. Replicating each of his hero's curlicued vocal lines, Haggard hugs the song's key words and phrases as if reluctant to set them free. The a cappella "I love them so" that ends the record is stretched and squeezed ever so gently until, just as on Lefty's 1951 original, it seems determined to encapsulate a lifetime of gratitude and devotion. Merle cherishes the melody, the notes themselves, sounding convinced that if he releases these words too soon he'll risk losing forever the feelings they convey. And the people who inspired them, too, by whom I mean Jim and Flossie Haggard, of course, but also Lefty Frizzell.

When Merle first began to sing, he sounded just like Lefty. Everybody said so. Once, a friend of his mother's heard him singing in the car to Lefty's first hit, "I Love You a Thousand Ways," and told him he "sounded just like that guy on the radio." Many years later, after Merle and his idol became friends, Frizzell's own mother confessed to Merle that "When I heard you sing [on the radio], I said why that's Sonny. And they said to me, no Mom, that's not Sonny, that's Merle Haggard."

A kid looking to emulate a hero, Merle consciously nurtured the resemblance. Naturally so, since Frizzell was the greatest, coolest singer he'd ever heard—but there was also a part of him that just naturally couldn't help it. Merle's voice seemed to fall into Lefty's without his trying. The teenage Haggard would "borrow" a car for a joyride with a buddy, or head out to Oildale's Beer Can Hill to drink till sunup with pals, but wherever he went he was always singing, always working out an ever-more-precise impersonation of Lefty Frizzell.

The youthful impersonation of a hero is such a common backstory for aspiring country singers that it nearly counts as a rite of passage. The countrypolitan crooner née honky-tonk shuffler Ray Price sang on his earliest recordings in a voice that was at times all but indistinguishable from that of Hank Williams. George Jones idolized Williams and Frizzell both, and sounded like it: "Can you sing," his producer asked at the start of his career, "like George Jones?" Merle had to overcome the same obstacle. Or, to phrase it closer to the way Merle experienced it, he benefited from similar inspiration. When Merle started recording, his manager and first producer Fuzzy Owen would stop him mid-take to warn him, again, that he was maybe sounding a bit too much like ol' Lefty.

This is one way country music understood itself when Haggard was coming up. The path to a distinctive voice, _your_ voice, was inseparable from a knowledge of just where that voice came from. The country audience generally worked from the assumption that those who came before us had things to say that we could still stand to hear; country artists went out of their way to present themselves as links in a chain of tradition. That traditionalist posture was established sometimes by the sincerest form of flattery and sometimes through the recording of tribute songs and albums, but always through continued recourse to a shared repertoire.

5. "My Rough and Rowdy Ways," Jimmie Rodgers (Victor, 1929)

6. "My Rough and Rowdy Ways," Lefty Frizzell (Columbia, 1950)

7. "My Rough and Rowdy Ways," Merle Haggard (from _I'm a Lonesome Fugitive_ , Capitol, 1967)

What we approvingly call "influence" often starts with what we unfavorably term "imitation." Individual style discovered via a period of imitation is a key to unlocking what country music means. Witness, for example, the genre's collective homage to Jimmie Rodgers, the man regarded today as the Father of Country Music. The distinctive vocal styles of country's most recognized genres are each exemplified by men who began their singing careers as undisguised Rodgers mimics: Ernest Tubb, whose quavering twang became the very model for how a Texas honky-tonker should sound; Tommy Duncan, whose easy-does-it croon helped define western swing; Gene Autry, whose dusty alto became the model for singing cowboys; and Hank Snow, who synthesized all these styles into the broad mainstream category marketed, for a time, as Country & Western.

One more son of the music's father, Lefty Frizzell was never an out-and-out Rodgers impersonator, at least not on record, but was profoundly influenced by the Rodgers style. It was Lefty's infatuation with Jimmie's singing and songs that moved him to record the album that led directly to Merle's own Jimmie infatuation. From 1951, _Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, Sung by Lefty Frizzell_ was one of country music's earliest LPs and its first tribute album. Haggard told author Barry Mazor that the first time he heard Frizzell's tribute was also the first time he'd ever heard of Jimmie Rodgers:

[O]ne day my mother and I were standing around in the kitchen and on the radio [Rodgers] came, singing "Blue Yodel No. 6." I said, "That's Lefty with a new record; Mom— _Lefty's got a new song_." And she had a funny look on her face and said, "That's Jimmie Rodgers' song." She had some sort of indifferent posture about it, so I said "I don't understand. Who's Jimmie Rodgers?" And she said "Why he's— _the best_!"

This was probably in the fall or winter of 1951. "Blue Yodel No. 6" was the B-side to Frizzell's version of "Travelin' Blues," one of the single releases from the _Songs of Jimmie_ album and a top ten country hit late that year.

Prodded by Lefty's endorsement, the young Merle set to learning as many Rodgers songs as he could, though of course he sang them, as he sang everything then, by borrowing Lefty's voice. Later, Haggard famously recorded his own Rodgers tribute, _Same Train, a Different Time_ , in a voice unmistakably his own. Back in '51, he'd yet to discover a distinctive style, but he was beginning to intuit that Frizzell's sound and Rodgers's songs might serve like signs pointing the way. "My Rough and Rowdy Ways" especially provided a clue to solving himself.

"The second time I went to see [Lefty] in Bakersfield I was sixteen years old, and he got me up to sing," Haggard told me in 2002, still sounding more than a little amazed five decades later. With the help of a buddy, Merle finagled his way backstage to meet the star of the show. Then, after his pal bragged to the singer that Merle did a pretty swell Lefty impersonation, the kid was kindly asked to prove it. Lefty must have been impressed, or maybe he spotted a way to have another couple of drinks. In any event, the star decided he wanted the kid to sing a number on stage before the start of the next set.

"The owner looked at Lefty like he was crazy," Haggard explained to _Penthouse_ in 1976. "He told him, 'Hey, that crowd didn't pay to hear their own local yokel sing. They came to hear Frizzell.'" That's when the headliner pulled rank, replying with some version or other of "Either the kid sings or I don't." The next thing Merle knew he was doing his Lefty imitation for Lefty's audience. "I got to use his guitar and have his band play behind me. It was quite a thrill. I did two or three songs, and they were well accepted." They were more than just well accepted, apparently, and beyond being a thrill the experience was self-affirming. As he told Dale Vinicur: "I went out on this show and they ripped the seats out—they loved it. And I was a nobody. I went right out in front of Lefty when they were wanting Lefty. Everything was against me and everything went for me. I seen that and I knew that's probably what I was going to do."

"Other than Frizzell's songs, I only knew songs by Jimmie Rodgers," is how he told it to Mazor. "And I remember singing one of 'em, called 'My Rough and Rowdy Ways.'" He'd learned it off the 78 Flossie had given him that year for Christmas.

Listen to Rodgers singing "My Rough and Rowdy Ways" in 1929. Compare it to Frizzell singing the same song at the century's midpoint. Then play Haggard's version cut in 1966. Right there, in just three records and not even nine minutes, you have a pretty nifty capsule history of a genre: its prime movers moving west—Mississippi to Texas to California; its technology improving—brittle to cool to warm; and its style evolving—from vaudeville blues to hot C&W pickin' to pulsing electric thump.

My favorite part of Rodgers's song is its clever second verse: "Sometimes I meet a bounder who knew me when I was a rounder/He grabs my hand and says 'Boy, have a drink.' . . . The daylight comes before I've had a wink." Lefty's "Rough and Rowdy" ditches that economical sketch of how temptation can overwhelm good intentions, just as it passes on attempting Rodgers's signature yodel. A smarter edit is the way Lefty switches out Jimmie's clunky "I may be tough and counted vile" for the smoother "I may be rough but that's just my style." Still, amidst the alterations is "My Rough and Rowdy Ways" itself. Jimmie and Lefty recorded the song approximately two decades apart, but the song remains the same because human beings still wrestle with the same tensions. Jimmie and Lefty both wish to quit their carousing and settle down with their girl in the old hometown. Then they turn right around and no less tenderly sing of their good old ramblin' days and ways.

Two decades down the road, Merle sings Lefty's version. He wants to straighten up and fly right, he really does. But right beside Merle's "I thought I would settle down" sits his "Somehow I can't give up . . . ," each iteration of which inches Merle closer to leaving his gal behind—to tossing his bills and catching a train for another town as he'd later phrase it in "Workin' Man Blues." By the last chorus, you can almost hear the door hitting his butt as he hightails it to freedom. This doesn't mean Merle won't be back as soon as his rough and rowdy ways start to feel a bit too rough, too rowdy, when he hears again the calming call of Home Sweet Home. It does mean that, for as long as he can get away with it, he's damn well going to have it both ways. Because both ways is how he feels.

The old Jimmie Rodgers songs that the teenage Haggard learned from Lefty, and the new songs that Lefty wrote in conversation with Rodgers—these songs spoke to young Merle Haggard. They spoke to him plainly of fear and betrayal, of miscommunications and missed opportunities, of promises made and broken, of loss and sweat and sickness and death—of all the limits built into the world. But the old songs hinted at possibilities, too, and provided the tools to realize them. The world would demand a great deal, those songs said, but in Lefty's voice, Merle found a hint he needn't settle merely for what the world demanded. If Lefty could feel and contain within him both contentment and dissatisfaction, both "I thought I would settle down" and "I can't give up my good old ramblin' ways," then couldn't he feel and contain, and perhaps even resolve, those tensions as well? If he could sing just like Lefty, then why couldn't he sing like whomever he chose? Even like himself.

"More and more," Merle writes in _Sing Me Back Home_ , "I found myself trying to sound like him, sometimes without even realizing it. Lefty gave me the courage to dream."

8. "My Mary," Stuart Hamblen (RCA Victor, 1931)

9. "My Mary," Merle Haggard (from _Pancho & Lefty_, Epic, 1982)

Haggard lore has it that the family's youngest child seemed drawn to music from very nearly his first breaths. Early on, they noticed that the new baby kicked his legs happily along with whatever music might be on the radio; they found it especially amusing that they could start and stop his little legs by switching on and off the radio.

When Merle was just learning to talk, the story goes, he came to his mom demanding "stewed ham." Flossie was surprised by the request, but assumed Merle was just trying to say he was hungry. "Stewed Ham, Stewed Ham," he repeated, now pointing at the radio. Flossie got the message: It was time for Stuart Hamblen's daily radio show.

Hailing from east Texas, Hamblen was at first another singer deeply in thrall to Jimmie Rodgers, and like so many others, he soon built upon that imitative foundation a persona of his own, Cowboy Joe, one of the early singing cowboys. When Hamblen arrived in California in 1930, he was exactly the sort of singer who'd soon take country music nationwide throughout the 1930s and '40s, joining a steady stream of Hollywood movies and Gene Autry platters. He was quickly enlisted as one of the Beverly Hill Billies, California's original country music stars.

In 1934, feeling homesick, he wrote "Texas Plains," then cut it during the debut country music session for Decca Records. For the next two decades, Hamblen was a major presence in the southern and central California country scene, and his songwriting credits eventually boasted a trio of standards: "This Ole House," the oft-covered hymn "It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)," and "(Remember Me) I'm the One Who Loves You," a #2 country hit that lingered on the national charts for half of 1950.

Hamblen's first songwriting success, though, came much earlier. Hamblen cut "My Mary," his wistful reminiscence of a girlfriend back east, in 1930, at his first California session and performed it regularly on his radio programs over the years. "My Mary" has a lullaby melody, dreamy and hummable, of the sort that reminds just how closely intertwined commercial country music has always been with the songs of minstrelsy, vaudeville, and Tin Pan Alley. It's a sentimental song, and Hamblen sings it sentimentally, strolling down a twinkling memory lane and imagining his darling is again awaiting his return at the garden gate. You picture Hamblen sitting alone, probably in a darkened room, his eyes closed, wearing a dazed and goofy grin, and pretending. Especially so midway through, when Hamblen delivers a recitation that moves the song beyond mere nostalgia to fantasies of time travel: "Oh gee! Wouldn't it be great to open the door to the past? And live again? In yesterday?" He pronounces this wish in full-on Ted "Is-Everybody-Happy" Lewis mode, a stylized approach that in the day signified reverie and revelry, but that to contemporary ears leaves Hamblen sounding about half nuts. But then he starts to sing again, his sanity restored, though perhaps a little tipsy, too. Blearily, beautifully, dreamily tipsy, and crooning his heart out.

Merle heard "My Mary" countless times as a boy, and on _Pancho & Lefty_, a 1982 project with Willie Nelson, he sings it solo (Willie provides harmony, but from somewhere so far away he barely registers). Merle passes on Hamblen's recitation and lets his musicians toss back and forth the phrases of the melody instead. During the verses, he pulls even further back from Hamblen's fantasy ("living those days again") in favor of simple remembrance ("dreaming those dreams"). Those are telling edits: Haggard likes to look back at least as much as the next guy, and often a good deal more, but his brand of nostalgia is rarely escapist.

Merle's baritone retained in the early 1980s its youthful suppleness, but was deeper too and comfortably scuffed a bit by age. "My Mary" is Merle at the peak of his vocal powers. On Hamblen's song, Merle's voice is oh-so-tender as he recalls what he loves but can't regain. Yet each word also resounds with strength, and a kind of wisdom. He conveys an appreciation for the fact, a respect for it even, that while loss lingers and stings, it will ever be the necessary price for memories so sweet.

10. "New San Antonio Rose," Bing Crosby (Decca, 1941)

11. "New San Antonio Rose," Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys (Okeh, 1941)

12. "San Antonio Rose," Merle Haggard (from _The Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World_ , Capitol, 1970)

Merle cut "My Mary" near the beginning of his 1980s tenure with Columbia Records, but his vocal style, generally speaking, is the same at any career point you choose: relaxed, warm, and rugged; intensely felt, unmistakably masculine, and unabashedly Okie-accented; but smooth, too, for all that, and tending toward what we might fairly term pretty. Haggard's a crooner.

This may sound counterintuitive. The expectation is that classic country singers are nasal and exaggeratedly melismatic: hillbilly soul singers, in effect, like George Jones and his not-so-many-as-you'd-think honky-tonk descendants. Either that or they're nasal and exaggeratedly declamatory: Like Hank Williams singing "Hey, Good Lookin'," they're basically down-home, white equivalents to big-city blues shouters. And whether considered nasal note-benders or nasal shouters, country singers have been widely perceived as either cartoonishly overwrought or cartoonishly taciturn, lacking entirely in affect, energy, or corresponding intelligence.

These categories of country vocalizing do exist, broadly speaking, sort of, and thank goodness. But they wind up revealing a lot less about country music than they do about common attitudes toward it, those held by listeners outside country's core fan base in particular. For starters, the line that separates one listener's too-wrought from another's wrought-just-right is often indistinguishable, aesthetically speaking, from genre boundaries themselves. Note, too, how often and perfectly such caricatures of the music and its musicians—dumb as a rock, lazy as sin, and laughably stoic but prone to swinging on a dime to childishly sentimental or rootin'-tootin' violent—rehearse prejudices against Okies and poor white country folk generally. _Another class of people put us somewhere just below_.

The condescension here becomes more blatant when we notice that country singers have been, in the main, neither melismatic nor declamatory, but have valued instead the not-quite quiet, the straight and smooth, with intermittent note-twisting embellishments—"relaxed American," as Mazor calls it. It's not nearly so true these days as it once was, but for the bulk of its history, country music has favored a never-let-them-see-you-sweat vocal aesthetic. Its singers worked hard to make the work of singing appear like no work at all. An easy front-porch croon is the genre's default vocal mode, a norm as true for honky-tonkers, outlaws, and a fair number of bluegrassers as for singing cowboys and tuxedoed country-clubbers. Even ol' Lefty, a master of the twang-heavy vocal filigree, is at base a crooner who picks his spots for the fancy stuff and delivers his lines relaxed and smooth even then.

Another way of arriving at the same point: No singer had more influence on the development of country vocalizing than Bing Crosby. Crosby's impact is unavoidable across American popular music, of course, but his croon, comfortable and approachable and middle-class-defining, found an early home in country, and in the homes of many middle-class-aspiring country fans, the Haggards included. Asked once what records his parents had when he was young, Merle recalled that "The first thing that was a hit must have been a Crosby record."

Crosby was especially important to the western swingers and singing cowboys, those most pop-minded of country crooners who in the 1930s and '40s trailed their southwestern audiences to Hollywood and the Pacific Coast. All parties concerned sang "relaxed American," in part because they understood that, together, "relaxed" and "American" telegraphed "middle class." In return, Crosby found many of his biggest records in the country repertoire, including "New San Antonio Rose" in 1941.

"San Antonio Rose" was initially a national hit for western swing giant Bob Wills in a fiddle-driven, small-group instrumental version in 1939. It was an even bigger hit two years later when singer Tommy Duncan and other members of Wills's Texas Playboys fitted words to their boss's tune, replaced the formerly dominant fiddle with sax, clarinet, and Tex-Mex trumpets, and chugged the rhythm hard like a fast-moving train: " _New_ San Antonio Rose." Crosby covered the song by year's end, with orchestra backing from his brother Bob, who softened the beat considerably but heightened the dreamy swoon of the melody, underscoring the dreamy croon of the singer.

Haggard was a Crosby fan as a boy, but Bob Wills was a hero. "Bob Wills was all over the radio, all day," Haggard explained to one interviewer. "There was a . . . station that broadcast from Rosarita Beach in Baja, Mexico, just across the border from where my family lived in southern California. I used to catch the 7 p.m. Bob Wills show with my dad, and then listen to _The Lone Ranger_." Much later, after "Okie from Muskogee" made him into a country music superstar, Haggard chose to spend some of his new artistic capital on _The Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World_ , an album tribute to Wills and his music. It was no coincidence that Haggard's band began to be described as a swing band almost instantly. It's worth noting, however, that prior to the Wills project, western swing had barely registered as part of the Strangers' live sound or studio repertoire. The singing of Tommy Duncan, on the other hand, left its mark on Haggard much sooner. In 1955, in fact, Haggard played guitar in a pickup band behind Duncan for a sparsely attended Bakersfield solo gig.

A shorthand description of Duncan's vocal approach would be to say it was a cross between Jimmie Rodgers and Bing Crosby—American, extra relaxed—and like both of those singers, he sang, as has been said, thought by thought rather than word by word, not only emphasizing the emotions of a lyric but adding emotions the words never addressed. When Crosby sings "New San Antonio Rose," he at first takes the lyric sheet literally—it's "a broken song of love" for the Rose he's had to leave at the Alamo. But he doubles down on the loss—he elongates words with a sustained note here, a quivering mordant note there—and before long the song ceases to be about words at all. "Deep within my heart lies a melody," the song begins, and Bing sings it so the melody, and the aching beauty of Crosby's voice, is the point.

Duncan's version, by contrast, is plainspoken, unadorned, and not especially pained at all. The Playboys' rhythm bounces the singer through his lines rapidly, egged on by Wills's smiling falsetto "ah-ha"'s, and when Duncan comes to the bridge, wishing the moon would once more shine upon his lover, he's smiling big himself. Duncan's version is all about the melody, too, but as a tool for dancing on your troubles, rather than feeling them more intensely.

On 1970's _The Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World_ , Merle chooses to move the crowd with the Playboys' train-track rhythms, but after the opening, he drops the big band charts for guitar and fiddle solos nearer to the song's instrumental origins, and while his phrasing and timbre are all Duncan's, his feeling is all Crosby. "Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone," he cries—he sounds as if he might be _about_ to cry—but as the song puts it, those are "empty words." It's the melody that matters. And the held-in anguish of Merle's voice, fighting back tears and trying hard to sound relaxed.

13. "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down," The Maddox Brothers & Rose (Four Star, 1949)

14. "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down," Merle Haggard and Leona Williams (from _Heart to Heart_ , Mercury, 1983)

Country music wasn't all smooth and easy. It could get gone, too, when it had a mind, and no act better stands for the rough-and-raucous streak in California country than the Maddox Brothers & Rose. They were known as "America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band," a slogan that you'd figure had to be hyperbole—until you saw and heard them. Merle heard them on the radio all the time as a kid and loved them so much he begged his brother Lowell to take him to one of their appearances when he was twelve. This was Merle's first show, an electrified riot of volume, dim lights (and bright ones, too, blazing off the group's rhinestone-studded suits), thick smoke, and loud music presented at breakneck speed and with lascivious commentary pinballing between Maddoxes. All of this was punctuated with maniacal laughter.

The Maddoxes came to California from Alabama early in the Depression, in the vanguard of "Okie" migration. They were so far ahead of the deluge that when they hit Oakland in 1933, their plight was considered newsworthy ("Family Roams U.S. for Work"), and they got their picture in the paper. Desperately poor, the family was forced to give daughter Rose to the local postmaster for a time. As she explained it to author Nicholas Dawidoff, "They couldn't afford to feed me."

The Maddox Brothers & Rose—brothers Fred, Cliff, Don, Cal (who died in 1949), and Henry ("Friendly Henry," Cal's replacement, "The Working Girl's Friend!"), plus little sister Rose ("The Sweetheart of Hillbilly Swing")—were tailor-made for the San Joaquin Valley's newcomers. Their exaggerated stage accents and unabashed hillbilly identity, their family lineup and penchant for oldish songs (covers of Bob Wills's "Cherokee Maiden" and Jimmie Rodgers's "Mule Skinner Blues"), helped transplants keep in emotional touch with home. At the same time, the Maddoxes' fancy duds and knowing humor, their clamorous locomotive rhythms and hopped-up covers of brand-new hits, evangelized for a new home. The Maddoxes' hillbilly boogie—prototype for rockabilly and the Bakersfield Sound both—offered up hot, delirious, grab-it-while-you-can fun. And it was loud. "Nobody else turned it up as loud as they did, and [mandolin man] Henry would _really_ crank it up," Roy Nichols told Maddox biographer Jonny Whiteside. Nichols knew this firsthand. Long before joining Merle Haggard's Strangers, he played lead guitar for the Maddoxes, on record and on stage, in 1949, when he was still a teen.

The Maddoxes made a lasting impression on Merle. Nineteen seventy-one's chart-topping "Daddy Frank" was inspired, in part, by stories he had heard of the family's journeys, and his 1974 "Old Man from the Mountain," also a #1, with its hot rhythm and "Don't want no Friendly Henrys warmin' up my bed," paid tribute to their sound and randy attitude. But what really impressed Merle when he saw the band was Roy Nichols, a kid barely older than himself, on electric lead guitar.

Haggard fell into singing because he was a gifted mimic, but also, he's said with frustration, because he wasn't all that great a guitarist. As Merle grew up, the West Coast country scene was just taking shape, distinguishing itself by electric guitar licks and runs, usually played on Fender Telecasters, by a who's who of hot country pickers: Kentucky transplant Merle Travis, Joe Maphis, Speedy West, and Larry Collins (of the Collins Kids); Buck Owens, Buckaroo Don Rich, Roy Clark, and future Haggard sideman James Burton; and, later on, country rockers Roy Buchanan, Clarence White, and Roger McGuinn, among many others. In this hotbed of six-string mastery, an aspiring picker like Merle was as likely to wind up second-rate as he was to dream of guitar stardom in the first place.

Roy Nichols was as good as any of them. Born in Arizona but raised in Fresno, California, Nichols cited gypsy-jazzer Django Reinhardt as a key influence, but it was Lester "Junior" Barnard, Wills's lead guitarist during the Playboys' years on the West Coast, who became his model closest to home. Nichols worked with the Maddox Brothers & Rose for only 1949, but parlayed the experience into session work and eventually into a gig with Lefty Frizzell, both in the studio (including "California Blues" on Lefty's Rodgers tribute) and on the road as one of his Tune Toppers. In fact, Nichols was in the band in 1953 when Merle regaled the Rainbow Gardens with his Lefty routine. What was it like working for Lefty, the sixteen-year-old Merle asked the eighteen-year-old Roy. "Not worth a shit," Nichols told him. The young Nichols's playing won Merle's respect, but cocky and jaded, too? Now _that_ was the kind of musician Merle wanted to be.

You can hear a fine early example of Nichols's work on the Maddox Brothers & Rose's 1949 "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down," a single with a reputation at the time as something of a "dirty record." That was because of bawdy lyrics—"I saw Sally change her clothes/She was in a perfect pose"—and also because Sally was so game. "She loves 'em and she leaves 'em," the song says, in language anticipating a famous Haggard line to come. But if "dirty" is what you're after, check out Nichols's break at the end of the first verse. The whole record seems to slow down as the sixteen-year-old makes his guitar pant and thrust and wiggle. "Swing 'em low," yells brother Cal, and sister Rose fans herself: "Wooooo!"

Thirty years on, when Merle covered "Sally . . ." with his then-wife Leona Williams, he dropped the Maddoxes' fiddle intro and added solos on piano and pedal steel, even penny-whistle, but kept the randy, growling intensity of the Maddox version he'd loved as a boy. Halfway through he introduces a by-then fifty-year-old Roy Nichols, and his old friend proves he's still got the moves while Haggard cackles his approval.

15. "Medley," Merle Haggard & the Strangers (from _The Fightin' Side of Me_ , Capitol, 1970)

Haggard's career argues that musical indebtedness felt personally should be proclaimed publicly. Eliminate all his albums and songs intended to express gratitude and admiration for other artists, particularly artists he loved as a teenager, and you'd very nearly halve his catalogue. And even after landing a recording contract and scoring his national hits, he was still borrowing voices and sounds, still tinkering with Haggard. We can hear some of that, and what feels like a letting go of it, on 1970's live _The Fightin' Side of Me_. He tells the crowd:

We haven't been doing them on our show, but we promised we'd do them the next time we were here in Philadelphia. Would you all like to see some impersonations for a second or two?

The imitation of country stars by country hopefuls, as in Merle mimicking Lefty, is one thing. The impersonation of big stars by other big stars with already well-defined styles of their own is something else. There was a time when this was quite common in country circles, an adjunct of country comedy generally. But unlike the way an impersonator such as Rich Little might tweak, say, Richard Nixon on _The Tonight Show_ , country singers favored verisimilitude over laughs. Their takeoffs weren't so much funny as amusing and affirming, an opportunity for artist and audience to honor shared heroes. The ensuing smiles and chuckles are tingles of recognition: "Sounds just like that, don't he?" Or: "Ah hell, we got _that_ record at the house!"

"This is one of my very favorite singers," Merle avows at that 1970 Philadelphia concert. "If I don't sound like him, I'm going to be mad at me, I guarantee you." This very favorite singer turns out to be Marty Robbins, and Merle doesn't merely try to sound like Marty, he sets out to re-create Robbins's 1962 record, "Devil Woman": "If I wanted my freedom, I could be free ever more," his Mary tells him. "But I don't want to be . . ." With the Strangers' help, it's a passable job, but his next impersonation is uncanny, Merle's voice all but indistinguishable from the clipped croon of Hank Snow's 1950 hit "I'm Movin' On." Then, Merle does the Man in Black, and the bit is greeted by stomps and roars of approval—not because of the fidelity of Merle's imitation, which is sketchy at best, but because it's so game, so fond, and so identifiable as aping specifically the versions of "Folsom Prison Blues," "Jackson" (with Bonnie Owens playing June Carter), and "Orange Blossom Special" ("I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die-do") heard on Cash's wildly successful _At Folsom Prison_ from a couple of years earlier. The segment ends with Merle and the Strangers catching a lift on the freight-train sound of one of the records that first brought the Bakersfield Sound to national attention, a spot-on re-creation of Buck Owens & the Buckaroos' 1963 "Love's Gonna Live Here Again."

Impersonations like these were already quaint when Merle had performed them on a 1969 episode of _The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour_ (with Buck Owens and Johnny Cash on hand to feign annoyance). As he well knew ("We haven't been doing them on our show. . . ."), so he rushed ahead to breaking news: The Nashville Songwriters' Association had just named him Songwriter of the Year. "I'm very proud of it . . . ," he told the crowd. "And this is one of the songs that I think maybe took a little notice or something." He crooned "Today I Started Loving You Again" then, a ballad that had been recorded by some two dozen acts in just the last year and a half. It was a sign that from now on, the country singer people would be covering, and even copying, was Merle Haggard.

**"Leonard," 1981**

Many artists provided Merle Haggard with aesthetic and emotional options in the years before he'd developed those qualities in himself. Later, after he emerged as a star in his own right, a tiny group of other acts influenced him further. "Leonard," a top ten country hit at the dawn of the Reagan era, was Merle's musical raising of the glass to someone who belongs in both camps, a man who'd been inspiring him damn near his whole life—first as a local hero, then as a professional role model, and finally as a colleague and friend.

Leonard Sipes was born in Oklahoma in 1930. He followed the hordes to California in 1952, arriving just in time to witness the Bakersfield scene's national coming-out party. That was the woebegone Korean War–era hit "A Dear John Letter," which not only topped the country survey in 1953 but went Top Five on the pop charts as well. Sung with matter-of-fact cruelty by Jean Shephard and recited with it-just-figures pathos by Ferlin Husky, "Dear John" was additionally the creation of some of the very men who figured later among Merle's closest musical confidantes, several of whom were also his business partners: Ken Nelson produced it for Capitol Records, and Fuzzy Owen and Lewis Talley (who'd earlier cut the song with young "girl singer" Bonnie Owens) split the writer's credit. Fuzzy and Lewis played on the record as well, on steel and acoustic guitar, as did two more guitarists, Buck Owens and . . . Leonard Sipes, though by then he was going by an intoxicating nom de plume Husky had suggested: Tommy Collins.

The early Bakersfield scene was small and more or less selfcontained, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't help to have a scorecard. Bonnie Owens (with an "s," maiden name Campbell) had once been married to Buck Owens (also with an "s," real name Alvis), but wasn't married anymore when she moved to California and began to date Fuzzy Owen (no "s," real name Charles). Per Bear Family, "A Dear John Letter" was first recorded in 1953 for the Mar-Vel label and credited to "Fuzzy and Bonnie Owens" (with an "s" for both; it was just easier). Writer Gerald Haslam reports that "Dear John" was actually written by Bakersfield's Johnny Grimes (stage name Hillbilly Barton). However, before the song became a hit for Jean Shepherd (real name Ollie) and Ferlin Husky (his real name, believe it or not, though he'd briefly used the stage name Terry Preston and would one day record comedy sides as Simon Crum), Grimes traded the song to the apparently nickname-deprived Lewis Talley in exchange for either a scooter or, depending on who's telling the tale, a "Kaiser automobile." Talley, in turn, sold half the copyright to Fuzzy Owen for 150 bucks. Fuzzy played steel guitar in the Orange Blossom Playboys, the Blackboard house band run by Bill Woods, aka "The Father of the Bakersfield Sound," who at various points had also employed Buck Owens, Merle Haggard, and Red Simpson (real name Joe), aka Suitcase Simpson because of the satchel of songs for sale he always carried. (In 1972, Merle recorded a Simpsonpenned tribute number called "Bill Woods from Bakersfield.") The studio lineup for Shepherd and Husky's "Dear John" session was rounded out by bassist Herman Snyder (stage name Herman the Hermit), whose son Clifford Snyder (stage name Cliffie Stone) was the longtime host of _Hometown Jamboree_ , a Los Angeles–based TV show that regularly featured Leonard Sipes, aka Tommy Collins, and was a regular as well on another seminal television show, Bakersfield's own _Cousin Herb Henson's Trading Post_. Wikipedia claims that host Cousin Herb (real name Herbert Henson) was the first cousin once removed of alt.country band Wilco's frontperson, Jeff Tweedy (real name Jeff Tweedy).

Collins joined the hit parade himself soon afterward, landing a #2 hit with his own "You Better Not Do That" and succeeding it with the likeminded #4 hit "Whatcha Gonna Do Now," both in 1954. The very year, in other words, in which Merle's impromptu opening gig for Lefty Frizzell had him deciding he wanted to play music for a living was also the year that jukebox-crowding Tommy Collins offered hometown proof it could be done. For a time, Collins continued to pen hits for himself and others: "Untied" and "It Tickles," which like "Whatcha Gonna Do Now" featured hot hillbilly licks by Buck Owens, went top ten for Collins in 1955. That same year his "If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')" was a big record for Capitol label mate Faron Young.

But Collins had a religious conversion the following year. By decade's end, he'd attended a seminary, pastored several congregations, and, finally, set aside professional music altogether. By the time Merle was out of prison, though, Collins was trying to get back in the game, and after catching Merle's "Sing a Sad Song" on the radio, he tracked down the young singer. This had to be a big deal for Merle—at that very moment the nation's best-selling country album was the debt-repaying Buck Owens's _Sings Tommy Collins_. Soon Haggard and Collins were taking regular fishing trips along the Kern, the older man helping out the ambitious young ex-con with his songwriting and musicianship and just being generally supportive in ways Merle needed. As he put it in "Leonard," Collins "even brought around a bag of groceries (Hey!)/Back before Muskogee came along."

At first glance, the two seem a poor match. Haggard, even early on, was a notably smooth crooner, down-to-earth but with a soaring and wide vocal range, whereas Collins sang with a self-consciously rural accent, high and pinched thin. What's more, while Haggard's best known today for material that marks him as about as earnest a singer-songwriter as you'll find, Collins leaned wacky. His specialty was the G-rated wink at R-rated activity, for which "You Better Not Do That" was the model: There, Collins tells his pawing and petting girlfriend that she'd better stop her pawing and petting, PDQ, the never-stated but always obvious reason being that if she doesn't, he is, at the very least, going to be sporting a big ol' boner—and then what'll they do? The subsequent "Whatcha Gonna Do Now" ("Then I saw a gleam that I never saw before!") and "It Tickles" (That's what she said . . .) were variations on the theme. So was "Sam Hill," in which the title character heads up the mountain to see his sweetheart for years on end, returning home each evening with a smile on his face: The townsfolk wonder "What the Sam Hill's goin' on," but we know. In 1964, that Collins novelty would provide Merle with a minor follow-up hit to his career-launching "Sing a Sad Song."

But Merle and Tommy were an odd couple only at first glance. Behind the grin, Collins was an adept interpreter of seriously mournful balladry. Country just doesn't come much more completely licked by circumstance than his "I Wish I Had Died in My Cradle," or more betrayed and righteously pissed than his "High on a Hilltop." These titles are much nearer in style and sentiment to the more than a dozen Collins numbers Haggard would later record—the cynical and game-playing "Carolyn," for instance, or "Wine Take Me Away," which they wrote together. Including that cowrite (and one more, "My Hands Are Tied," which the pair wrote with fellow Capitol artist Kay "Little Pink Mac" Adams), Merle has cut eighteen Collins songs in his career. When asked by _Rolling Stone_ in 2011 to list ten songs he wished he'd written, Merle chose a series of classics by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers and Lefty Frizzell, Tom T. Hall, Kris Kristofferson, Hank Williams, and others, but he saved the #10 spot for Collins's "When No Flowers Grow." It's "about a woman who accidentally kills her child by backing over him. She goes crazy, picking flowers in the snow, when no flowers grow," Haggard explains, noting "It's an expert piece of work."

Returning the autobiographical assist Collins had earlier given Haggard in songs like "The Roots of My Raising" and "I Made the Prison Band," Merle's own "Leonard" allowed him to sing his friend's story with reverence and good humor and a keen sense of how hard a world it is: Sipes nearly became a star ("Hey, once he even followed Elvis Presley!"); he gave it all up to preach the gospel before figuring out that wasn't his calling after all ("How in the hell was Leonard supposed to know?"); he lost his wife and kids to addiction and the road ("I saw what pills and booze can really do"); and then he got himself back on track after all ("I'd forgot about a Friend that Leonard knew")—all of this, and more, in a mere three dozen lines. It's an expert piece of work.

**The Bakersfield Sound and Fury**

Merle Haggard walked out of San Quentin on November 3, 1960, and caught a bus back home to Bakersfield. His wife hadn't met him at the prison gates as planned, but the couple had already decided to give their marriage another try. With a wife and growing family to feed, Merle had no time to ease into his liberty. He signed on at his brother's electrical contracting business, digging ditches and doing other odd jobs for a solid eighty a week.

Bakersfield in 1960 was a very different place from the one Merle's folks emigrated to in 1935 and where he'd been born in '37. Haggard noted some more recent changes on 1972's _Let Me Tell You about a Song_ during a spoken introduction to "They're Tearing the Labor Camps Down." "The freeways were wider and the old steam engines were gone forever," he observed. Women wore their dresses shorter, too, he smiled, though perhaps it just seemed that way to a man who'd been in stir for three years.

"One thing I noticed most of all down through the San Joaquin Valley," he continued, "was the disappearance of so many labor camps where once I'd lived from time to time myself." It set Merle to worrying about the migrant workers, the men "with the big family who can't afford the old high standard of living," who still followed the harvest and needed places to live. An ongoing problem, as it's turned out, though one increasingly less pressing for Okies than for black and Hispanic laborers.

That was because of another development. The coming of the Okies created much nativist hostility through the Great Depression and World War II, but it also put the little oil town on the map. Thirty years down the road, the Okies were more and more identified, by their former tormentors and by themselves, as assimilated middle-class-aspiring Californians—and many of them had the mortgages and lawn mowers to prove it. A related development, many Okies defended their rising standards of living and tenuous new status by putting a boot on the throats of those who'd never shared even their limited privileges to begin with. In 1964, Californians would vote two-to-one in favor of Proposition 14, repealing the state's open housing law and making it legal for property owners to reject prospective renters or home buyers on the basis of race. Two years later, two thousand black Bakersfieldians protested the city's failure to distribute federal poverty funds by setting fire to a school bus. Local whites reacted, first, with a Molotov cocktail assault on black neighborhoods and, second, by passing an initiative to refuse any future federal poverty assistance. One way Okies signaled to themselves and the world they'd arrived, relatively speaking, was to purchase tract homes in southern California's "crabgrass frontier" and to fill them with shiny new appliances. A way for Okies to defend their toehold in that world was to inflict class- and race-based wounds similar to the ones they still nursed themselves.

It's been said that California's conservative turn in the 1960s, soon taken nationwide by the likes of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, should be blamed on the arrival of the Okies and their conservative worldviews, a new political reality—the southern-ization of America, Golden State division—exploited by Republican southern strategies ever since. Historian Peter La Chapelle shows that the catalyst for the shift was at least as much the other way around, "the southern California-ization of . . . transplanted southerners" working overtime to achieve the American Dream and the respectability that proved it had come true. With good prospects and a little luck, they could maybe even contemplate a level of success that would let them become Republicans, of all things, albeit ones without country club memberships.

These new attitudes, reinforced by new subdivisions and strip malls, new security and political clout, were forward-looking but tentatively so and tetchy. Any optimism was mitigated by its opposite being only a few missed paychecks away. The mood was bright-eyed but vigilant and with a giant chip on its shoulder. "I'm proud to be an Okie," Merle would sing in 1969, only months after recalling in "Hungry Eyes" how "another class of people put us somewhere just below." All through the golden age of the Bakersfield Sound is a pride in collective roots that's inseparable, indistinguishable really, from an anxiety that the Okies could still be sent, if only metaphorically, back where they came from.

These are the decades when Okie references in band names and song titles all but disappear from the rollicking Bakersfield scene and when the trade category "Hillbilly" was replaced by Country & Western in evocation of the tonier Town & Country. Those rhinestone-bejeweled western suits, designed by L.A.-based tailor Nudie Cohn, so closely identified with Buck Owens and other 1960s country acts, are a neon-bright symbol of economic apprehension. A Nudie suit is both a salt-of-the-earth signifier of hillbilly style and a flashy advertisement for upward mobility.

Merle had dabbled at becoming a professional musician before he went to prison. He played some around town through his teens and appeared, once, on TV's _The Billy Mize Show_ , singing Lefty's "King without a Queen." In 1956, he even relocated to the Ozarks to work on _The Smilin' Jack Tyree Radio Show_ in Springfield, Missouri, but came home a month later. Now, though, inspired by Cash's San Quentin concert and newly confident in his abilities, he set to scrounging for pickup gigs in earnest.

His first break came a few months after release when a visitor showed up at Merle's house, needing a singer for his band and wanting to hear if Haggard was as good as recommended. Merle had just recorded himself singing Jimmie Rodgers's "Nobody Knows but Me" on a borrowed Webcore reel-to-reel and offered to play it for the fellow. After some initial disbelief ("That's not you," the guy replies in _House of Memories_. "That's Lefty Frizzell."), Merle was tapped to sing lead and play rhythm guitar four nights a week at a club called the High Pockets. Things moved quickly from there. He entered a talent contest at the Rainbow Gardens, singing "Smoking Cigarettes and Drinkin' Coffee Blues," a Marty Robbins–penned Lefty Frizzell hit from the year before. He came in second, but the exposure helped win him a job spelling singer Johnny Barnett nights at the Lucky Spot. Before he knew it, Merle was working six or seven nights a week and quit working days for his brother. All of this was in 1961.

Sometime in '62, Haggard recorded his first single. The steel guitarist at the Lucky Spot was named Fuzzy Owen, an Arkie transplant, Bakersfield club fixture, and a regular on Cousin Herb Henson's television program. The more Fuzzy heard Merle, the more excited he became. The two struck up a friendship and soon decided to cut some sides on Merle for release on Tally Records, the label Owen had cofounded with, and recently bought outright from, his cousin Lewis Talley. For the A-side, they picked one of Merle's songs, "Skid Row," and the B was Owen's "Singin' My Heart Out." The latter was like a thousand other Nashville Sound–sounding records of the moment—tinkling slip-note piano, female chorus, smooth Marty Robbins vocal—but "Skid Row" was another matter. It's kicked off by electric guitar that's thick and twisty like taffy, like the lick from George Jones's "Tall, Tall Trees" played in quicksand. The song's about a guy who's fallen on harder-than-hard times, a common-enough theme for country music. What makes it a standout is Merle's tart, pointed vocal and its unexpectedly mature lyric. His girl tells Merle she's leaving because he's "got _no class_ ," and in a song he's said he wrote when he was just fourteen, maybe fifteen, Merle's voice lets us know he agrees with her. Merle's so rock-bottom that when people pass on the street, "they stop and stare." Then he cops to a humiliation many Okies would recall all too well: "They giggle and snicker at the clothes I wear."

Haggard now had earned enough of a reputation that Buck Owens hired him to play bass. Haggard only lasted a few months with Owens on the road—in Milwaukee, he got a standing "O" singing George Jones's new hit, "She Thinks I Still Care"—but stuck around long enough to dub Buck's band the Buckaroos. (The Buckaroos repaid this debt with the release in 1971 of an instrumental album entitled _The Songs of Merle Haggard_.)

Buck Owens's emergence as country music's brightest young star was the most consequential change to the Bakersfield scene of all. Buck had been a familiar face in area clubs well before Merle jimmied Fred & Gene's back door, and Capitol Records producer Ken Nelson had A-listed Owens for studio work, as well: Buck played hot-dog guitar on rockabilly-influenced sessions for Gene Vincent, Wanda Jackson, and Tommy Collins. But Owens didn't hit with a cut of his own until Spring 1959, about a year into Merle's sentence, when "Second Fiddle" registered briefly on the charts. He solidified that minor success with a trio of major ones—"Under Your Spell Again," "Above and Beyond," and "Excuse Me (I Think I've Got a Heartache)"—before Merle was released the following year. Owens was on his way to becoming a hometown star so big that locals began referring to "Buckersfield."

An eight-year-old Owens and his parents had headed to California from Texas in 1937, the year Haggard was born, but their car lasted only to Arizona, adding a decade-and-a-halflayover to Buck's itinerary. The Owenses spent years in desperate poverty in Arizona, working when they could get work in fruit and vegetable fields they didn't own. Buck played music for fun and extra cash and eventually married the girl singer in one of his first bands, a swingy little string band known by the selfconsciously rural moniker, the Skillet Lickers. Buck and Bonnie Owens had two children in Arizona, but they were on the outs when Bonnie took the kids to Bakersfield early in 1951 and legally separated by the time Buck moved there in May.

It's fun to imagine Buck and Merle passing one another out there on the road somewhere that spring—Buck twenty-one and Bakersfield-bound, Merle barely a teenager and road-tripping to Texas. In many ways, the two men most identified with the Bakersfield Sound were always moving in different directions. Buck Owens was a savvy music entrepreneur who would eventually make millions in publishing and radio while Merle was indifferent to money matters and ended up declaring bankruptcy in the 1990s. They were musically very different, too. Merle was born with a technically great voice, with broad range and arresting texture, and he sings with deep nuance, variety, and emotional presence. Buck was a highly effective singer, as well, but more limited. He had two speeds, so to speak. One was effervescent and bubbly, which was good because Buck liked effervescent, bubbly songs: "My Heart Skips a Beat," "Love's Gonna Live Here," "We're Gonna Let the Good Times Roll," and so on.

Buck's other speed was a plaintive solemnity he adopted for ballads. Typically, Owens sang "Together Again" in 1964 pretty much the same way he sang "Crying Time" the year after, even though the former ballad is presumably happy and the latter very unhappy indeed. He sings both songs pleasantly, agreeably, his aim to entertain, not to challenge. Always, Owens sings with a palpable sense of wanting to be liked.

That's another difference between Buck and Merle, who himself wants to be liked as much as anyone, but who goes about it by stressing how much he doesn't give a damn what you think. In 1969, in "Workin' Man Blues," for instance, a prickly Merle took a stand and bragged he'd never been on welfare, but when Buck acknowledged the same issue in "Waitin' in Your Welfare Line," a chart-topper in the months prior to passage of Bakersfield's antiwelfare initiative, he makes it a sweetly shuffling joke. Haggard, who as a boy experienced similar if not nearly so desperate deprivation as Owens had in Arizona, grew up to write introspective, angry songs about what it's like to be poor. Owens was about getting up and out. "Act Naturally," "Johnny B. Goode," "Above and Beyond," "Big in Vegas"—the songs Buck Owens wrote and sang are about class, too, but from the perspective of a poor man who wants desperately to be rich. These differences between Haggard and Owens mirror the conflicted emotions of white working-class communities generally. Merle Haggard wore his carefully guarded outsider status like a scab. Buck Owens wanted to belong.

Haggard's first single for Tally sold out, but as Fuzzy Owen printed only two hundred copies, and sold those mostly off the stage and out of his trunk, that wasn't saying much. Merle wanted to record again, but Owen kept putting him off, saying the songs Merle was writing were fine but not hits. Bring me a song that we can make some money on, Fuzzy kept saying. Merle kept writing and kept looking.

Merle visited Las Vegas around then, stopping in at the Nashville Nevada Club, home base for another important Bakersfield figure, Wynn Stewart. Stewart came to California from Missouri in the late 1940s, and by the time Merle visited Vegas had one honest-to-goodness hit, a haunting, fiddle-driven shuffle called "Wishful Thinking" in 1959, and a string of middling ones just as strong, including most recently two inestimable boot scooters: "Big, Big Love" and "Another Day, Another Dollar" paired Wynn's pinched tenor with searing electric licks from pedal steel pioneer Ralph Mooney and Merle's childhood guitar hero, Roy Nichols.

Merle says Nichols spotted him right off that night, enlisting him to play guitar for a few numbers so Roy could hit the bathroom. "Can you sing?" Mooney wanted to know, and when Merle said sure, they ran through a series of Marty Robbins hits, ending with "Devil Woman," a song that, as Merle explained to Colin Escott, "You won't hear too many guys singing because it's got a high note in there that will embarrass you if you don't hit it." As the song ended, Merle noticed Stewart was listening from in front of the bandstand, impressed.

Stewart's West Coast Playboys were one of the best country bands on the planet. Mooney (cowriter of Ray Price's "Crazy Arms" and later the main man in Waylon Jennings's the Waylors) and Nichols were two of the finest soloists in the business; Bobby Austin, who'd just informed Stewart he was planning to leave, played bass; and Helen "Peaches" Price was the "lady drummer"—a lineup that foretold Merle's fortune twice over: First, because Stewart hired Merle on the spot as Austin's replacement and, second, because within the year it became the core of his own studio band.

Merle moved his family (now including daughter Kelli, his and Leona's third child) to Vegas, but though his Lefty and Marty impersonations were well received, he stayed there only about six months. That was because of "Sing a Sad Song," a swooning, heartbroken ballad his boss finished at the bar one night between sets and introduced to the band just as they went back on. Merle sensed right away that the song Stewart had in mind for a next single was the song he and Fuzzy were searching for. It took him a few days to gin up his courage, but Merle finally approached Stewart with what he had in mind. "Wynn," he asked, "if it was in your power to make me a star, would you do it?" Of course he would, Stewart said. "It _is_ within your power," Merle replied. "Give me that song you wrote. Let me record it." Stewart agreed, and Merle walked straight to a pay phone, called Fuzzy, and told him to schedule a session. "We got the song."

For nearly as long as there has been something called "the Bakersfield Sound," it's been contrasted with what people have in mind when they refer to "the Nashville Sound." The former is described with words like "raw" and "real," "traditional" and "twangy," while the latter's deemed "over-produced" and "fake," "poppy" (a bad thing, in this context) and "twang-less" or, twang's presumed opposite, "smooth." In sociologist Richard Peterson's spot-on categorizing, it's "hardcore" versus "soft-shell."

Now, in the 1950s and '60s, Bakersfield did possess a much rowdier music culture, typified by what Tommy Collins once described as the "redneck, scared-to-death, honky-tonk, skull orchard, barely-making-a-living places of Okie entertainment." Bakersfield prized the big beats of western swing and boogie woogie, and it embraced the loud guitars and even louder rhythms of rockabilly, too, and of rock 'n' roll generally. Just like Joe Maphis's hit said, it was "Dim Lights, Thick Smoke and Loud, Loud Music." Bakersfield was Get Up and Dance whereas Nashville, at least as exemplified by the Grand Ole Opry, leaned toward Sit and Clap. Buck Owens, who set loose Buckaroo Don Rich's fiddle on classic Harlan Howard shuffles but traded it in for Rich's Telecaster when covering Chuck Berry, is the exemplary figure.

All true, but all exaggerated. Company town Music City and upstart Bakersfield were never as far apart sonically as either's patrons have been willing to allow. It's not that Nashville was less receptive to rock 'n' roll than Bakersfield, but that it was receptive to different types of rock 'n' roll. Per Charlie Gillett's "Five Styles of Rock 'n' Roll," Bakersfield favored "the Chicago rhythm & blues style of Chuck Berry" and "the Northern band rock 'n' roll" of western-swing fiend Billy Haley & His Comets, while Nashville was into "the New Orleans dance blues style," particularly the rock and _roll_ of Fats Domino (and the bluesy croon of Ivory Joe Hunter across the Gulf) and the ballad-loving "vocal group style" most of all. The two camps will just have to agree to share the Memphis-centered rockabilly Gillett called "country rock."

What's more, as Bakersfield came into its own in the early-to-mid-1960s (it should be noted that Bakersfield had the clubs and much of the talent, but the hit-making happened almost exclusively in L.A.), fans of sharp electric leads and hotshot picking would've found more twang-centric hits coming out of Nashville than what was sometimes dubbed Nashville West. Buck Owens had his first two national #1's, "Act Naturally" and "Love's Gonna Live Here," in 1963. But look what Nashville put out that same year and the year before: Porter Wagoner's "Misery Loves Company," George Jones's "She Thinks I Still Care," Carl Butler & Pearl's "Don't Let Me Cross Over," Marty Robbins's "Ruby Ann," Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire"—and those are just the #1's, each of which swings or rocks as hard as, is as twangy or traditional or raw, and in some cases a good deal more so, than Buck's hits. Not to deny that Nashville was just then making a lot more of the country pop stuff, too. Nashville made a lot more of everything.

Bakersfield was more diverse than its reputation, as well, and Merle Haggard's "Sing a Sad Song," a small national hit, his first, in 1964, stands as Exhibit A. Merle, Fuzzy, and Stewart's Playboys met in Hollywood for the session, and the result was a Nashville Sound–ing masterpiece. Appropriately so, as Stewart's lyric alludes to "The End of the World," Skeeter Davis's lush-and-then-some Nashville pop smash from the year before. "Pretend it's the end of the world," Merle pleads, alone in some bar, playing the jukebox and trying to forget the woman who's told him off. "She's unhappy with me," he confesses. Then, with sheepish understatement: "She told me so." The song's heavy acoustic strum and Price's relentlessly simple beat weigh upon Merle—you imagine his head bobbing as he fights the whiskey for consciousness—and then with great force of will his voice skies, riding the melody to a self-involved falsetto. Strings drip off the track like grease down the walls of an old diner, and when Ralph Mooney plays the melody on pedal steel, the strings play along until it sounds like Mooney is playing a thousand steel guitars, like the orchestra's been electrified, and like the world as Merle's known it really is coming to an end.

In September 1963, when "Sing a Sad Song" was earning local airplay but had yet to crack the national charts, Cousin Herb Henson celebrated the tenth anniversary of his _Trading Post_ program with a concert recording for Capitol Records. _Country Music Hootenanny_ is like a time capsule of the new Bakersfield. Owens and the Buckaroos race through their soon-to-be chart-topper "Act Naturally." Tommy Collins hams it up through appropriate-to-the-occasion novelty "I Got Mine," and the evening also includes performances by Bakersfield stalwarts Jean Shepherd and Buddy Cagle, among others, plus a very young and very pop Glen Campbell. Roy Nichols is there, too, fronting the _Trading Post_ band. His furious rock 'n' roll guitar on Rose Maddox's "Down to the River" is a model of controlled, real-real-gone aggression.

Maddox, and her brother Cal, "the laughing cowboy," who joined her in the performance, were still-thriving remnants of the audience's Okie past at its over-the-top hillbilly-est. When Cousin Herb presented the colorful pair, though, he made a point of guaranteeing they would "be big city all the way!" That tension between newfound community self-esteem and small-town inferiority was present all night. "Welcome to the beautiful new civic auditorium in Bakersfield, California," Henson gushed, "one hundred miles north of Los Angeles. _We have our own airport, thank you very much_."

Merle was at the show that night, watching from the wings. When Ken Nelson, up from Hollywood to record the show, spotted the singer, he buttonholed Haggard, telling him what a fine record "Sing a Sad Song" was and counseling him to leave Tally for Capitol, where he'd get the promotion he needed. Perhaps, to put a point on that argument, he let slip plans to record the song with Capitol artist Buddy Cagle. Merle thought about it, then told Nelson thanks but no thank you. Fuzzy had done right by him and was a friend to boot. He was going to try to make it, and to stay put.

**Someone Told His Story in a Song**

"Sing a Sad Song" hinted at possible big things to come for Haggard, just barely, charting a measly three weeks and reaching only #19. Perhaps it would've managed a bit better if it hadn't competed for airplay against that Buddy Cagle single, but even with a distributional and promotional disadvantage of David versus Goliath proportions, Merle's "Sing a Sad Song" bested Cagle's Capitol release, which couldn't crack the top 25. Still, competition from major labels was always going to be an existential problem for tiny, cash-poor labels like Tally. If Owen and Haggard hadn't known that going in, they learned it for sure when Merle's "Sam Hill," the silly Tommy Collins number that was Merle's follow-up to "Sing a Sad Song," couldn't breach the country top 40 even as a version from Columbia artist Claude King peaked at #11. Then again, King's Nashville version was more driving and electric, more Bakersfieldy, and at the same time more understated, than Merle's more broadly comic, novelty- _sounding_ rendition. "Sam Hill" did well enough, though, that Merle quit Stewart and returned to Bakersfield.

Merle brought his songs to Fuzzy all the time in these early years, and Fuzzy, now his manager, steadily turned them down. The two spent a lot of time talking about songwriting, and Fuzzy liked to comb the pages of _Billboard_ or _Cashbox_ , pointing out trends and explaining to his pupil why hits were hits and why Merle's songs weren't. Haggard would listen closely and try again. Is _this_ song any good, Merle asked, and Fuzzy would allow that, yeah, it's a pretty good song. When Merle pushed, though, wondering if the song was good enough to be a _hit_ , Fuzzy delivered the same deflating reply: "Naaaaw." Merle kept writing, and kept looking.

Liz Anderson was living in North Dakota when she and husband Casey, and four-year-old daughter (and future country-pop star) Lynn, moved to California in 1951, settling around Sacramento. That's where she started writing country songs, because, as she told historians Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann, there weren't any country radio stations around and she missed the music. "I just started writing," she explained, "so I'd have some to sing to myself." By the early 1960s, she was getting some of those songs recorded. Del Reeves took her "Be Quiet Mind," one of those hard country records Nashville wasn't supposed to make, top ten in 1961, and the not-hard-at-all Roy Drusky scored a hit in '64 with Anderson's "Pick of the Week."

Haggard and Anderson were introduced to one another at a gig outside Sacramento by Bonnie Owens, the ex–Mrs. Buck Owens and Fuzzy's longtime girlfriend who'd herself recently cut Anderson's "Lie a Little" for Tally. Merle "kind of turned his back on the audience," Anderson recalled when I spoke to her in 2011. "He was a little mad no one was there. But when he sang, we flipped out!" Casey Anderson invited Bonnie and Merle back to the house after the show, offering to cook breakfast if they'd check out some of his wife's songs. "I was set to be bored to death," Merle writes in _Sing Me Back Home_ , "especially when she went over to an old pump organ." To his amazement, though, Anderson proceeded to play, by his estimation, "one hit after another." Merle and Bonnie would eventually record as duets several songs Anderson shared that night, most notably "Just between the Two of Us." But it was a song called "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers" that grabbed Merle by the collar. "He had it learned on the guitar before he left the house," Anderson said.

Today, "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers" sounds like a Merle Haggard record to a degree his earlier singles don't. Merle seems relaxed, sings in a slightly lower register, and sounds earthier, too. His voice sounds haggard like it hadn't before, but not so much that it rejects polish, embellishment, or other nice things like the ooh-ing female chorus seconding his emotions. The music shares this rough beauty. Roy Nichols's fancy acoustic guitar lines keep snagging on his jagged barbed-wire chords, and his fellow West Coast Playboys play gritty and pretty by turns.

His woman has left him, Merle sings, after promising she'd stay with him forever. Hardly a new story, but Liz Anderson's lyric conveys those age-old feelings of betrayal and loss with special bitterness. "It sure turned out to be a short forever," Merle deadpans on the way to making a promise of his own. From here on out, he's never going to trust anyone, ever: "All my friends are gonna be strangers." He means it. At the same time, Merle makes plain that he doesn't mean it, his confident tone covering unmistakably for intense self-loathing borne of who knows how many other humiliations. What had he been thinking? He knew she was bad news, should have seen her treachery coming and be relieved she's gone. But, oh, what he wouldn't be willing to do if she would only come back . . .

"Strangers" came out on Tally late in 1964, and it was immediately clear that the new record wouldn't merely hint at something big as "Sing a Sad Song" had done. "Strangers" _was_ big, a top ten hit for Merle in the first part of '65. Even so, the old problem of the big label stealing the little label's thunder remained. In a detail mostly forgotten today, the artist who had the really big record that year with "Strangers" was Roy Drusky, the deep-voiced Mercury Records crooner who had a concurrent #6 hit with the song. Ken Nelson saw his chance and approached Merle again about signing to Capitol: You'll never realize your potential on such a small label. This time Haggard saw his own chance and agreed, though not before ensuring Fuzzy Owen would continue to produce his records in cooperation with Nelson.

The switch to Capitol is a big reason why it's Haggard's version of Anderson's song we know so well today, not Drusky's. Moving to Capitol allowed Haggard to release more and better-sounding records, to reach a wider audience, and to have a career that would eventually include not only one hit after another but theme albums and double albums and tributes—and, taking the long view, catalogue reissues and best-of collections, quite a few of them including "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers." Then again, there's the little matter of Haggard's version of "Strangers" simply being more arresting than Drusky's. When Drusky tells us he "should be taken out and tarred and feathered" for his foolishness, we take him as self-effacing. When Haggard sings the line, it's as if he's identifying exactly the punishment he deserves.

_Strangers_ , Haggard's album debut, arrived late in 1965. It joined his early singles—including the follow-up to "Strangers," the joyously embittered but commercially unsuccessful Merle original "I'm Gonna Break Every Heart I Can"—with a few new Capitol recordings and a couple of Tally leftovers. It was a remarkable debut in many ways, in the consistently high emotional intelligence of Haggard's vocals most of all. But _Strangers_ is also very much of a piece with most country music in the middle Sixties.

For starters, and in contrast to his and his scene's hardcore mythology, _Strangers_ is more than anything else a pretty swell Nashville Sound album. Five of the album's dozen tracks are sweetened by strings (bittersweetened, actually); supperclub piano is prominent throughout; and Roy Nichols's acoustic picking cops regularly from Music City hits by Hank Snow and Marty Robbins. Merle borrows a good deal himself: He's doing Robbins on a cover of the early 1950s Eddy Arnold hit "I'd Trade All of My Tomorrows," doing him again on the chorus to Liz Anderson's "The Worst Is Yet to Come," and yet again throughout one of his own songs, the peevish and accusing "You Don't Even Try." On his less peevish but more accusing "If I'd Left It Up to You," he channels Wynn Stewart.

Like almost any country album of the period, _Strangers_ is topped off with covers—Merle's go at Ernest Tubb's "Walking the Floor over You" paces about its room with considerable agitation. But at this point in his career, even Merle's originals draw heavily upon other styles and songs. His "Hey Mr. D. J.," for example, follows in the path of recent disc-jockey-themed hits like Stonewall Jackson's "B.J. the D.J." and Jimmy C. Newman's "D.J. for a Day"—proof, perhaps, that Merle had been taking notes when Fuzzy was picking winners in _Billboard_. It's a clever touch when Merle slips a request for his own first hit into each chorus of "Hey Mr. D. J.": "Play me that _song of sadness_ , and I'll be grateful to you, sir!"

Haggard didn't come off as a particularly distinctive artist on _Strangers_ , but his derivativeness was of a high and promising quality. Merle's second solo album, _Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down_ , released almost exactly a year later on its way to becoming Merle's first chart-topping LP and credited for the first time to "Merle Haggard and the Strangers," is no less derivative, but is less memorable. Excepting, of course, the pair of drinking songs that provide the album with its title: Each had been a Top Five single in 1966, elevating Merle's profile from Rising Star to Consistent Hit Maker. They were firstrate Haggard originals, to boot, with melodies and sentiments even now proving timeless. Right in line with several recent making-the-most-of-nothing tavern hits from Porter Wagoner ("Misery Loves Company," "Sorrow on the Rocks," "I'll Go Down Swinging"), "Swinging Doors" finds Merle planted at the bar, crowing the virtues of his limits. "I got swinging doors, a jukebox and a bar stool," he shouts as Ralph Mooney's pedal steel flashes bright and dark like the neon out front. What more could a loser ask for? At least until they kick him out come closing time?

That's where "The Bottle Let Me Down" picks up the story. "Each night I leave the barroom when it's over," Merle moans like he's just pulled another drunken double shift. Mooney kicks it off, out of his head, and studio ace James Burton, making his first appearance on a Haggard session, slaps the singer to his senses with lacerating Telecaster. Then Merle tells us that all those bottles have betrayed his faith and let him remember the woman who busted his heart. The bottle, his "one true friend," has turned out to be as untrustworthy as any other stranger.

These numbers stare as deeply into their respective shot glasses as almost any country drinking songs out there. And both "I Can't Stand Me," where Burton's revved-up guitar chases after a self-hating Merle ("I gotta get away from myself!"), and Merle's haunting rendition of Tommy Collins's imperious "High on a Hilltop" are nearly as powerful. But the rest of the album is rote. The songs, all but two by Merle, are solid and competent, and so are the arrangements and performances, but at this remove, if they didn't happen to be by Merle Haggard, no one would care. On "I'll Look over You" Merle is Marty once again, while "This Town's Not Big Enough" isn't up to Liz Anderson's songwriting best. The joke songs don't work either. "Shade Tree Fix-It Man" scoots along nicely, but as a comedian Merle makes a great straight man, and (a low point in his catalogue) "The Girl Turned Ripe [when the pickers came today]" is just creepy.

Liz Anderson's greatest song, and certainly her greatest contribution to the Merle Haggard story, was a song she wrote with her husband, Casey—and its genesis lay in that staple of Sixties American culture, prime-time television. One of the most popular shows in the nation in the winter of 1965–1966 was _The Fugitive_ , starring David Jansen as Richard Kimble, on the run and trying to prove he hadn't murdered his wife. Casey kept suggesting to Liz that she should write a song about it, but she couldn't think of an idea she liked. During a car trip from Nashville back home to Sacramento, though, the Andersons read a Montana historical marker describing an Indian tribe whose chief crop had been children. Or so it seemed to the area's white settlers, who prayed, the sign explained, that "their crops would fail." Liz had a brainstorm then—the song's centerpiece line, "I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days while Mama used to pray my crops would fail." By the time the Andersons stopped in Nevada for breakfast, they'd written "The Fugitive."

Liz Anderson would cut a version of the song herself the following year, including it on an album of her own songs entitled _Cookin' Up the Hits_. What was the recipe for "The Fugitive"? Start with the television show, then add that roadside inspiration. Emphasize the show's episodic weekly structure ("Down every road there's always one more city . . .") and mix in some imagined empathy born of the Andersons' own cross-country drive. Toss in a line recalled from Rudyard Kipling ("He who travels fastest goes [ _sic_ ] alone . . .") and pour in a touch of the zeitgeist too: Is "a fugitive must be a rolling stone" alluding to the Dylan hit from the summer before or the British rock band first topping the charts at the same time?

When they presented the song to Merle, the Andersons had no idea he'd ever been in prison or spent his teenage years fleeing law enforcement. But Merle felt a connection to the song immediately, and it set him to thinking how he might harvest life experience for songs of his own. He took his first stab at "The Fugitive" in the studio that March, recording a clip-clopping-'round-the-campfire take that's pretty and delicate and has lots of harmonica and backing singers. Merle, Ken Nelson, and Fuzzy Owen decided to come back to it later. When Merle next visited Capitol in June, he brought along a new song he'd written, "Someone Told My Story in a Song," that sounds inspired by the experience of hearing the Andersons' "Fugitive." "I scarcely could believe the song I heard . . . ," Merle gasps, in reply to a new record just played on the jukebox. "It was almost like I'd written every word."

A couple of months later, Merle and company took another crack at "The Fugitive," now identified as "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," and got the hounded take we know today. The drums feel insistent but stationary, locked in, as Glen Campbell's acoustic guitar tumbles aimlessly on. Merle sounds world-weary and increasingly out of breath—"I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways: outrun the law or spend my life in jail"—and James Burton offers a short, sharp Telecaster run that screams like a siren. In the spring, "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive" became Haggard's first #1 single.

With "Strangers" and "Fugitive," Liz Anderson had helped teach Haggard how to cook up hits. Now he set to teaching himself how to fashion an image. The day after cutting "Fugitive," Merle recorded two songs that made use of his outlaw past like never before. The first of these, "Life in Prison," he'd attempted back on his second Tally session in 1963, but with "Fugitive" fresh on his mind, he gave it another try. In a writing choice that would soon emerge as a pattern, "Life in Prison" exaggerated the specifics of Merle's actual sentence, and invented a crime from whole cloth, too: "Insane with rage I took my darlin's life." The song also articulates a way of feeling the world Merle's been swearing by ever since: "My life will be a burden every day/If I could die my pain might go away."

Haggard turned next to "House of Memories," his first use of penal imagery to convey a mindset: "My house is a prison"—the guards apparently reside in his head—and "there's no place to hide where your memory can't find me." Down every road there's always one more misery, the song says. Like Richard Kimble, he's always on the run, and without even having to leave the house.

After _Strangers_ went top ten, Ken Nelson suggested to Haggard that he might next do an album of truck-driving numbers of the sort being popularized by Dave Dudley, Del Reeves, and, soon enough, Bakersfield's own Kay Adams. Hag didn't think so, and Nelson gave the assignment to sometime Haggard collaborator Red Simpson, who rode the idea to success aboard the Tommy Collins–penned "Roll Truck, Roll."

There would be plenty of themed Haggard long-players to come, of course, and in hindsight, 1967's _I'm a Lonesome Fugitive_ looks a little like a first try. In addition to the on-the-run title track, Haggard's third solo album included "Life in Prison" and "House of Memories," and nearly every other track finds Merle caught in some sort of trap: Even coming upon that secret-revealing song in "Someone Told My Story . . ." freezes him in his tracks. He's on the run or looking to go throughout, an inmate or a fugitive. His "All of Me Belongs to You" is like a California country version of the old Tin Pan Alley standard, except that Merle's iteration is nightmarish ("Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams . . .") rather than fanciful, agitated rather than passive-aggressively seductive. And even though it's about being caged in a body controlled by another, it still somehow outswings Frank Sinatra.

Two songs Merle wrote when he was a teenager manage to outrock anything he'd yet recorded. With James Burton on electric guitar, a new version of "Skid Row" makes those "giggles and snickers" sting like needles and underscores that when detractors say you've "got no class" what they mean is you do too have one, _beneath them_. In "If You Want to Be My Woman," Merle complains to a girl that she needs to give him "something equal in return" to all the money he's been spending on her. "Don't look at me like maybe you don't understand," he snaps when she plays innocent. Burton and pianist Glen D. Hardin, laying down whirlwind parts that suggest a Smash-era Charlie Rich side, have got his back.

The whole album's like that, hurtling and out of control even when standing still. Merle can do nothing but sit and wait for phone calls that never come, or he answers the call of a railroad train he couldn't resist if he wanted to—and, if only on "My Rough and Rowdy Ways" (his first release of a Jimmie Rodgers song), he swears to God he wants to. On "Drink Up and Be Somebody," he pretends his pride hasn't been wounded, but needs another drink or three to do it. Even the record's loving testimonials come with warnings in the fine print. "I once lived a life without meaning . . . ," Merle admits in a song by Jerry Ward, "Mary's Mine," but now that Mary's his, he's been "given reason for living." But if Mary being "mine" is the only motivation he can find to keep breathing—Merle's hesitant delivery and brooding arrangement all but demand we consider the possibility—then what happens when, someday, Mary isn't?

It's a fantastic album, start to end, but it was the title track that made Merle a star. More to the point, it was Liz and Casey Anderson's song that suggested to Haggard an artistic persona his third album made good on. In a shot that could be a screen grab from David Jansen's TV show, _I'm a Lonesome Fugitive_ 's album cover stars Merle Haggard, as the Running Kind, hanging off the side of a boxcar and peering warily down the tracks.

**"I Started Loving You Again," 1968**

Falling back into love. What could be better, right? People sometimes sing "I Started Loving You Again," or, as it is commonly called, " _Today_ I Started Loving You Again," just that way, too—all happily, gratefully in love. Upbeat readings are only half the story, though. Listen to a cross-section of the versions of the standard cut over four decades, and you can find almost any emotional take you're looking for. Between 1968, when "Today . . ." was the B-side to Merle's "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde" single, and 1975, when it belatedly made the country top ten in a not-happy-in-the-least rendition by Sammi Smith, at least sixty recordings of the song were released. There have been pushing that many again in the decades since, and that's without counting the times it's been performed on television through the years, or during megastar arena shows and don't-forget-to-tip-your-waitress bar sets, or the just-for-fun semipro and amateur versions YouTube lists into the thousands. "Today I Started Loving You Again" is, hands down, the most performed song in Haggard's catalogue.

Considered from one angle, that makes "Today . . ." Merle Haggard's most valuable copyright. Less crassly, it's his contribution to the Great American Songbook, a song that's proven irresistible to a wide variety of singers, in all sorts of settings and interpretations, from old-school Italian-American crooner Al Martino, who scored a minor crossover hit with the song in 1968, to trippy Canadian folk-poppers the Poppy Family a few years later, to Belizean brukdown legend Wilfred Peters in 1997, to latter-day jazz songbird Diane Schuur, scatting Merle's melody up to high C's, in 2011.

In 1975, Bobby "Blue" Bland rasped his way through the song, trying at first to ignore the brassy and bass-heavy R&B house party throwing down around him, then seemingly deciding "If you can't beat 'em . . ." and volunteering to make a liquor run. All the way back in 1968, Jerry Lee Lewis used the song to help him transition from rock 'n' roller to country star—and to make plain that by loving his woman again he was doing her a favor. In 1973, on the album _Obie from Senatobie_ , O. B. McClinton borrowed the song to frame a rambling tale that ends "in a lonely room watching a faded photograph of your wedding . . . Oh sugar! I'm right back where I've really always been." In 2004, an African American gospel singer named Patrick Reid rewrote about half the words and set his Casio to "reggae"—and Merle's song was born again as a backslider's rededication to Christ: "Lord, I'm back where I always should've been."

The song's indestructible. On the Louisiana Hayride in the late 1960s, Ferlin Husky said he had time for one more number, "my favorite song," before the news at the top of the hour. He started to sing "Today I Started . . . ," but interrupted himself after the opening chorus to introduce an impersonation of the song as it might by performed by Fats Domino, then sang the final verse as Walter Brennan. The audience sings along anyway.

On her syndicated 1976 television variety series, Dolly Parton performed "Today . . ." with musical guest the Hues Corporation—a good choice for her and the trio, she explained, because it was a "soulful country song" and because "you've got the soul and I've got the country." "And I got the hair to match," she added, patting the giant blonde Afro wig that "I wore . . . just for you. I thought it'd be appropriate." Toss in jokes about the guests' "California tan" and Dolly advising the group that _they_ "need to get the soul in it" because _she's_ "the wrong color," and it's all a queasy postcard from Old Seventies America. Yet when Dolly sings a verse, and is backed by the Hues harmonies, all that vanishes, and it's just "What a fooool I was . . ."

There's Billie Jo Spears in 1968, moving about the song in slow motion, padded by echo and sounding stoned out of her mind; and John Fogerty, rock 'n' roll's great fatalist, sounding more resigned than anyone's ever been in 1973; and Tom Jones also in '73, sounding resigned himself before overpowering resignation with a gale-force voice that introduces Elvis to Otis; and Clive Gregson and Christine Collister in 1990, both of them back in love, one with the other, and both of them sounding miserable about it; and Artie "Blues Boy" White, also in 1990, turning a confession of weakness into one hell of a seductive pickup line; and in 1989 the groan-inducing-named Beasts of Bourbon, an Aussie punk outfit, doing the song all sloppy and slurry, like a drunk spoiling for a bar fight, talking far louder than necessary and hoping like hell somebody will make something of it. In 2012, I heard Bryan and the Haggards, a hard-bop and acid jazz group that does nothing but Merle songs, squawk and squeal their way through the song in a tiny bar in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. All my favorite versions travel the same melody but map new worlds.

A state-of-the-art pop-country ballad in its day, "Today I Started Loving You Again" has been naturalized into the repertoires of a variety of twang- and melody-appreciating subgenres. Most versions live in one or another style or era of straight-up country, but it's made major inroads into all sorts of related roots genres, from swamp pop and bluegrass to country soul and especially the contemporary grown-ass blues. The song's now a shared language for a variety of communities, connecting then to now, them to us, me to you—and most of all highlighting our individuality. This is what all standards can do. Lining up to be the umpteenth singer to do "At Last," say, or "White Christmas," is the vocal equivalent to dancing down the "Soul Train Line." Everyone doing the same thing shines a white-hot spot on the varied ways that everyone does their own thing.

"Today I Started . . ." has allowed country singers especially to stand out by joining in. The song's brief, conversational phrases allow singers to emphasize subtle and not so subtle differences in texture and phrasing. Indeed, when its melody is unspooled, as it usually is, at a barely mid-tempo stroll, the song encourages such treatment, cultivates and rewards distinctiveness. This is true whether we're listening to country singers with sky-high ranges (Marty Robbins, Jack Greene, Gene Watson, Martina McBride) or more earthbound instruments (Ernest Tubb, Jean Shepard, Buck Owens), or iconoclastic styles (Willie, Waylon, Emmylou, Wanda, Loretta). "Great song," each interpreter declares. "But have you heard _me_ do it?"

Listen to Merle do it, and you'll wonder how anyone ever had the guts to sing it again. As Bonnie and Merle tell the story, he wrote the song as the newlyweds were just pulling out of a rough patch in their relationship. See? Happy! But that's not the song Merle wrote, or the record he chose to make. The Strangers begin the original 1968 recording slowly, playing steadily at a singing-cowboy trot but herky-jerky too. Guitars weave unsteadily, and when Merle begins, he likewise lists side to side. If you just read his title on the page, it would seem to signal straightforwardly what's ahead—a moment of joyful clarity following some bout of temporary insanity. But listen to Merle crawl across that opening line—"Today I . . . started loving you . . . again . . ."—and you understand that here love isn't the solution but the problem, a shrinking of life's possibilities to only one: love unrequited.

Soon enough Merle says all this straight out. He was a fool to think his broken heart would ever mend. He knew better than to think "these few million tears I'd cried" would be payment anywhere near enough to get him out from under the pain. He "should have known the worst was yet to come." He even reveals his song to be a prequel to Buck Owens's 1965 hit "Crying Time." "I should have known . . . ," he tells us, "that crying time for me had just begun." But by then he's just fleshing out what his shaky, halting voice revealed from the start.

He loves her. Again. She doesn't love him. Still. What could be worse?

**The Legend of Bonnie and Him**

In the Merle Haggard story, Bonnie Owens is a key supporting character, the lead's longtime harmony singer and onetime wife. But it's worth remembering that when they recorded Liz Anderson's "Just between the Two of Us" together in 1964, it was actually Bonnie who was the better-known performer—a fixture of the Bakersfield club scene, a decade-long semipro recording artist, and a regular cast member on _Cousin Herb Henson's Trading Post_ television show. Her boyfriend, Fuzzy Owen, was a member of the house band, too, and they were known around town the way Henson introduced them on the show: "our sweethearts." She recorded for Fuzzy's Tally label, as well, helping with day-to-day operations. When she sent copies of her latest singles to DJs, she liked to slip one of Haggard's into the envelope too. The kid had real talent, she thought, and she was happy to do him the favor.

Owens was born Bonnie Campbell in Oklahoma City, in 1929, but grew up in a series of small Oklahoma towns and came of age in Arizona, where her family migrated during the war. Her dad cropped shares, labored for the WPA, and wound up doing a bit of everything through the years: He had a big job just getting by with what were eventually eight kids and a wife. They were a musical bunch—Mr. Campbell sang, for fun, and could play about anything that made sound—but Bonnie was the one who as a little girl talked about growing up to sing for a living. In her early teens, she won a state yodeling competition, and you can hear how good she was on the rollicking version of the Patsy Montana classic "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart" that concludes her 1965 album _Don't Take Advantage of Me_.

Montana was a hero of Bonnie's, as was all but inevitably the case for young women who wanted to sing country music in those days. Any moderately successful male country act included a "girl singer" in his program, but when it came to female stars, Patsy Montana was about it. When Bonnie and new husband Buck Owens went to see the Maddox Brothers & Rose in Mesa one night in the late Forties, it was a revelation. "I never took my eyes off Rose Maddox," she told Deke Dickerson. "And Buck never took his eyes off Roy Nichols."

Buck and Bonnie had been musical partners for a while by that point, working together in a string band sponsored by a local service station. Bonnie married Buck in 1948, gave birth to a boy, Buddy, soon after, and the couple had a second son, Michael, two years after that. But they divorced in 1953. It was just like Bonnie, though, that she stayed friendly with her ex. On Capitol Records' _Buck Owens Sings Tommy Collins_ , the former spouses duet charmingly on "It Tickles."

That 1963 cameo was Bonnie's major label debut, but she'd been recording off and on for years. She first gained local attention as the "singing waitress" at Bakersfield's Clover Club, and throughout the Fifties, she released a handful of singles on a series of tinier-than-tiny local labels, including "X," Del-Fi, and Mar-Vel, where she and Fuzzy cut the original "Dear John Letter" in 1953. In 1956, her keening, reverent duet on "Father" with JoAnn Miller ("the Kern County Sweethearts") was the debut release from Lewis Talley's Tally records, and several years later, when Fuzzy purchased the dormant label, one of its first releases was another Bonnie single, a Kitty Wells–styled, tear-jerking cowrite from Fuzzy and Dallas Frazier called "Why Don't Daddy Live Here Anymore." The brutally honest answer—"Because Daddy loves another woman now and he left us to be with her"—was delivered via recitation and became a top thirty country hit for Bonnie in 1963. The following year, her twice-shy "Don't Take Advantage of Me" did the same, as did her and Merle's "Just between the Two of Us," one of the numbers Liz Anderson auditioned for them in Sacramento. That single had Bonnie and Merle warning listeners not to judge a book by its cover: Everyone thinks they're the perfect couple, yet they get along so well only because they really don't care about each other anymore. When their voices come together at the chorus, though—Merle's youthful, reedy high tenor, Bonnie's brassy alto—they harmonize their alleged indifference with obvious affection.

Nineteen sixty-five was the turning point in Owens's career, for better and for worse. "Just between the Two of Us" had been a big deal for Tally: It hadn't climbed as high as Merle's "Sing a Sad Song," but had stuck around the charts for half a year. When Ken Nelson put out Merle's _Strangers_ in the fall of '65, he simultaneously released Bonnie's first full-length, _Don't Take Advantage of Me_. Like Merle's debut, Bonnie's was composed of old Tally recordings and new Capitol ones—though unlike Merle's, Bonnie's was a Top Five entry on the country album chart. Before the year was out, she won the new Academy of Country Music's first-ever award for Female Vocalist (Buck was the male winner), and as 1965 ended she seemed poised for greater successes.

It didn't happen for several reasons. The most immediate was that in the middle of it all she up and moved to Alaska. Bonnie was torn. She says she knew more success in the music business would mean more time with both Fuzzy, whom she cared for very much but wasn't sure she wanted to be with any longer, and Merle, who she sensed had feelings for her she didn't think she felt in return. Plus, Merle and Fuzzy were such good friends—the whole situation could get ugly in a hurry. Bonnie decided maybe the best course was to leave the situation altogether, so she booked herself a long engagement at a club in Alaska. Merle followed after a month or so, telephoning from Seattle that he was coming to see her. She said don't. He said I'm on my way. They married in June.

Merle's career took off at this point, but Bonnie's didn't have a chance. The following spring, their duet album came out, featuring, in addition to its indelible title hit, a knockout version of Hank Williams's "A House without Love Is Not a Home." But though the golden age of male-female duets was just ahead—teams like Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton, Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn, and George Jones and Tammy Wynette dominated country radio in the early 1970s—there was no follow-up Merle and Bonnie album, or even a follow-up single. As Merle's career strengthened, Bonnie's faded. Increasingly, she didn't get dedicated recording dates anymore, instead cutting a side or two with any leftover time on Merle's sessions. Capitol continued to release singles on her: "Number One Heel" and "Consider the Children" (a Merle composition) charted in '65 and '66, and "Lead Me On" got some play in '69. And she kept putting out albums, the most commercially successful being two that featured Haggard-written title tracks, 1967's _All of Me Belongs to You_ and 1968's _Somewhere Between_. But her releases sold less and less—the albums above charted only in the mid-30s and the singles fared worse—victims at first of scant promotion and then no promotion at all. Bonnie's image probably didn't help either; she was demure and dressed in crinoline when that version of the girl singer was becoming an antique. Now, her records were slipped into Merle's mailings.

On record and on the road, though, Bonnie's harmonies became a defining and beloved part of Haggard's sound, a contribution as important in its way as the playing of Hamlet and Nichols. The contrast between Merle's tempered-steel voice and her rusty one was bracing, and the two worked out a distinctive way of falling in and out of harmony together. Bonnie would join Merle to sing, say, "Tonight, the bottle . . ." but then fall silent for the conclusion of the line, making Merle's ". . . let me down" hit like a crash landing. "Sing me back home . . . ," they harmonize, sounding universal and bigger than life. "With a song I used to hear," Merle finishes, sounding very small and alone.

Owens seemed content to play second fiddle after she and Merle married. She liked to sing, she liked to tour, she thought her husband was a rare talent, and she didn't desire the spotlight. For his part, Merle, eight years her junior, liked to have the reliable, motherly Bonnie around, keeping track of his lyrics and ideas and just generally counteracting the rough masculinity of the road family. Bonnie seems to have well understood whom she married. She knew Merle slept with other women, regularly, and only requested that he not rub it in her face or humiliate her. "We had a little deal, Bonnie and me" is how Merle describes the marriage in _Sing Me Back Home_. "To be frank, I had what some of my friends called a perfect situation."

The situation was less perfect for Bonnie. That 1973 _Penthouse_ feature spent much of its word count on Merle's attempts to hook up with two gals in their hotel without Bonnie knowing. It's hard to read, though not nearly so hard as it must have been for Bonnie to have experienced in real time on a more or less regular basis.

"When I decided to quit the road in '74," Bonnie wrote in one of her contributions to her former husband's first autobiography, "it was as much for Merle as it was for me. . . . I felt like Merle had outgrown me. I did feel the kids [Merle's children, her stepchildren] needed me at home and I needed them. . . . I didn't know what was happening out there on the road and I didn't try to find out."

Bonnie Owens released six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and '70. They're not as consistently strong as they might be—cramming at the end of Merle's sessions, the Strangers didn't have time to work out the inventive arrangements they were capable of, and their rhythm beds for Bonnie typically have a lot less spring—but each album comes with marvelous moments. She had a lot going for her what with her pick of Merle Haggard songs and her own voice's unmistakable brassy twang. (Merle once described it as so unique that if you heard it just once, you'd instantly recognize it three hundred years later, and in the dark.) Bonnie's vocal on "Somewhere Between," for example, will stop you in your tracks, just an achingly beautiful performance that should have gone down as a career record.

I think my favorite of her solo albums was her last, _Mother's Favorite Hymns_. That 1971 gospel collection includes backing vocals by southern gospel group the Victors and by a female chorus composed of Gloria "Tainted Love" Jones, onetime Ikette Venetta Fields, and the great Merry Clayton, just months from outsinging Mick Jagger on "Gimme Shelter." The picking throughout the album is hot and acoustic, the rhythms jump with the spirit-girding energy of a Wednesday night church service, and the songs ("I Saw the Light," "Farther Along," "I'll Fly Away") are as sturdy, as welcoming and forgiving and reliable, as the one-of-a-kind voice of Miss Bonnie Owens.

**"Sing Me Back Home," 1967**

"Sing Me Back Home" cracked the _Billboard_ Hot Country Singles chart the week before Thanksgiving 1967, topped the chart before 1968 was three weeks old, and over the next year or so would be recorded by such country heavyweights as Conway Twitty, Ernest Tubb, Buck Owens, and Porter Wagoner. "Okie" and, perhaps, "Mama Tried" excepted, it's probably the song most closely identified with Merle Haggard.

You know it, right? In the first verse, a death row prisoner asks a warden, "Can my guitar-playin' friend do my request?" In the second, the prisoner asks a visiting choir if they will sing him "a song my mama sang." The chorus is as fine, economical, and mournful as any Merle Haggard ever wrote, as any written:

_Sing me back home with a song I used to hear_

_Make my old memories come alive_.

_Take me away and turn back the years_

_Sing me back home before I die_.

Throughout, Stranger Eddie Burris's kick drum pounds, throbs, like the doomed man's heart.

In the documentary _Learning to Live with Myself_ , Merle tells director Gandulf Hennig that "Sing Me Back Home" was "written years after I was out of the joint . . . from a conglomeration of information that I'd gathered while I was there."

Merle identified a bit of that conglomeration in a 1977 _Billboard_ interview with Bob Eubanks. Remembering his friend "Rabbit" Hendricks—the San Quentin inmate who escaped and killed a police officer before he was recaptured and sentenced to die in the gas chamber—Merle told Eubanks:

Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it's a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind—that's how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out . . . taking him to see the Father, . . . prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind.

"Sing Me Back Home" is a eulogy, then, for "Rabbit" Hendricks, and for Caryl Chessman, and for all of the condemned men up on the Shelf. Merle is sharing with us what he saw when he was there with them—or something akin to what he saw that later inspired a song with images of its own. Yet the song feels so much bigger than that. There is something within Merle's song, and within the grooves of the record he cut, that can't be housed behind prison walls.

In the 1936 film _Pennies from Heaven_ , Haggard favorite Bing Crosby plays a con who can't stand to be tied down: "You see, with me, when I leave a place, I get myself a feather," Crosby's character tells us. "I toss it up and whichever way the wind blows, that's where I go." Now there's a role Haggard himself could play. We might say it's a role he has played, for half a century. _Down every road there's always one more city_. And it's revealing that while Merle has only infrequently recorded selections from the Great American Songbook—Tin Pan Hollywood edition, that is—he's twice cut "Pennies from Heaven," the Arthur Johnston and Johnny Burke pop standard Crosby sings in the film.

_Pennies from Heaven_ , the movie, begins like this. There's a shot of a menacing-looking prison on a dark and stormy night, then of a newspaper headline: "Hart Dies Tonight—Goes to Chair at State Prison." Cut to inside the prison where, as "Sing Me Back Home" would one day phrase it, we see "the warden [lead] a prisoner down the hallway to his doom." "Where does that fellow with the guitar hang out?" the prisoner asks, and the warden and the prison chaplain escort him to Crosby's cell. "Many's a time I heard you out there in the yard," the prisoner tells him. "It kind of took my mind off of things." Now he hopes Crosby will do him one more favor and deliver a letter of apology to the family of the man he murdered.

"Why me?" Crosby wants to know.

"Because you're the only guy around here I can trust," the prisoner answers. "Anybody who can sing sappy, sentimental songs in a prison wouldn't double-cross a guy taking his Last Walk!"

And then he takes the walk. _Down the hallway to his doom_.

"Sing Me Back Home" finds Merle detailing an archetypal narrative—inspired by real life, sure, but long familiar from a thousand novels, movies, comic books, and television shows. It's the earnest, hymn-like melody of its chorus . . . the way the arrangement advances the lyric at a cadence conveying great respect and great sorrow, at once solemn and on edge, like a funeral procession . . . and the song's repeated appeals to memory as anodyne: "Take me away and turn back the years . . . before I die" . . . that carry Merle's song beyond cliché and frees the record from any one era or situation. "Sing Me Back Home" unfolds like a dream you somehow understand everyone else is having, too, like a folk song that seems always to have been there. No one teaches you the words. You fall in and sing along.

Prison songs were a country music staple long before Merle Haggard made them a personal specialty—at least since Vernon Dalhart's "The Prisoner's Song" ("Now if I had wings like an angel over these prison walls I would fly") in 1925, and straight along to Johnny Cash moaning "Folsom Prison Blues" at Sun in 1956 and then singing it three years later to a San Quentin audience that included Merle Haggard. It's an especially poetic coincidence that one week after Cash cut his famed live album, _At Folsom Prison_ , in January 1968, Merle's "Sing Me Back Home" became the #1 country song in the nation.

"Sing Me Back Home" feels timeless, but was a song very much of its genre and moment. The record's insistent kick drum, for example, booms out of the mix like Robert Blake's heart as he swung from the end of a rope in _In Cold Blood_ , which was itself released at the very moment "Sing Me Back Home" was debuting on the charts.

In the year and half leading up to the release of "Sing Me Back Home," the prison number that left the most indelible impression was the Curly Putman–penned "Green, Green Grass of Home." A major country hit for Porter Wagoner in the summer of 1965, and then a pop hit for the Welsh rock-and-soul belter Tom Jones in 1967, Putman's song was soon covered by virtually every country act going, and by a host of pop, rock, and soul singers, too. "Green, Green Grass of Home" was from the start a favorite of troops fighting the escalating war in Vietnam, and it almost instantly earned a spot in the Great American Songbook, Nashville edition.

It's also a song with a great deal in common with Haggard's "Sing Me Back Home." Merle included "Green, Green Grass" (and "Folsom Prison") on his successor to the _Sing Me Back Home_ album, 1968's _Mama Tried_. In both Haggard's and Putman's songs, men dream of going home. Literally, in the case of Putman's convict: In the final verse, he awakes from sweet dreams of the old hometown only to discover he's still on Death Row. Merle's prisoner longs for home too, is seeking desperately for a song that will let him imagine his way there. But both men know the only way they'll really ever make it home is in a box.

I've often wondered what song, exactly, the prisoner in "Sing Me Back Home" asks his "guitar-playing friend" to play? And what song did his mama like that he requests the street choir to sing in the song's second verse? Haggard doesn't say, letting that omitted detail stand as one more piece of the song's mysterious power—and all the better for us to hear our own request echoing off cold, stone walls. I can think of songs that might do the imaginative work necessary to lead the prisoner home. "Precious Memories," for instance, might make "the sacred past unfold." It would need to be a gospel song, in any case, for the practical reason that the "choir from off the street" would have to know it, but also because this Dead Man Walking is surely pondering more than one kind of home, more than one kind of freedom. "I'll Fly Away," by the great gospel songwriter Albert Brumley, would fit the bill. "I'll fly away like a bird from prison bars has flown" to a new "home on God's celestial shore."

The particular title doesn't matter, of course. What matters is that this man's life, however spent, deserves a song—and that the taking of his life will spur others to sing in mourning. It is loss, sharp and inevitable, that overwhelms any plea for memory whenever I listen to "Sing Me Back Home." On record, every word passes from Merle as if it hurts him deeply, but he holds in his tears, out of respect. For just under three minutes, the whole world feels like a prison; each note a separate trial, a new sentence. "Sing me back home," Merle has the prisoner plead. Glen Campbell's acoustic guitar attempts an encouraging smile, settles for grim tenderness. Norman Hamlet's pedal steel cries a pure, high note. Eddie Burris's kick drum beats one final time, and another man is gone, out of this world and headed home.

So maybe it was another Albert Brumley song that Mama used to sing:

_This world is not my home, I'm just passing through_

_Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door_

_And I can't feel at home in this world anymore_.

**He's Living in the Good Old Days**

One way to get at the importance of Merle Haggard in the last half of the 1960s is to marvel at his indelible hit singles, which, after "Fugitive" topped the country charts in early 1967, came in a rush. For the next three years, between the summer of love and the release of "The Fightin' Side of Me" in the spring of 1970, Haggard had a new #1 single every four months: "Branded Man," "Sing Me Back Home," "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," "Mama Tried," "Hungry Eyes," "Workin' Man Blues," and "Okie from Muskogee." These records have defined Haggard, and to a large degree country music, ever since.

Or we could look at his albums, which in these years were as strong as his radio hits and accumulated as rapidly. The immediate successors to _I'm a Lonesome Fugitive_ — _Branded Man_ in 1967 and, in '68, _Sing Me Back Home_ and _The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde_ —were among the finest country albums of their respective years. The albums that followed—1968's _Mama Tried_ , followed by 1969's _Pride in What I Am_ and the Jimmie Rodgers tribute, _Same Train, a Different Time_ —should be chiseled in stone as masterpieces, and the subsequent _A Portrait of Merle Haggard_ , also from '69, is only just off the mark. On these albums, Haggard's writing is as smart in its way as Dylan's at the same time or Lennon and McCartney's, his singing is as powerful as Aretha Franklin's or Van Morrison's, his attitude as sharp and dissolute as the Stones, his soundscapes and emotional intensity as arresting as those of Jimi Hendrix or the Band, or even James Brown, Haggard's only peer at the time in terms of producing such a high quantity of quality work.

In 1967, Merle followed his career-making success with the Andersons' "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive" with a pair of singles he'd written himself—"I Threw Away the Rose" and "Branded Man"—and that consolidated recent themes and successes. In '66, "Swinging Doors" and "The Bottle Let Me Down" had tracked a drunk's descent. Now, in "I Threw Away the Rose," Merle shows that same sot hitting bottom. "Once I lived a life of wine and roses," Merle begins, alluding to both the 1962 melodrama and its title song by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. But Merle isn't recommending a movie; he's deep in his cups and in danger of drowning. Though bleary-eyed, he recognizes, to his shame, that there's no one left even willing to throw him a line: "Now all my social friends look down their noses."

"Rose" climbed to #3 on the charts and was followed by "Branded Man," the second #1 of Merle's career and a record reminiscent in many ways of his first. "Branded Man" shares with "Fugitive" a relentless, loping rhythm and a liberty-seeking narrative. Here, though, instead of being pursued by police, Merle has paid his debt and been set free only to find himself still hounded—by the stigma of having done time. "I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am," but wherever he goes, no matter what he does, people treat him like a marked man: "If I live to be a hundred, I guess I'll never clear my name."

The desire to feel proud, beaten back by the reality-based fear of people treating you like you're no-account, was on Haggard's mind during this period more than usual. "Branded Man" was a little reminiscent of "Branded Wherever I Go," an old Roy Acuff number that producer Ken Nelson had cut in 1962 with Charlie and Ira Louvin but was only then preparing for fall release, and "Branded Man" also personalized the theme, and melody, of "Fugitive." But Merle was nervous about releasing it; it might give away his past and ruin his career. Sure enough, though it's unclear how the news came out, Haggard was being referred to in press accounts within the year as an ex-con, as if it were common knowledge. What Merle hadn't anticipated, though, was that his outlaw past didn't seem to matter much to the country audience. It may have helped.

When the _Branded Man_ album charted just after Labor Day, it included the two recent singles along with a few more prison songs, most notably a pair of Tommy Collins numbers, "Don't Get Married" and the be-proud-of-what-you-got closing track, "I Made the Prison Band." But the album had a bit of everything, as if Merle, having figured out who he was in the previous two years, was now trying to figure who he could be. "Loneliness Is Eating Me Alive" was a Hank Cochran song that featured the bluesy piano of Glen Hardin and a vocal that showed Hag could glide through a melody like Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin if he wanted. The oft-recorded "Long Black Limousine," covered memorably a year and a half later by Elvis Presley, was a class-based morality tale that in Merle's version reminds that we can all run but we can't hide. A recut version of his "You Don't Have Very Far to Go" (first line: "You always find a way to hurt my _pride_ . . .") begins with a heavy minor-key acoustic strum and shimmers with pop potential. "Somewhere Between," a deep country-soul ballad that has Merle and Bonnie trying to scale "a wall so high, it reaches the sky" with harmonies that soar almost but not quite high enough, deserves a spot alongside "Today I Started Loving You Again" and "Silver Wings" as the most deserving Hag hits that never were.

Two weeks before _Branded Man_ charted, Haggard was already in the studio recording most of the tracks for what would become his next album, _Sing Me Back Home_. The title track was a defining work for Haggard, both commercially (it topped the country charts a couple of weeks into the new year) and artistically, but that can't really convey how amazing it must have been to hear it on the radio as 1967 gave way to '68. Few country records of its time sound even remotely like it. For example, while "Sing Me Back Home" stands today as an exemplar of the Bakersfield Sound, it doesn't sound like any Bakersfield records to that point. It doesn't _feel_ like any either. "Sing Me Back Home" has hooks and emotional heft; it combines gravitas with fun, delicacy with doom: On the Top 40 station of my dreams, it would segue best with something like Otis Redding's "Dock of the Bay," a pop chart–topper later in '68, a record of similarly earnest accessibility, and one posing kindred existential questions. You could say the same for the record's woebegone, spirit-lifting pedal steel guitar, performed here for the first time on a Haggard session by Norman Hamlet, a steadfast Stranger from here on out.

Where did Haggard's sound come from? Producer Ken Nelson is one part of the answer. Nelson wasn't a musician himself, and he wasn't a knob-twirling auteur, either. His standard operating procedure was to set the tape rolling, doodle on scrap paper during the performance, and then either suggest another take or declare it "a pleasure to behold"—estimations his artists quickly learned to trust. Nelson had an ear for talent and material and for sounds that would do well on the radio, not just right now but _soon_. In 1956, as head of Capitol's country division, he signed rockabilly Gene Vincent and released "Be-Bop-a-Lula" in the wake of Elvis's initial breakthrough; the following year he produced "Gone," the swelling Ferlin Husky dreamscape that would prove a key template for the Nashville Sound. Wildly different country records, but Nelson's job wasn't to enforce a style. He was an old-school A&R man, Artist & Repertoire, and he had the role's key skill: He could hear _pop_.

So could Haggard's longtime session leader, studio guitar ace James Burton. A member of the Louisiana Hayride's backing band when he was fifteen, and the lead guitarist on Dale Hawkins's germinal "Suzie Q" a couple of years later, Burton had spent his career blurring the blurry-to-begin-with lines between blues, rock 'n' roll, and country, then refocusing the lines into hits. By the time he was eighteen, he was a Californian and playing Fender Telecaster on many of Ricky Nelson's defining records. That's Burton's economical solo on "Travelin' Man," for example, a major radio presence in the months after Merle's release from San Quentin—and expounding upon a theme Merle knew a thing or two about. Soon Burton had joined the house band on the L.A.-based musical series _Shindig!_ while logging countless sessions with everyone from Martin and Sinatra to Buffalo Springfield, the Monkees, Johnny Rivers, and the Everly Brothers: Burton picked out the lead to the Everlys' version of "Mama Tried" six months after playing on Merle's. An impressive résumé, each bullet point anticipating Burton's work with Elvis Presley in the '70s.

His work with Haggard might be his greatest of all. Ken Nelson had used Burton on sessions for a while, including some with Buck Owens, and recommended him as someone with a knack for coming up with memorable, radio-ruling guitar licks. Merle didn't need persuading. Deke Dickerson notes that Merle was already nuts about Burton's playing, especially his work on one of Rick Nelson's first stabs at country, 1966's "You Just Can't Quit." And no wonder, as Burton's searing sound on that record predicts dozens of Haggard sides to come. As Merle explained to _Downbeat_ in 1980, James "was doing a thing called chicken-pickin'. But he wasn't really bending strings. Roy [Nichols], on the other hand, was doing the string bending but wasn't doing the chicken-pickin'. . . . [O]ur guitar style came out of a marriage between the styles." Though Nichols played lead on stage, he typically sat out or played a supporting role when James Burton was on the session—and most of the time, from '66 to '70 when he left to head Presley's band, Burton was on the session: He played most of the Haggard licks we recognize today. The doomsaying acoustic figure that sends "Sing Me Back Home" to its date with the gallows; the weaving lines of "The Bottle Let Me Down" or the weeping ones of "Hungry Eyes"; the belligerence that begins "The Fightin' Side of Me"—in the last half of the Sixties, it was almost always James Burton announcing Haggard records _as_ Haggard records. And, typically from note one too, as hits.

Haggard followed "Sing Me Back Home" with "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," another country #1 in April 1968, and the rare hit to emerge in these years from a Burton-less recording session: The reckless acoustic guitar that springs the single is by Merle's old Bakersfield pal Billy Mize, and Glen Campbell gave the record its hurtling, wind-in-your-hair feel on banjo. Campbell was poised to become a star himself—his "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" was on the charts with "Sing Me Back" and "Legend" both—and Merle helped all he could, including his fellow Capitol artist's record in his DJ mailings. But while "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" cracked the pop Top 40, none of Merle's records did. Perhaps a gorgeous Al Delory string arrangement of the sort gracing Campbell's hit would've helped Merle's similarly moody and melodic "Today I Started Loving You Again" get wider airplay. Maybe it was the banjo that killed any of the pop potential in "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," although it hadn't stopped Flatt & Scruggs's "Foggy Mountain Breakdown (Theme from _Bonnie & Clyde_)" from becoming a minor sensation around the same time.

In 1968, this must have seemed like the way of the world. The fetishization of small differences _is_ pop culture at any given moment, though those differences can sometimes be tough to pin down only a short time later. That was especially true for "Sing Me Back Home," a one-of-a-kind record but one that featured an acoustic-plus-electric blend, leaning heavily to the former, and laid over thumping bass and drum, that made it of a sonic piece, generally speaking, with contemporaneous country records that did go pop: "Harper Valley PTA," for instance, or Capitol releases like "Ode to Billie Joe" and "Gentle on My Mind." Nothing on Haggard's _Sing Me Back Home_ and its successor, _The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde_ , had similar successes, but the two albums did similarly survey pop-relevant subjects with similar folky, pop-minded arrangements.

The same was true of Haggard's next album, _Mama Tried_ , in 1968. The title track became Merle's fifth career #1 that summer, and had it all: Mama, a misspent youth, trains, prison, an arrangement that seamlessly combined the plugged and unplugged and that identified itself from its first notes. James Burton's heart-racing Dobro calls out like the open road, then Roy Nichols's Fender doubles you over like a sucker punch in the gut. With all due respect to David Allan Coe's and Steve Goodman's later claims for "You Never Even Called Me by My Name," Merle Haggard's "Mama Tried" is "the perfect country & western song."

It's amazing how many other moments on _Mama Tried_ punch as hard. On his own "I'll Always Know," Merle comes off suspicious as all hell, paranoid to the point of being out of his mind. "Someday soon I know you plan to hurt me . . . ," he declares, presumably because hurting him is just what people do. "But I'll always know when you've been cheatin'," he threatens, and his and Bonnie's harmonies are terrifying. Only two tracks earlier he'd sounded so wise, too. On "In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)," the first of several Dolly Parton songs he's recorded, Merle finds strength in his past, not because it was any place he'd like to return to, but because he knows it made him, for worse and for better too, who he is today.

Who he is, is the running kind, as free and unfree as a bird. On the album's closing track, another Dallas Frazier song called "Too Many Bridges to Cross Over," Haggard advises the woman he's with not to grow accustomed to having him around. "Like an eagle," he warns her, "I'm a prisoner of the wind." You could listen to Merle sing that line—he's bragging and complaining both—for the rest of your days and never get to the bottom of all it suggests regarding the hot-wired relationship between individual freedom and the limits, man-made and built-in, that go with being human.

"Mama Tried" had potential to reach beyond the country audience that went unrealized, at least in Merle's version, and the whole album has pop ambition unusual for a late-Sixties country release. It's worth noting that "Mama Tried" is followed by covers of two songs that had been pop hits the previous year—"Green, Green Grass of Home" by Tom Jones, "Little Ole Wine Drinker Me" by Dean Martin—and that side one ends with Merle's version of "Folsom Prison Blues," which Johnny Cash took Top 40, via a live recording, months before. The trapped soul Cash portrays in "Folsom Prison" is haunted by the lonesome whistle of the train he hears rolling by each day, year after year after year. Its riders are bound for San Antonio, the song says, but the hell of it for Cash's con is that folks are free to move about at all. "Those people keep a- _movin'_ ," Merle groans through gritted teeth, "and _that's_ what tortures me."

Haggard flirted with mainstream success throughout the year or so leading to his Muskogee Moment. In September 1968, he became one of the few country acts to appear on _American Bandstand_. This coup was doubtless the work of host Dick Clark, who, after working with Haggard on _Killers Three_ , had insisted he could transform the country star into a pop star, if Merle were willing.

That was a more realistic possibility than might be remembered today. Country was entering its crossover-minded "countrypolitan" phase when the music achieved more success at pop radio than at any time before or since—and when pop acts frequently made it onto country radio, too. From 1968, when Tammy Wynette, Jeannie C. Riley, Bobbie Gentry, Bobby Goldsboro, and Glen Campbell all placed big records in both the pop and country Top 40s; into the early 1970s when Charlie Rich, Anne Murray, Sammi Smith, Ray Price, Olivia Newton-John, John Denver, and Elvis Presley, among others, did the same; to the Waylon-and-Willie-led Outlaw movement of the mid-'70s; and on to the early-'80s days of _Urban Cowboy_ —throughout a long stretch of Haggard's career, the line between the country and pop audiences was quite permeable, musically speaking, even as that line became more politically rigid.

What was happening on radio was both cause and result of what was happening on television: Country singers were frequent guests on, and even hosted their own, national TV shows during the Muskogee Moment. Haggard benefited as much as anyone from country's newfound cachet. After "Okie" and through the summer of 1971, Haggard released seven consecutive singles that at least "Bubbled Under" on _Billboard_ 's Hot 100. In between those, in addition to _Bandstand_ , Haggard appeared on _Music Scene_ , Campbell's _Goodtime Hour_ , and, seven times, on _Hee Haw_. He showed up three times on _The Johnny Cash Show_ , as well, and once, singing "Workin' Man Blues," on _Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters_. Hag was on the big screen, too. In the 1970 John Wayne vehicle, _Chisum_ , Haggard's voice was heard singing "Turn Around," a string-swollen ballad à la Glen Campbell's title song from Wayne's previous film, _True Grit_.

Country acts were also being covered by big-city newspapers and general interest magazines as never before. Merle saw _Sing Me Back Home_ reviewed in that bastion of middle-class, middle-American, "middlebrow" middle-ness, _Life_ , and in '71 he was featured in one of the final issues of _Life_ 's poor cousin, _Look_. In the same period, Haggard was reviewed and profiled several times in _Rolling Stone_ , at this point still growing its hair long and shaggy out in San Francisco, and in Atlanta's underground weekly, _The Great Speckled Bird_. The Hag played well on both the hip and square sides of the street.

He had the looks to be a star: Publicity photos from this period have him looking like a blue-collar James Dean; one writer described him as "a cross between Audie Murphy and Warren Beatty." He had the songs, too. "Swingin' Doors," "The Bottle Let Me Down," and "Hungry Eyes," among others, were cut often by Nashville types, and "Sing Me Back Home" and "Mama Tried" were endlessly covered by rock and country acts alike. Corny old-school pop crooners cut his tunes: Dean Martin's "I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am" beat "Okie" to the pop charts by a couple of months, and a couple of months later, Al Martino crept onto the charts with one of the first noncountry covers of "I Started Loving You Again." In fact, Haggard had so many good songs that other country singers had taken to cherry-picking the best of his leftovers for hits of their own. In 1967, Maine-based country singer Dick Curless landed a #28 country hit with Merle's "All of Me Belongs to You," then followed it with "House of Memories." Ernest Tubb made "One Sweet Hello" the title track of an album in 1971, and in '73, Charley Pride topped the country countdown with "Shoulder to Cry On." "I'd Rather Be Gone" went Top Five for Hank Williams Jr. in 1970, and Conway Twitty did the same a year later with "I Wonder What She'll Think about Me Leaving." Most of these songs wouldn't make it onto Hag's own albums for years.

More important than the songs, as far as pop success was concerned, not to mention the larger cultural conversation such success allowed, was that Haggard had the _records_. The 1968 _Sing Me Back Home_ review that ran in _Life_ said its title track "could be a Top 40 hit tomorrow if the big-city stations would play it." The same was true of the following year's "Workin' Man Blues," with its rocking Elvis-in-Vegas rhythm, and for its B-side, "Silver Wings," as pure pop a record as Haggard ever made. "Don't leave me, I cried, don't take that airplane ride," Merle sings, his baritone borne aloft by strings that roar and shimmer. A brooding piano lick keeps circling back around, though, and the record ends with Merle wingless and earthbound and watching the sky.

For Merle, it was the sky that seemed the limit.

Haggard's next two albums were released only three months apart in the first half of 1969. _Pride in What I Am_ came first. A single, "I Take a lot of Pride in What I Am," climbed only to #3, Merle's lowest entry in three years, and the album itself went only to #11. Then, _Same Train, a Different Time_ , Merle's narrated tribute to the nearly-forty-years-gone Singing Brakeman Jimmie Rodgers, topped the country album chart, even without a supporting single.

Merle had been inching toward the Rodgers album for a while. He'd included the Blue Yodeler's "Rough and Rowdy Ways" on _Fugitive_ in 1967, and _Pride in What I Am_ included the same version of "California Blues" that opened _Same Train_. We've seen how Rodgers's music, learned from the Lefty Frizzell 78s his mother bought him, was a formative influence on young Haggard, so let's note here that on _Same Train, a Different Time_ , Merle doesn't try to re-create those Lefty performances, and mostly only waves in the direction of Rodgers's originals. Instead, on "California Blues" and "Waiting for a Train," on "Train Whistle Blues" and "Frankie and Johnny" and the rest, the album is built upon contemporary rhythms that swing and thump—hard, thanks to Eddie Burris's kick drum and brush work and to Jerry Ward's electric bass. The album also showcases more than ever James Burton's very full and electric- _sounding_ Dobro and, a few times, gives it up for Roy Nichols on electric. Along with Merle's knowing, state-of-the-art country croon, augmented here and there by Roy's harmonica, these had been identifying features of the Strangers' modern studio sound for a couple of years already. The Rodgers project was traditional rather than retro, in other words. Merle's riding the _Same Train_ , but his emphasis is on _A Different Time_. Now.

Switch out that Dobro for a slide and you've got the basic template for a bulk of the tracks on the Rolling Stones' _Beggars Banquet_ , out only a few months prior to _Same Train_. The biggest sonic differences in the projects come down to the Stones' simpler lines and louder drums, and their self-consciously rougher and rowdier textures—a British art student's notion of what a poor boy could do—and Merle and the Strangers' just-as-fussed-over but more-clean-and-polished tones and fancier picking. Haggard's ideal of what a poor boy could do, once he'd made it, was to have some nice things and show them off.

The same goes for _Pride in What I Am_ , an album that stands with Haggard's best. That not-quite-title-track single is contemporary country at its most cutting-edge, simultaneously embracing pretty pop sounds—the record's sprightly, rolling guitar figure is reminiscent of Glen Campbell's "Gentle on My Mind"—and rebellious rock subject matter—"Things I learned in a hobo jungle are things they never taught me in a classroom." "I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am" finds Merle uncharacteristically peaceful and satisfied, sleeping on benches and happy to be "living off the fat of our great land," and on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band–sounding closer, he even proclaims, "I Think We're Living in the Good Old Days." "The Day the Rains Came," meanwhile, is wondrous, weird, and lovely. Merle and a lover take refuge in a cave during a storm, amidst idyllic folk guitar and otherworldly backing vocals that haunt until they soothe. If he can only hold on in memory to what he found with her in that cave, Merle sings, then he'd be happy forever. If he can remember that, and if the world should give him nothing more, then the world has given him enough.

But such contentment is a state of mind that comes and goes for Merle. On a brutal cover of the Stonewall Jackson hit "Who Will Buy the Wine," Merle sounds bitter as poison. In "I'm Bringing Home Good News," he's "sittin' downtown in a tav-run" when it comes to him that he's going to leave his girl for good, and he races home to pack. On Jimmie Rodgers's "California Blues," he's gone.

"I'm going off of the deep end. . . . I disagree with the way that I'm living," he half laughs, half chokes on a dissolute country blues called "I Can't Hold Myself in Line." Just the same, he intends to "head full speed ahead down the wrong road of life." His weakness is stronger than he is, he allows. Then he laughs again, just a little, though not because he thinks it's all that funny.

By the end of the Sixties, much of Haggard's music could fairly be termed "country rock." That doesn't just mean rock 'n' roll with some country thrown in. Country music had been present at rock 'n' roll's birth, what with Chuck Berry copping "Ida Red" for "Maybelline" and Elvis Presley's first single featuring countrified blues on its A-side and bluesy country on the flip. Rock 'n' rollers had been mixing the forms quite explicitly ever since. Again, James Burton with Ricky Nelson stands out, but so does the instrumental electric guitar work of Duane Eddy, Dick Dale, any number of rockin' little surfer bands, and especially of the Seattle-based instrumental group the Ventures, who learned their first hit, 1960's "Walk, Don't Run," off a Chet Atkins LP, and who two years later cut an album of country songs, including Cash's "I Walk the Line" and Bob Wills's "San Antonio Rose." The group's principal guitarist, Nokie Edwards, was a transplanted Oklahoman who'd played with Buck Owens.

For country music, all those electric guitars, Fender Telecasters as often as not, quickly became just another tool for producing the genre's defining aesthetic effect: twang. This was particularly true in the Okie-dominated San Joaquin. Bakersfield bar bands mixed plenty of rock 'n' roll into their country sets because audiences enjoyed dancing to both and because, increasingly, it was hard to tell the difference. Long before Buck Owens was charged with hypocrisy for swearing allegiance to country music in advance of an album that included a Chuck Berry song, he'd already covered the Coasters and the Drifters. Coming from the rock 'n' roll direction, Owens and Haggard's Capitol label mates, the Beatles, had covered Buck's "Act Naturally" and went all Bakersfieldy on one of their own songs, "Run for Your Life," in 1965.

The Beatles, along with Bob Dylan, are keys here, since country rock requires, technically speaking, something called _rock_ , as distinguished from _rock 'n' roll_ , for existence in the first place. Perhaps Haggard seems an odd fit in this context? We have a strong sense today of Haggard being about as country as they come—and, thanks to hippie-jabbing hits ahead, about as antithetical to rock music, too, what with the style's necessarily Dylan-inspired songwriting and its identification with the drug culture, the sexual revolution, the political Left, and the other primarily youth- and primarily middle-class-associated phenomena we today term the Sixties. The differences were real.

But that didn't mean distinctions were always easily made in real time. Just before "Okie from Muskogee" hit in the fall of 1969, and to an only slightly diminished degree afterward, Haggard was a greatly admired songwriter among those rock musicians experimenting with returns to rock 'n' roll's rootsy origins, country roots included. Dylan was cutting albums with session cats in Nashville, and rock bands like Creedence Clearwater Revival (they gave a shout-out to Buck Owens on 1970's "Lookin' Out My Back Door") and the Rolling Stones were scoring hits with unabashedly twangy LPs like _Bayou Country_ and _Green River_ , _Beggars Banquet_ and _Let It Bleed_ , respectively. Merle was a cult hero to these acts—a proletarian poet, a rebel—an assessment that carried over to later-arriving Caliish country rockers like the Gram Parsons–led Flying Burrito Brothers, Poco, Neil Young, Linda Ronstadt, and the Eagles. As the 1960s ended, Merle had the ear of a lot of the same people his "Okie" and "Fightin' Side" would openly disdain.

The Byrds, for example, had turned from Dylan-inflected folk-rock to Haggard-loving country rock with the help of Parsons, who'd done Merle's "I Must Be Somebody Else You've Known" while leading the International Submarine Band in 1966. The Byrds performed Merle's "Sing Me Back Home" on the Grand Ole Opry in March 1968—with Merle's record still lingering on the charts—and when the group's _Sweetheart of the Rodeo_ was released in August, it included Haggard's "Life in Prison." Most remarkably, the Grateful Dead included "Mama Tried" in their storm-shortened set at that crowning glory of the rock era, "Woodstock—Three Days of Peace and Music," and, for a couple of minutes, Merle Haggard. The Dead put an unaccountably funky "Mama Tried" on a self-titled 1971 album, and a year after Merle had "Workin' Man Blues," these quintessential long-and-shaggy-haired San Fran hippies had _Workingman's Dead_.

Haggard was thirty-two in 1969, but had connections, briefly, with the never-trust-anyone-over-thirty youth culture nonetheless. _Killers Three_ , the movie for which "Mama Tried" was written, played a role in boosting Merle's Love Generation credibility, for instance, or at least that was part of the idea. A movie where the youthful outlaw protagonists are troubled and violent but basically good kids, _Killers Three_ was Dick Clark's attempt to ride the coattails of _Bonnie and Clyde_. That 1967 Arthur Penn film was, in some ways, deeply nostalgic, but, typical of the way nostalgia works in American culture, its backward glance wasn't about The Past so much as it was an attempt to process Now. Nearly everyone who saw _Bonnie and Clyde_ understood it was commenting upon the era's increasingly violent Generation Gap and, what's more, was actively rooting for the kids. Merle was obsessed with the film. Drawn to its Depression-era setting (much of it in Oklahoma) and its doomed young outlaws (fugitives!), he saw it six times—he was especially enamored of Faye Dunaway's Bonnie—and determined to translate it into song.

"The Legend of Bonnie & Clyde" was cut early in 1968. By April it was another country #1, Merle's third in a row, and he and Ken Nelson made it the title track to his next album. Merle plays dress-up in gangster pinstripes on the cover, wielding a tommy gun and posing with a Dunaway look-alike. The following spring, Merle performed the song before a national audience on _The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour_. Campbell replicated the single's running-for-their-lives acoustic lick, while on banjo, to Merle's left, sat freak-flag-flying folkie and _Goodtime Hour_ regular John Hartford.

Merle's reading of the Bonnie and Clyde legend omits key details from the film: the impotence of Warren Beatty's Clyde, most obviously, and for that matter any sex at all. Merle draws markedly different conclusions from the tale, too. The film has us siding with the kids, hoping they escape with their lives and without punishment, but Merle intones a moral he presents as unavoidable: "For robbin' and killin', they both had to pay." Still, in the wake of _Bonnie and Clyde_ , any mention of the outlaw duo came with sympathetic connections to youthful rebellion. For country rock's early adopters, and for anyone else paying attention, "The Legend of Bonnie & Clyde" was one more bit of evidence that Merle Haggard, just maybe, was on the kids' side, too.

But those differences persisted and could be tough to negotiate. Gram Parsons was a devoted Haggard fan. While with the Flying Burrito Brothers, he'd cut "Sing Me Back Home" like everyone else and had spent several months introducing the Stones' Keith Richards to his hero's music. Parsons was such a Haggard man that while preparing to record his 1971 solo debut, he sought out Merle to produce. The two even met to discuss the project but decided against it. In some versions of the story, that was because Merle was too busy to fit Parsons in. That was actually a likely story, with Merle booked on the road almost constantly while also finishing up several albums of his own—plus, Gram the rocker was thinking along the lines of weeks to make his record, whereas Merle the country singer was much more of a three-tracks-in-a-four-hour-session cultural worker. In another version of the story, though, from Parsons's Byrds and Burrito Brothers partner, Chris Hillman, what actually sunk the collaboration was that "Gram was drunk. So Merle quit." That could be, too. Haggard liked to drink himself, among other diversions, but he believed in getting up and going to work, doing the job the best you could—and figured you'd need to be something like sober to do it.

The patron saint of country rock didn't get Haggard to produce, but he got the next-best thing: Merle's longtime Capitol engineer, Hugh Davies. He also landed James Burton and Glen Hardin, who'd played on nearly all the signature records, and drummer Ronnie Tutt, who'd been on "Okie from Muskogee," all three on a break from backing Elvis on the road. Nineteen seventy-three's _GP_ is a gem of a record, laconic and anguished, tight as a drum but pleasantly rag-ass when it needs to be, and what it lacks in fullness of tragicomic vision it embraces entirely by being very, very serious. Still, I do sometimes wish it rocked as hard as one of Merle's records.

Merle's final LP of the decade made the album chart just one week before "Okie from Muskogee" cracked the singles chart and changed his life. _A Portrait of Merle Haggard_ collected his most recent #1's, the for-the-ages one-two punch of "Hungry Eyes" and "Workin' Man Blues," plus the beautiful "Silver Wings," along with several of the strong stray tracks he had lying around in seemingly unlimited supply. Some, like a Nashville Sounding version of the George Jones hit "She Thinks I Still Care," were more than a year old, while others, like the dreamy, string-laden "Every Fool Has a Rainbow," were brand-new. "And the rule applies to me," Merle confesses of his own over-the-rainbow dreams. He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.

On "Workin' Man Blues," he does both. Haggard had written the song because, after Johnny Cash charted anew with "Folsom Prison Blues," he'd begun to dream of an identity-solidifying, common-man anthem of his own. That Cash connection explains why Burton kicks off "Workin' Man" with a lick in the same extra fat, echoey tone he'd used a year before to launch Merle's own version of "Folsom Prison," a production choice that was itself a louder, more muscular version of Luther Perkins's echoing opening lick to Cash's 1956 original. But it isn't Burton's "Workin' Man" heralding lick, as insistently melodic as it is, that matters as much as the rhythm part that drives the record to its conclusion.

There are antecedents for what Haggard and Burton do here. Think of the skittering, indomitable rhythm guitar that Scotty Moore used to power Elvis's Sun Records–era sides like "Mystery Train" and "Milk Cow Blues" and think, especially, of Ricky Nelson's own "Milk Cow Blues," with guitar provided by James Burton. On "Workin' Man Blues," Burton solders these ideas to his own lacerating lines, and, together with session bassist Chuck Berghofer, he propels the Hag headlong to his future. Burton and the Strangers had ridden a kindred rocking guitar groove on 1968's "I'm Bringing Home Good News," but "Workin' Man" sets the standard.

At the end of each verse, Haggard stops singing for a moment. The band pauses, too, as if they've all stepped outside for a smoke break, but Burton keeps playing, insisting everyone get back to work. "Here comes that working man," Merle says to introduce a solo, probably from Roy Nichols, that's heedless yet somehow controlled—a Fender Telecaster screaming the blues, then shaking them off to dance instead. After that, it's back to the rhythm that would soon be recognized the world over as Elvis's fanfare.

We hear a hammer dinging repetitively against an anvil throughout, homage to Wynn Stewart's "Another Day, Another Dollar." Merle hears a train, and it has him longing to take off. Is it the Mystery Train? Is it the train that mocked Cash's Folsom prison con? Doesn't matter. Merle's got work to do, nine kids and a wife to feed and clothe, and rainbow dreams notwithstanding, he isn't going anywhere. On Friday, he'll cash his check, drink a few beers with buddies before heading home, and come Monday, he'll be at work.

"I ain't never been on welfare," he infamously boasts in the final verse. "And that's one place I won't be." Then he explains why: "I'll be workin' . . ." His voice flattens at the thought, his spirit crushed by the certainty of it. He sounds shaky and old. "I'll be workin' as long as my two hands are fit to use." He sips his beer, accepts the years of work ahead, and prays his hands stay fit as long as he's going to need them.

**He Likes Living Right and Being Free**

As "Okie from Muskogee" rocketed up the country charts on its way to becoming a minor crossover hit, Merle Haggard appeared on the short-lived ABC series _Music Scene_. Hosted by a cast of presumably counterculture-cool comedians (including David Steinberg and Lily Tomlin), and focused around performances of each week's higher-charting records on _Billboard_ 's various singles charts, _Music Scene_ survives on DVD as a snapshot of American pop culture at that moment when the Sixties gave way to the Seventies. The show's comedy intros—Nixon jabs, "bad needle" jokes—have dated badly, but the music remains amazing.

_Music Scene_ 's October 20, 1969, episode kicked off with musical guest Sly & the Family Stone, who tore through a take-no-prisoners live performance that skipped the group's smash of the moment, "Hot Fun in the Summertime," in favor of a pair of hits from the year before. Sly himself is a sight to behold, resplendent in a puffy-sleeved goldenrod blouse kind of thing that cinches in front, exposing his stomach. The Family Stone raced through an abbreviated "Everyday People," their Love Crowd embrace of we're-all-in-this-togetherness: "Different strokes for different folks . . . We got to live together!" The group then veered quickly into "Dance to the Music," an even more irresistible call, though one that builds to a less inviting exhortation from trumpeter Cynthia Robinson: "All the squares go home!" As Sly keyboarded the song to a close, the dancing-to-the-music studio audience nearly crowded the band off the stage. No squares here.

_Music Scene_ 's guest host that week was Tom Smothers, one half of the folk-revival comedy duo the Smothers Brothers. The Smotherses' establishment-tweaking series, the controversial _The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour_ , had been canceled only that April: For tardy script submission, CBS said; for pissing on the president, and middle-American values generally, everyone understood. Adding insult to injury, _The Comedy Hour_ was replaced by that antithesis of counterculture cool, _Hee Haw_ , a frozen-in-amber bit of C&W vaudeville that was almost instantly more popular than the Smotherses' show had been. Now, on _Music Scene_ , Tom Smothers had to introduce Merle Haggard, _Hee-Haw_ 's second-episode guest star back in June and a performer on the show three more times by Labor Day. Normally Tom plays a naïve dummy to the comic exasperation of his brother Dick, but not tonight. Tonight Tom's playing Himself, a persona oozing bitterness. Understandably so, given recent developments, but harder to cotton is Smothers's condescension, a sneer he aimed not only at the man he's introducing but at any of the everyday people viewing at home who might be inclined to endorse, or just enjoy, what's to follow.

"Throughout the time the show's been on the air, it has had some really groovy aware guests on the show," Smothers begins. He's sitting on the studio floor, surrounded by an integrated group of with-it-looking youth. No beads or Roman sandals can be seen, but there are smock-tops and long hair. "You know, the Beatles and John Lennon singing 'Give Peace a Chance,'" Smothers continues. "And very hip people . . .

"Uh, now, under the Equal Time Provision set up by the, uh, Bureaucratic, uh, Establishment"—Smothers is mumbling—"uh, Orientation of America, we've got to make adjustments and give equal time to the other side. So, here's Merle Haggard with a song that jumped from #30 to #7 on the Hot Country, uh, Singles Chart of _Billboard_." Smothers feigns a cough and, after covering his mouth in mock politeness, mimes taking a hit off a joint. Finally, still holding make-believe smoke in his lungs, Smothers chokes, "Ladies and Gentlemen. Merle Haggard. 'Okie from Muskogee.'" Smothers fake releases fake smoke and grins.

I expected the camera to pan right or left now, revealing Merle Haggard and the Strangers set up to play live in the studio just as Sly and the Family Stone had a moment before. The screen went black instead, save a circle of spotlight that bounced in and out of center as the camera began a slow zoom. Probably a pre- or posttaped segment, I realize. Which means, too, that Haggard likely wasn't there to hear Smothers introduce him as the government-mandated "other side." He doesn't know, as viewers at home do, that his performance has been presented as a joke and that he's the punch line.

The camera moves closer. Following Sly Stone would be a nearly impossible task under the best circumstances, but Merle has been triply handicapped in the attempt, sitting down (on a white-railed porch), without his Strangers, and with a bloodhound sitting inexplicably at his side. Merle croons gently, almost sweetly, and he punctuates his song's details—"We don't smoke marijuana . . . We still wave Old Glory . . . holdin' hands and pitchin' woo"—with frequent bemused grins, as if to say, "I know, I know. Hard to believe, huh? But we really are this square." The song, this night, feels like an embracing of, accompanied by a chuckle at, the out-of-fashion ways of small-town America. When Merle declares in the title line how proud he is of all this, he mugs broadly, even rolls his eyes just a bit, like he knows all of it—the pride, the song, the Hag—must be just about the corniest thing you ever heard. Old Glory? White lightnin'? _Woo?_ After Sly's miniriot, Merle Haggard comes off less like a representative of another side and more like an ambassador from another planet. The name of this alien world is "Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.A."

Then, lights come up, and what's revealed isn't alien at all, but distressingly familiar. Merle's white-railed porch is surrounded by American flags—as the camera retreats, there are more and more of them until it's as if Merle has been singing from the middle of a military cemetery. And just like that, a song in part protesting antiwar protesters has been commandeered by the show's set designer _into_ an antiwar protest.

In 2008's _Nixonland_ , historian Rick Perlstein identified the immediate origins of America's past half century of polarized politics in Richard Nixon's rise to the White House and particularly in his Republican Party's enlisting of the so-called Silent Majority in to-the-death Culture War. "What one side" in this fight "saw as liberation, the other saw as apocalypse. And what the other saw as apocalypse, the first saw as liberation." "Nixonland" is Perlstein's term for "what happens when these two groups try to occupy a country together." Here's another way to think of it: As the Sixties gave way to the Seventies, Nixonland was where Merle Haggard singing "Okie from Muskogee" was either heavenly music to your ears or your idea of hell.

Of course, it was far more complicated than that. There were a hundred, a thousand, different sides, so many sides it was never easy to predict where real people would align themselves from one situation to the next. There were those who supported the Vietnam War and those who didn't. Increasingly, there were mainstream Americans who hated the war but were repulsed by the war-protesting counterculture. It was hard hats versus hippies, _The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour_ versus _Hee Haw_ , rednecks and blue-collar ethnics enraged by Panthers, Black and White. It was black versus white. Teenage peaceniks faced off against teenage National Guardsmen. Archie Bunker argued with Meathead. Law-and-order types despised draft dodgers. _Ms_. challenged _Ladies Home Journal_. Liberal Democrats were challenged by the New Left as moderate Republicans fought conservative Republicans—and they all fought George Wallace, except when they didn't. It was straights and squares versus longhairs and druggies, Frazier versus Ali, and it was Getting Involved and Getting Ahead versus Dropping Out and dropping acid. The Way We've Always Done It was pitted against It's Time We Do It Better, and both of those positions squared off against Burn the Whole Thing Down, starting with the flags. And so on versus so on. As much as anything it was a fight between wildly differing conceptions of what it meant, as Haggard put it, to live right and be free.

"Okie from Muskogee" mentioned little of this directly, but suggested it all. It was an instant rallying cry _and_ instant bête noire. It also turned "Merle Haggard" into a household name, though in some homes _it wasn't all that friendly when they said it_.

The "Okie from Muskogee" origin story changes slightly from telling to telling, but it always begins in Spring 1969, with Merle and the Strangers driving through eastern Oklahoma on their tour bus. Or maybe they were still on the Arkansas side of the state line headed west, but in any event one of the Strangers spots a road sign that informs them Muskogee, thataway, thirty miles (or maybe it was a hundred), and then somebody, maybe it was drummer Roy "Eddie" Burris but it might've been somebody else, maybe even Merle, makes a joke: "I bet they don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee."

Everyone aboard agrees that's pretty damn funny. Funny, presumably, because at that very moment a joint was being passed among them, but perhaps it was just that a busload of California musicians, blue-collar and small-town-bred but now worldly and big-time, could laugh with relief at how far they'd come, and in sympathy with where they'd come from: as in, "There but for the grace of God . . ." Everyone starts brainstorming what else they probably don't do in Muskogee—drop acid, throw orgies, grow long hair, protest. In some versions, Merle writes the song right then, doesn't take him but about twenty minutes. At one point (this according to Deke Dickerson's Bear Family liner notes), Merle can't remember what it is you call those dang fool things hippies wear on their feet, and when Burris chimes in with "Roman sandals," Merle thanks his drummer by awarding him 25 percent of the publishing.

Other versions of the "Okie" story don't have Merle finishing the song until later. He hears Garner Ted Armstrong, the evangelical host of radio's _The World Tomorrow_ , claiming that small-town southern colleges hadn't experienced unrest like the Berkeleys and Madisons of the world. That's when Merle added the bits about football being "the roughest thing on campus" (as opposed, say, to blowing up the science building) and kids still respecting the college dean (as opposed to occupying his offices). When he played the finished product for Fuzzy Owen and asked what he thought, the manager said, "I _think_ it needs to be _out_."

Sometime early that summer, the stories go, Merle, Bonnie, and the boys are playing an NCO club at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, but nothing's connecting. The officers just sit there, staring and applauding politely, so Haggard figures, what the hell, let's try that new one. And then . . . "The whole place went berserk," the officers are on their feet, cheering and whooping, like to tear the place down. The NCOs storm the stage to shake Merle's hand, slap him on the back, hug his neck. Play it again, they tell him. You just got to play that song again; we're not going to let you leave if you don't. Haggard and the band have never in their lives experienced anything like this. They play "Okie" again, perhaps four times, the military men repeating favorite lines and shouting with the chorus. Afterward, on the bus to the next gig, a time when people are normally wiped and just want to get some shut-eye ahead of tomorrow's show, no one sleeps, everyone's laughing and talking at once: What the hell just _happened_?

"The next night at a regular stage show, we got the same reaction," Merle told a journalist in June 1970. "'Okie' certainly started something for me, and it hasn't seemed to quit yet."

The Haggard camp knew they were on to something. Everywhere they went, every show, "Okie" did more than prompt enthusiastic applause. There was an unanticipated adulation racing through the crowds now, standing ovations that went on and on and sometimes left audience and band members alike teary-eyed. Merle had somehow stumbled upon a song that expressed previously inchoate fears, spoke out loud gripes and anxieties otherwise only whispered, and now people were using his song, they were using _him_ , to connect themselves to these larger concerns and to one another. It was absolutely thrilling, the kind of validation he'd craved all along. But it was scary, too.

They recorded the song at Capitol, mid-July. Merle took the recording to Nashville the next month for mastering (though not before overdubbing a nylon-string guitar track there that he dictated to Jerry Reed), and then "Okie from Muskogee" was released as a single on August 15. Merle and Fuzzy were so sure it was going to be a monster, they actually arranged to record what became the _Okie from Muskogee_ concert album, the one where Muskogee's mayor declares Merle an official Okie, on October 10th, one day _before_ the single even made the national country charts. A month later, the studio version of "Okie" was #1. A month passed, and it was still #1.

Later, a far more aggressive, even hostile, version of "Okie," cut live and cocksure, the audience clapping time and Rebel Yelling its approval, got a fair amount of airplay. On that one, Merle punctuated the final "We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse" with an angry " _By Golly!_ " The studio version that became the hit, though, is an altogether different affair, quiet and acoustic and with a harmony group ooh-ooh-ing us through chord changes. James Burton tickles the single to life on acoustic, Ronnie Tutt brushes time and provides nary a fill. For his part, Merle sings quietly, prettily really, while Roy Nichols and pianist Glen Hardin pick and plunk their way through an arrangement that calls to mind summer breezes and trickling brooks. The arrangement hinted at the song's implicit antagonism between big city and small town, but only subtly. If anything, the "Okie from Muskogee" single sounds like a Folk Revival leftover. Heard today, it's hard to believe such a gentle, delicate record could've pissed off anybody, but it did. No way does it sound like it could empower anyone. But it did.

Haggard claimed then, as now, that "Okie" was a joke, or that it began as one anyway. His lyrical choices back him up. The song's first line—"We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee"—doesn't reflect Merle's personal taste in intoxicants; he told one reporter in the early Seventies that Muskogee was about the _only_ place he didn't smoke pot. More to the point, the antiquated "pitching woo" is cornball even for country music; the decidedly un-Haggard-ish phrase "manly footwear" just has to be deliberately farcical; and since when did Merle, a longtime disdainer of authority figures, give a shit about college deans? All of that, combined with Merle's pretty but uncharacteristically flat reading of the lyric—not a whiff of anger—suggest that he was joking, to some degree, when he wrote the song. It's worth noting, though, that if "Okie" is a Generation Gap–inspired novelty, it's one that pokes fun not at the kids but at the fuddy-duddy citizens of Muskogee. "We like living right and being free," after all, is a parody of patriotic provincialism if ever there was one. In small towns like Muskogee, the song tells us, _being free_ is equated with a version of conformity called _living right_. Anyone who disobeys the rules of right living, or who dares challenge the authority of those who declare and enforce the rules, is not exercising freedom but threatening its existence. Haggard, who had spent so much of his life fleeing just such "civilizing" attitudes, would've appreciated the irony, could've conceived the line as a joke: If you're coerced to live by your neighbor's definition of "free," then "free" is one thing you ain't. What the hippies do in the song, meanwhile, is just what hippies do. Hippie behavior is so obviously _wrong_ , so plainly _not_ living right, that jokes at its expense are neither needed nor attempted.

Which is why Merle's audience didn't take "Okie" as a joke, let alone a joke on themselves. Haggard released the song into an America that seemed, depending upon one's point of view, on the verge of a new age or about to explode. On October 10th and 11th, the very moment "Okie from Muskogee" was debuting on the country charts and the same weekend _Live inMuskogee_ was recorded, the Weathermen waged Days of Rage in Chicago. The following week saw the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, two million mostly young Americans holding protests around the nation to stop the fighting. The week after that found Merle presenting The Other Side on _Music Scene_. "Okie" crossed over pop the same week to #91 on the Hot 100, only a few spots behind "Tonight I'll Be Staying Here with You" and just ahead of "Ballad of Easy Rider," from Haggard fans Bob Dylan and the Byrds, respectively.

It was unlikely many of Merle's rock fans were fans of _this_ single, though, and Merle knew it. In May 1970, in possibly his first nationally published interview in the wake of "Okie from Muskogee," _Rolling Stone_ 's John Grissim asked Merle if he had given any consideration to how the song might impact his image. Merle replied that, yes, he'd given it quite a bit of thought. "I'm thinking possibly there'll be a bad taste left with a certain class of people . . . ," he explained. "I'm thinking possibly here of hippies—not hip type people—but these barefooted bums walking around. That's my definition in the song."

That alone would have left an unpleasant taste in the mouths of _Rolling Stone_ readers, but Merle couldn't leave it alone:

What I don't understand is where did they all come from? We didn't have 'em ten years ago. I don't know what they done back then. . . . I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like. . . . What do they have to offer humanity?

Of course, what Merle had been doing ten years ago was time.

Merle warmed to the topic again the following month, for trade publication _Coast FM & Fine Arts_:

Some of the hippies have good minds, but I don't believe in filth and some of the other things they seem to represent sometimes. I'm not against long hair; I might decide to wear my hair long next week. I have nothing against long hair as long as there's nothing growing in it.

And this from a 1973 profile in _Penthouse_ :

It's like the words of the song. We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy. _Shaggy_. That's the thing. Shaggy means dirty. Right? Ain't that whut it means?

None of which sounded very jokey.

This isn't to suggest the song didn't begin as a joke, or that Haggard didn't intend it seriously, or that the truth is one or the other. What _did_ "Okie" mean? People used it all sorts of ways; as Merle observed a few years later, "There are about 18 different meanings in that song." So was "Okie from Muskogee" a joke, as he explained from the beginning? Or was it, as he also claimed, an endorsement of small-town values in response to countercultural threats? If it was a joke, was it mocking the freaks or tweaking the yokels? Was that damn song meant to be sung with your tongue in your cheek or with your hand over your heart?

Yes.

Not all of the conflicts of the Muskogee Moment were as trivial as hippie hygiene or as seemingly quaint as the Generation Gap. Indeed, as the Sixties slouched toward its denouement in the first half of the Seventies, and with the Civil Rights Movement having long since split into integrationist and black-nationalist camps, America was discovering class, specifically its _white_ working class. This was a rediscovery, of a sort, a late-twentieth-century reminder that the common folk depicted in the works of John Steinbeck, Woody Guthrie, and Dorothea Lange were still with us, still struggling.

But what a difference thirty years made. _All in the Family_ made its television debut in January 1971, offering up Archie Bunker as a kinder, goofier version of the working-class slob presented in the homicidal _Joe_ , a film out the previous summer. John Updike's _Rabbit Redux_ , about a printing plant employee who doesn't understand the crazy world he's living in and who echoes the guy in Merle's "Fightin' Side of Me" when he avows "I love my country and can't stand to have it knocked," was a 1972 finalist for the National Book Award. A rash of news stories began to appear, as well, fretting over the Troubled Americans (a _Newsweek_ "Special Report on the White Majority"), over the Middle Americans ( _Time_ 's "Man and Woman of the Year" for 1969), over white blue-collar workers as alienated as ever but pissed off like never before. In April, Peter Hamill published "The Revolt of the White Lower Middle Class," a prescient and widely discussed _New York_ piece that warned something must be done about "the growing alienation and paranoia of these people." If not, "[t]he next round of race riots might not be between people and property, but between people and people."

A representative sample:

"I'm going out of my mind," an ironworker friend . . . told me. "I work my ass off. But I can't make it. I come home at the end of the week, I start paying bills, I give my wife some money for food. And there's nothin' left. They take $65 a week out of my pay. I have to come up with $90 a month rent. But every time I turn around, one of the kids needs shoes or a dress or something for school. And then I pick up the paper and read about a million people on welfare in New York or some spades rioting in some college or some fat welfare bitch demanding—you know, not askin', _demanding_ —a credit card at Korvette's [department store]. . . . I _work_ for a livin' and _I_ can't get a credit card at Korvette's. . . . You see that and you want to go out and strangle someone."

Ladies and Gentlemen . . . The Other Side.

That same month, Merle's latest single seemed to diagnose Hamill's ironworker as suffering from what it called "Workin' Man Blues." Richard Nixon called it a political opportunity. When he read "The Revolt of the White Lower Middle Class," the president saw his chance to win over those members of the white working class who _liked living right and being free_ , but who were seeing their wages stagnate or decline; who were sick to death of Moratoriums and Days of Rage, disgusted by hippies, and fed up with sneering high-class liberal elites ( _Another class of people put us somewhere just below . . ._ ); and who harbored racial resentments that the decade's civil rights advances had only inflamed. That those resentments now had to be expressed in code like _I ain't never been on welfare_ was both a sign of progress and a mile-marker for how far there was to go.

A study Nixon ordered in the new year, "The Problem of the Blue Collar Worker," confirmed that the white working stiffs Nixon particularly wanted to woo felt taken advantage of, abused, neglected. Blacks had civil rights, the hippies had their marches, but who spoke for _them_? Who even remembered them? Nixon determined that he would. Or, closer to true, he would make sure they _felt_ remembered.

On November 3, two days after "Okie" cracked the pop Hot 100, Nixon delivered his famous Pat Buchanan–penned "Silent Majority" speech: "So, tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans, I ask for your support," he read, effectively stoking grievances already smoldering within so many current Merle Haggard fans and within countless new ones the singer was, if only temporarily, about to acquire.

" _They_ were loud. _You_ were quiet" is Perlstein's translation of the emotional hook to Nixon's Silent Majority pitch:

_They_ proclaimed their virtue. _You_ , simply, lived virtuously. Thus Nixon made political capital of a certain experience of humiliation; the humiliation of having to defend values that seemed to you self-evident, then finding you had no words to defend them, precisely because they seemed so self-evident. Nixon gave you the words.

Now, thanks to "Okie from Muskogee," so had Merle Haggard, and whether he'd meant to or not.

**"Irma Jackson," 1969**

Merle headed into Capitol Studios to record a follow-up single as "Okie from Muskogee" was still a week away from topping _Billboard_ 's Country Singles chart, in early November. This was "Irma Jackson." "Of all the songs I've written, this may be my favorite," Merle would say a few years later, "because it tells it like it is." Quite a statement, considering the competition, but listen to "Irma Jackson" and you understand the appeal. The song has a universal theme—individual freedom, sought and crushed—represented by our nation's great manifestation of that theme—white supremacy and the legacy of Jim Crow—all in a compact narrative that speaks to its moment. Only two years after the Supreme Court had declared laws prohibiting interracial marriage to be unconstitutional, "Irma Jackson" shows us something all but unheard of in country music, and rare even in pop: a black woman and a white man in love.

Merle got the idea for the song after seeing an in-flight presentation of _Guess Who's Coming to Dinner_ , though it's telling that the love story Merle invents lacks the happy ending of Stanley Kramer's 1967 movie. "Irma Jackson," he told Michael Ochs that spring, was about "a plantation-owner's son falling for one of the colored help":

They played together, went to school together, nobody paid any attention to it until they became somewhat of age. They actually fell into a true, deep love. . . . they were intelligent people and realized that their families were different, and . . . they decided to sever, more out of respect for their families than society. . . . I thought it was a beautiful story.

This may be the backstory Merle imagined, but "Irma" makes no mention of a "plantation" or "colored help" or disapproving parents. And he thinks the story is beautiful, I take it, not because it's inspirational or romantic, but because, as he explained later, its tragic scenario tells it like it is. "If my loving Irma Jackson is a sin," Merle nearly wails on the record, "then I don't understand this crazy world we're living in." Faced with "this crazy world we're living in"—Merle tries to spit the line from his mouth, fails, swallows the "in"—his narrator can only conclude that "There's a mighty wall between us standing high," a wall that cannot be scaled, just as the world, crazy or not, can't be defeated or even engaged in battle. "I'd love to shout my feelings from a mountain high, and tell her that I love her and will until I die," Merle sings. He breathes that "her" like a gentle kiss, that "die" like a longer one, so you believe him that he has love to shout about. But he croons quietly nonetheless, certain as he is of the world's reply and resigned to it. "A mighty wall between us, standing high," he repeats, dipping from his well of The-World-Is-a-Prison imagery. "And that's why Irma Jackson can't be mine."

It's also why "Irma Jackson" isn't the liberal counterweight to "Okie" and other conservative Haggard songs it's regularly made out to be. The song does depict an interracial couple in love, no small thing, even today, but it also strongly implies that such relationships are bound to fail, their lovers born to lose. So when Irma decides to go away, Merle vows he'll love her forever but lets her go. "I guess it's right that she alone should have the final say," he concludes. It apparently doesn't occur to him he could go with her.

Merle wanted "Irma" to be his next single, but it didn't happen. The reason repeated through the years is that Capitol wouldn't put it out, but that's never struck me as entirely plausible.

Merle had already proven he had the power to make the music he wanted in the style he wanted. Earlier that year, Capitol had already released _Same Train, a Different Time_ , the double tribute album to a forty-years-dead singer most people had barely heard of and that had Merle delivering little lectures between the tracks. After "Okie," Merle wielded even greater creative control, and used it. Witness 1971's _Land of Many Churches_ , surely one of the least commercial projects ever realized by a mainstream country act: Another double album of what amounted to glorified field recordings cut in four different churches and including minister introductions and sermons. And don't forget that between _Same Train_ and _Many Churches_ came Merle's Bob Wills album, another tribute to an out-of-favor artist and style that didn't exactly drip with commercial potential. And yet Capitol refused its number one cash-cow country star . . . a seven-inch single?

What seems likely isn't that Merle was denied but that he was persuaded by Nelson and Capitol that "Irma" was a bad idea. Merle, understandably anxious about the song's subject matter and just then learning of the press's tendency to demand further comment on politically minded radio hits, probably didn't need his arm twisted. "People are narrow-minded," he told the _Wall Street Journal_ at the time. "Down South, they might have called me a nigger lover." Indeed, they might have, and not only down South. All the more reason, one might imagine, for this instinctively contrarian artist to dig in his heels and reaffirm his commitment to Ms. Jackson. Instead: _They might've called me a nigger lover_. This explanation, notice, finds Haggard neither endorsing nor condemning the racism behind that slur, but it does show him accepting it. That, it seems, is why "Irma Jackson" couldn't be his next single. It was a real-life outcome that mirrored the shelved relationship in the song itself.

What if Merle _had_ followed "Okie from Muskogee" with "Irma Jackson"?

According to music journalist Daniel Cooper, Merle called Johnny Cash and played the song for his friend over the phone. "It's a smash!" Cash told him. I suspect Johnny was right. "Irma" would've been a hit, a big one, if it had been released, right then: the TV appearances; the covers of his songs by a wide variety of acts; the news coverage; the movie tie-ins; and all of it compounded by the crossover controversy surrounding "Okie from Muskogee." At the dawn of the Seventies, Merle Haggard was poised to become a major star of the pop-but-still-country sort Cash himself was then perfecting.

"Irma" would have sounded great on Top 40 radio, too. Its pulsing rhythm and swollen-hearted electric-meets-acoustic arrangement, its high-and-haunting female harmony shouting "Amen" to Merle's confusion and punctuating one of the more infectious melodies this melody-master ever wrote—"Irma" would've fit comfortably between early 1970 singles like CCR's "Who'll Stop the Rain," say, and Brook Benton's "Rainy Night in Georgia." And "Irma" wasn't just topical. Like "Okie," it was ambiguous enough to allow listeners to hear what they wanted: _See, prejudice is terrible_ or, _See, I knew those relationships couldn't work_. In Cash's words, "Irma" could've been a smash.

"Ken Nelson never interfered with my music," Merle told me when I asked him about "Irma Jackson" in 2001. "But this _one time_ he came out and said, 'Merle . . . I don't believe the world is ready for this yet.' . . . And he may have been right. I might've canceled out where I was headed in my career." I suspect this is right too, though maybe not the way Merle meant it. In 1970, it would have taken a song declaring his love for Jane Fonda to have significantly diminished Haggard's country appeal. Country stardom was where he already was. Where Merle was headed in his career was _pop_ stardom.

The single that replaced "Irma" put an end to that.

**His Fightin' Side**

"The Fightin' Side of Me," the last-minute replacement for "Irma Jackson," let Merle once again woo a white, square, blue-collar, and small-town-identifying demographic. It was cut a couple of days before Christmas 1969, with a lineup of mostly L.A. session pros serving as studio Strangers, and was released at the beginning of February as "Muskogee" slipped from the charts. By the middle of March, it had hit #1, just like Merle's three previous singles—"Hungry Eyes," "Workin' Man Blues," and "Okie from Muskogee"—and eight of his last ten, all in just three years.

"Okie from Muskogee" and "The Fightin' Side of Me" have rightly been lumped together ever since. The overwhelming success of the former, after all, and not only at the cash register, made some sort of sequel more or less inevitable. Merle admitted as much that Valentine's Day during a concert at Philadelphia's Civic Center, a performance that became Haggard's next album, _The Fightin' Side of Me_ , itself an attempt to capitalize on the previous year's also-live, and platinum-selling, _Okie from Muskogee_. In Philly that evening, as applause for "Okie" died away, Merle introduced "a brand-new record" (it had charted only the week before) "that's, uh, much on the same thought. We hope that you like it as much as you did 'Muskogee.'"

"The Fightin' Side of Me" was very much along the same lines as "Okie." But it was also a different sort of song—and a damn near unprecedented one, at least as far as country music went. The most obvious difference was in tone. Where "Okie" had condescended to any and all listeners, and done so with enough aw-shucks humor and good old-fashioned irony to leave it at least a slightly open question as to just who was being condescended to, "The Fightin' Side of Me" addressed one audience by unambiguously laying into another. "Okie" had been playful and at least partially in jest where "Fightin' Side" sounded mad as hell. The difference was between "I'm proud . . ." and "I'm not gonna take it anymore."

"Fightin' Side" took the grievances "Okie" had revealed and doubled down on them. We'd say today that it throws red meat to the base; it's an attack ad with melody. There are real Americans who love this land just the way it is, Merle's song insists. And then there are those side-switching, blame-America-first types:

_People talkin' bad about the way we have to live here in this country_ ,

_Harpin' on the wars we fight, gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be . . ._

The way we _have_ to live. Yet the hippies "preach about some other way of living."

"Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'," Merle growls. "When you're runnin' down my country, hoss, you're walkin' on the fightin' side of me."

This was less than two months after the infamous Altamont Free Concert and only three months before Kent State. It was a year after some redneck shotgunned that hippie Captain America at the end of _Easy Rider_ , and a year before San Francisco's _Dirty Harry_ snarled, "Do [you] feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?" at a black bank robber. "I read about some squirrelly guy who claims that he just don't believe in fightin'," Merle sneers, disbelieving. That "claim" is priceless, as subtly sharp in its way as, barely half a year after the Stonewall riots, that "squirrelly guy" is bullying.

The end of the Sixties and the start of the backlash Seventies are now forty years in the rearview, but like any number of Muskogee Moment artifacts, "The Fightin' Side of Me" emotes as familiarly today as if it had been released last month, or tomorrow. If you catch Merle's drift, if you place yourself to one side of the line he draws, you can feel attacked, all these years later, as if Merle's just poked you hard in the chest and dared you to do something about it. On the other hand, if you place yourself on The Other Side, if you feel like you belong on the side of the song, you may hear Merle's carping and suddenly stand up a little straighter, feel a charge that someone's finally saying it like you're feeling it. You might feel like it's _you_ poking someone in the chest.

"Fightin' Side" can still stop you in your tracks, in part, because it's so sonically gripping. It's a great record, far more rocking and pop-inclined than "Okie," and nearly as catchy. James Burton launches the studio version with a clarion Fender lick that would sound right at home on a Creedence Clearwater track. Bassist Chuck Berghofer enters next, playing a burbling, counting-to-three Fender bass lick that's reminiscent of the indelible double bass part he'd played a few years earlier on Nancy Sinatra's Lee Hazelwood–produced "These Boots Are Made for Walking." Sam Goldstein (the year before, he'd backed the Flying Burrito Brothers on "Wheels") keeps impatient time. "The Fightin' Side of Me," like "Workin' Man Blues" before it, is dance music for a bar fight in some suburban tavern where the Wurlitzer is as crowded with Rock 'n' Soul records as Country & Western discs. Its rocking rhythms incite Merle onward and second his threats, while Burton's Fender keeps showily flexing its muscles, but saving its strength, too, should the song's title need making good on after all.

The Philadelphia version's even more charged. Its accelerated pace and the call-and-response electricity of its boisterous arena crowd leave that concluding key change sounding like liftoff. Roy Nichols swaggers the lick on this version, and Dennis Hromek's jeering bass—flipping off the hippies, flicking them in their foreheads, laughing—sounds full-on Dixie fried. _All the squares go home?_ Like hell.

"Fightin' Side," then as now, is reactionary in any number of ugly ways. But it was part of something new, as well, and something commonplace ever since. Not the borrowing from rock 'n' roll. Country music had been doing that for as long as there had been a rock 'n' roll to cop, but Haggard took that appropriation several steps further. "The Fightin' Side of Me" deploys _rock 'n' roll_ sounds to assert, with great defiance and without contradiction, that it is by-golly _country_ to the core. Haggard was onto something else, too. Country musicians had long proclaimed collective identities—southern, rural, down-home and down-and-out, patriotic—but these claims to distinction were hardly threatening and determinedly apolitical. "Okie" and, especially, "Fightin' Side" were another matter. For the first time, these Haggard hits presented the country audience to itself as an explicitly political grouping. In "Okie" and "Fightin' Side," and in countless country radio hits since, the country audience is conceived not only as distinct from other groups, but in contemptuous opposition to them. Its members were not merely patriotic, but true Americans, defending their values from derision and assault. This new sense of class consciousness was extremely limited, not to mention limiting, but it was empowering for all that. Haggard expressed it best simply by shouting to the world that such a demographic existed at all and by giving the shout a name.

Pride.

"Fightin' Side" had the music to be an even bigger hit than "Okie" had been, but its words wouldn't let it. This isn't to say Merle's lyrics were entirely indifferent to pop potential. He was articulating grievances well known today, but was speaking in the commercial language of his day. Since the early 1960s, for instance, Americans had seen a print and television ad campaign for Tareyton cigarettes: a man or woman sporting a shiner and smoking a Tareyton, with the catchphrase "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch." The slogan became so well known it was recycled by everyone from the Goldwater Girls on the Right to, most famously, Thomas "TNT" Todd on the Left. (The civil rights activist's fierce interpolation of the cigarette slogan was sampled much later by Public Enemy to introduce their even fiercer "Fight the Power" in 1989: "Yet our best-trained, best-educated, best-equipped, best-prepared troops refuse to fight. Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switcccccccch . . . than fight!") Merle was playing with the Tareyton slogan when he magnanimously allowed, or at least agreed to tolerate, that the protesters had freedom of thought and expression just as he did: "I don't mind 'em switching sides and standin' up for things that they believe in." But, if that free speech was critical of the United States, he cautioned, then they could invariably expect to feel the wrath of his "fightin' side." Either that or they could just shut the hell up. Or move.

In 2003, the harpin'-on-the-wars-we-fight Dixie Chicks would be infamously advised to "shut up and sing"—and Merle came to their defense! But in 1970, Merle offered Vietnam protesters what amounted to the same advice: "If you don't love it, leave it." The precise origins of that expression are unclear, though it was certainly in circulation (Walter Winchell had speed-read something similar during World War II) well before Merle Haggard set it to music. After "Fightin' Side," it entered the zeitgeist.

On May 4th, with "Fightin' Side" still a week from sliding off the national country charts, National Guardsmen shot and killed four young people, and wounded nine others, following a campus protest at Kent State University against the invasion of Cambodia. Responses to the tragedy ran overwhelmingly in favor of the Guard. On May 8th, in New York City, Mayor John Lindsay ordered all city flags lowered to half-mast in memory of the Kent State victims, while downtown that morning maybe a thousand college kids sat applauding speeches calling for peace. Just before noon, according to the _New York Times_ , "a large group of construction workers, most of them wearing . . . orange and yellow hard hats, descended on Wall Street from four directions . . . marching behind a cluster of American flags." The Hard Hats, as they became known almost on the spot, pulled hammers, pliers, and other tools of their trades from the fronts of their overalls and began to beat, kick, and punch the protesters. As many as eighty were injured, while the Hard Hats, many from the nearly finished World Trade Center nearby, chanted, "All the way, USA" and "Love it or leave it." The following week, two thousand Hard Hats stomped angrily about the financial district, shouting slanders and carrying signs, mostly saying a very specific version of hurray for our side: "America: Love It or Leave It."

The Hard Hats' public language lacked logic—"Love it or leave it" is a textbook example of "False Dilemma"—but it conveyed absolute emotional clarity. Most working stiffs who sat down, after another day, another dollar, to watch developments on the evening news would've never joined even a peaceful protest—who could afford the time off? But the Hard Hats stood out because they shoved back: against women yapping on about equal rights; against blacks and other minorities who wouldn't shut up either (and after all they'd been given!); against homosexuals who all of a sudden thought they had rights too; against kids who'd been handed everything on a silver platter and couldn't stop complaining about it; against anyone and everyone who wanted something they didn't have coming, who wanted that something for nothing, and who now seemed prepared to get it by helping themselves to what normal people had already earned for themselves fair and square. This was freedom as a zero-sum game.

Nixon, eager to shore up support for his reelection among the white working-class voters who'd voted solidly Democratic for decades, spotted a chance. Before the month was out, representatives of the AFL-CIO and the International Longshoremen's Association had awarded him with an honorary hard hat, "a symbol, along with our great flag, for freedom and patriotism to our beloved country." To help win away similar voters from George Wallace down south and out west, the president also proclaimed October "Country Music Month," and in 1972, the Country Music Association returned the favor, officially signing on to the reelection cause and presenting Nixon a personalized album. _Thank You, Mr. President_ was narrated by Haggard's fellow Capitol recording artist Tex Ritter ("Country music, which in reality is the voice of your Silent Majority . . ."), and the set also included Johnny Horton's 1959 all-charts smash "The Battle of New Orleans," Bill Anderson's 1961 hit "Po' Folks" (a paean to the character-building importance of growing up poor, not to be confused with _being_ poor, _now_ , and maybe being on welfare as a result), and a rousing, slyly funky singalong version of "Okie from Muskogee" pulled from _The Fightin' Side of Me_.

"We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse. _By golly!_ "

During the Muskogee Moment, rock became associated with protest in the popular imagination, a perception that remains entrenched. But it's also true that, save for Country Joe McDonald's "Fixin' to Die Rag," or hits like CCR's "Fortunate Son" or Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's "Ohio," the rock scene proper produced surprisingly few explicitly political protest songs. Country radio, by contrast, sounded for a while there like a musical version of a Hard Hat rally, grudgingly behind the war but wholeheartedly against the protesters.

Country music had always had something of a sentimental side when it came to war. In the decades before Haggard showed up, this was almost entirely of the flag-saluting and morale-inspiring type, as in the World War II–era hits "There's a Star-Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere" by Elton Britt and "Stars and Stripes on Iwo Jima" by Bob Wills, with Tommy Duncan singing lead. These were hand-over-heart patriotic. They took consensus for granted, but weren't hawkish or belligerent.

More common in country music were songs that confronted war not so much patriotically as personally. Southerners, both pre- and postdiaspora, have long served disproportionately in the military. It makes sense the people doing so much of the fighting and dying would crave songs reflecting that experience, so a number of now-classic country records—Gene Autry's "At Mail Call Today," for instance, or Floyd Tillman's "Each Night at Nine" or Bakersfield's own "Dear John"—have expressed the homesickness of soldiers overseas. Far and away, though, country music's soundtrack to war has offered condolences to those mourning their dead. The Father of Country Music's very first recording was just such a record, "The Soldier's Sweetheart," and from Ernest Tubb's World War II–era "The Soldier's Last Letter" to the Dixie Chicks' Iraq War hit "Travelin' Soldier," country music has cried over war's fatal consequences in almost exclusively individual terms. None of the country songs above could be fairly characterized as for their respective wars, but each of them is indisputably against dead soldiers.

Country music's apolitical posture toward war began to erode in the middle 1960s, as the United States, via troop escalations and the initiation of the bombing campaigns called Operation Rolling Thunder, initiated so-called Americanization of the Vietnam conflict. Johnny Wright led the way in late 1965 with "Hello Vietnam," a country #1 written by Tom T. Hall that defended the war in language that could have been quoting President Lyndon Johnson: "We must stop communism in that land or freedom will start slipping through our hands." The following year, songs about the personal costs of war still resonated. In "Dear Uncle Sam," Loretta Lynn pleaded that she needed her man much more than the Pentagon did. But 1966 also saw a new brand of country song dominating the charts, one that stepped beyond expressing loss or patriotism in favor of unequivocally supporting the war in Vietnam, or at least—it amounts to the same thing—that war's absolute necessity. Sgt. Barry Sadler's "The Ballad of the Green Berets," a major country radio hit, framed Vietnam fatalities as almost purely national rather than individual losses. Dave Dudley, a macho baritone who with "Six Days on the Road" and "Truck Drivin' Son-of-a-Gun" had found great success in Nashville with a modified version of the Bakersfield Sound, was a key figure in this transition. His "What We're Fighting For," another Tom T. song and a top five single, shook its head and fist at simpleminded demonstrators. Dudley's follow-up single, the Kris Kristofferson–penned "Vietnam Blues," did the same, but was angry and bitter where the former was wearily resigned. As on Stonewall Jackson's "The Minute Men (Are Turning in Their Graves)," these 1966 hits struck an apocalyptic tone. Nothing less than American freedom was at stake in Southeast Asia: Dissenters were at best naïve and quite possibly traitorous.

All of this was in the air as Merle Haggard rose to country stardom, and it's this context that helps explain why his "Okie from Muskogee" and "The Fightin' Side of Me" might have been successful in the country market. But these hits did more than extend preexisting conditions. First of all, Haggard's music had the undeniable hooks, indelible imagery, and country-rock sound to take those concerns nationwide in a way the music of old squares like Dave Dudley and Johnny Wright most definitely didn't. What's more, his songs escalated hostilities from war over the war to full-scale Culture War. "Okie" and "Fightin' Side" weren't only about Vietnam, not then and certainly not in the years since. They were about hair and fashion, authority and hierarchy and tradition, about freedom. And they expressed an antielitist class loyalty bordering on the clannish.

More immediately, "Muskogee" and its infamous follow-up were catalysts for several dozen like-minded country records, starting most obviously with the couple of dozen big-time country stars who raced to lay down their own versions of "Workin' Man Blues" (Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Louvin, etc.), "Okie" (Conway Twitty, Jeannie C. Riley), "Fightin' Side" (George Jones, Jeannie Seely), or, in the case of Johnny Cash's little brother Tommy, all three. Haggard's language inspired records like Rusty Adams's "Hippie from Mississippi," whose folks are so ashamed they've changed their name, and Ernest Tubbs's "It's America (Love It or Leave It)." Merle's themes and tone inspired many more hits, including a pair of top ten recitations from 1970: the earnest "Where Have All Our Heroes Gone," in which Bill Anderson gets sick to his stomach about the radicals admired by the "Now Generation," and the wacky "Welfare Cadillac," in which Guy Drake plays a hillbilly freeloader who has a falling-down shack but still manages to drive a new car.

(Haggard's "Okie from Muskogee" also inspired a number of answer songs from a counterculture perspective: Big Brother and the Holding Company recorded "I'll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle" in 1970; the Youngbloods had "Hippie from Olema No. 5" in 1971; David Peel cut "The Hippy from New York City" in 1972; and Chinga Chavin had "Asshole from El Paso" in 1976.)

But country radio in the early Seventies was less monolithic toward the war than usually remembered. Merle session hand Glen Campbell had "Galveston," a countrypolitan smash that instead of taking a stand on the war pictured a kid soldier "so afraid of dying." Johnny Cash had something for everyone, supporting the troops in "Singing in Vietnam Talking Blues," while allowing in "What Is Truth?" that maybe the younger generation had a point. His marvelously self-mythologizing "The Man in Black" worked both sides of the street at once, protesting the war in one line, protesting the protesters in the next, but dressed for mourning either way: "Each week we lose a hundred fine young men!"

Ambivalence and confusion were as prominent among country emotions during the Muskogee Moment as was certainty. People often hold tightly to a position because it makes them feel less helpless than it would to embrace conflicted emotions wholeheartedly—and to feel doubly at sea as a result. "Okie from Muskogee" had toed a line in the dirt and cultivated home soil. "The Fightin' Side of Me" had cast stones across the divide. But Haggard began to bridle under his new persona. He hated the way left-leaning rock fans figured he was a warmonger and bigot: One editorial writer called him "the Spiro Agnew of music," a designation bound to give any artist second thoughts, and peace protesters were picketing some of his shows. He disliked the assumptions many country fans made about his politics, too. In 1972, the George Wallace campaign approached Merle to join up.

He passed, and began working on a song with room to move. He cut it in August, then toyed with the lyrics and tried again a year later, punching up the chorus with harmonies from Bonnie Owens. But "Somewhere In Between" (similar name, different song from 1967's "Somewhere Between") was a dud. It was didactic and vague where "Okie" was farcical and specific, and it was measured and abstract where "Fightin' Side" was animated and ready to rumble. Strike three was that it wasn't even very catchy. Merle moved on.

"I haven't heard an answer that'll change things overnight," Haggard sang in the unreleased recordings. "That's one thing I know for sure is right," he continued, a confession sure to please no one.

_I stand somewhere between divided wings_

_The liberal left, the narrow right, and the young of 17_

_And I'm not too old to understand the young who disagree_

_It leaves me standing somewhere in between_

And there he was, cornered again.

**He'd Rather Be Gone**

Conventional wisdom has it that Haggard reacted to controversy by fleeing his fightin' side almost as quickly as he'd stepped in it and running as fast as he could into new apolitical work. After a pair of live albums that had become flashpoints in the cultural present, Haggard's next album was going to be all about the music—and music from the past to boot, specifically the swinging sounds of Merle's boyhood hero, Bob Wills.

This bit of Haggard lore isn't quite right for a couple of reasons, the most obvious being that the time line doesn't work. The Wills project, inspired partly by the bandleader's 1968 induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, was conceived before "Okie" was recorded, was well into the planning stages before "Fightin' Side" made the charts, and was already in the can four months by the time the live _Fightin' Side_ album was released. When Merle and the Strangers played that concert on Valentine's Day 1970, they included Wills favorite "Corrine, Corrina" in anticipation of sessions already scheduled for April.

As to being about the music of the past, _A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (Or My Salute to Bob Wills)_ can only plead guilty as charged. Like its tribute-paying predecessor, _Same Train, a Different Time_ , the Wills set was part love letter, part history lesson. Merle's narrated preface links the projects explicitly: "About the time the late and great Jimmie Rodgers' career came to an end, another young fellow by the name of Bob Wills was making preparations unknowingly to become a legend in his own time." Unlike the earlier record, which fused Rodgers's old songs to the Strangers' modern sound, _Best Damn Fiddle Player_ isn't interested in updating its material. It's more like _Same Train, Same Sound_.

To get the sound right, Haggard enlisted several former Playboys, fiddler Johnny Gimble and electric mandolin man Tiny Moore among them. Wills was in the hospital at the time, but Merle made up for his absence by visiting him for advice and by teaching himself to play the fiddle—in just a few months, too, an achievement only slightly mitigated by the head start he'd been given by childhood violin lessons. As Merle explained at its start, the album was an attempt "to turn back the pages of time and recapture some of the great sounds of the legendary Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys."

Wills and the Playboys were stars up and down the San Joaquin Valley when Merle was a boy. Haggard's overly enthusiastic mouthful of an album title aside, Wills usually wasn't even the best fiddler in his own band, let alone the world, but he was a pretty damn good one. He was a first-rate songwriter, too, with an ear for melodies that stick in your head and stay stuck. Wills had a fine voice, strong and bluesy and not averse to showmanship (his idols were Queen of the Blues Bessie Smith and minstrel Emmett Miller), and he was an accomplished bandleader—an expert self-promoter, a savvy entrepreneur, and keen talent scout. The self-evident boss even when he wasn't the center of attention, Wills was a charismatic front man, chomping his cigar, twirling his bow like a baton, tossing off jive interjections, and calling out his musicians for solos. His constant stream of chatter (and in particular his nearly incessant Ah-haaaaaa's) still sets detractors' teeth on edge, but for his Okie fan base, it was all key to what made Bob so attractive. Wills was one of them, a hell of a regular guy, feeling his pain, but ironic and on top of it—a man's man. The Playboys moved the crowd, but Bob Wills was the show, and with sense enough to stay out of singer Tommy Duncan's way on the slow ones.

Judged by its stated standards—the album's a "salute to Bob Wills" and means to "recapture" his sound— _The Best Damn Fiddle Player_ is a success. As a Merle Haggard album, it's a disappointment. The album's most charming quality, its attention to authentic period detail, is a built-in limitation it never entirely transcends. Merle doesn't merely throw in intros and asides à la Wills; he quotes Bob's patter straight off the old 78s, even mimics his voice. "I'm gonna try to do Tommy Duncan's part," Merle says on "Misery," by which he means Duncan's part exactly. He's doing impersonations again, in other words, except what in concert was a diverting interlude is here the whole gig. Several times, the album replicates original Playboys arrangements so exactly that Wills's sides and Haggard's remakes are exactly the same length or off by only a second or two.

My favorite moment comes in "Stay a Little Longer." Merle and his Playboy-augmented Strangers are again expertly playing the record, but then Roy Nichols, who'd been busy doubling Tiny Moore's mandolin on his electric guitar just as it had been doubled on disc a quarter century before, suddenly falls into playing that state-of-the-art Elvisy rhythm lick from "Workin' Man Blues." Instantly, the history lesson jolts into breaking news, a hint of what might have been if Merle had chosen to honor Wills the way he had the Singing Brakeman. _The Best Damn Fiddle Player_ is retro bordering on vintage, but when Nichols quotes Haggard's catalogue, retro becomes traditional, connects new to old, and needs both. This only lasts a split second, though, a good musical joke, but that's all. "Heeey," Merle mock-warns, sending Nichols back to school.

Still, in that brief moment is a glimpse of where Haggard would take his music. After the Wills tribute, Merle began to highlight his Strangers more than ever, pointing them out by name on record and encouraging them to stretch out and improvise on the road, like the country-jazz-loving Texas Playboys would have done it but in the Strangers' own style. He soon began experimenting with horns, too, and enlisted some old Playboys—Gimble and Moore, especially—as official Strangers for a time on tour and in the studio. The album mostly makes you eager to revisit the originals, but it let Merle imagine options for himself.

Of course, getting folks to check out Bob Wills was another of the album's intentions—and another success. _The Best Damn Fiddle Player_ prompted a western swing revival, sending younger musicians—many of them of the noticeably long-haired type, like Asleep at the Wheel and Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen—back to modernize the old sounds of Wills, Milton Brown, and other legends of what otherwise might have been a dead genre. Western swing has played a role in most every country development since and has helped keep dance music alive in the genre, as well. Ironic, huh, that the most backward-looking Haggard album would turn out to be among his most prescient? Or rather it would be ironic if Haggard hadn't been self-consciously employing the past to work out his future all along.

There were no singles from the Wills project. Merle's radio follow-up to "Fightin' Side of Me" was "Street Singer," a hot acoustic blues pulled from the Strangers' second instrumental album, _Introducing My Friends the Strangers_ , on which Merle said nothing more polemical than "Hey, hey," and "Blow my mind one more time!" But in April 1971, Merle's next proper solo album, called _Hag_ , marked a return to the state-of-the-art country-rockin' country he'd been developing since "Sing Me Back Home." It was also the most sustained and closest-to-coherent political statement of his career. Featuring some of his finest songs, split about evenly between his tender and fightin' sides, and some of his most evocative singing, it's also among the half-dozen best of his career.

The world Hag portrays on _Hag_ is one teetering on the brink. From atop some middle-American watchtower, Merle delivers a nearly despairing state of the union. "The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound, and our city streets are filled with angry men," he observes wearily on "Jesus, Take a Hold" as Roy Nichols sounds the alarm on harmonica and guitar. "Destruction seems to be the current trend. This world has never been in the awful shape it's in!" Merle's characters here have it at least as bad as their nation, nursing insults, mourning losses, bracing for failure and pain to come. On the desolate "Shelly's Winter Love," the title character comes and goes like the seasons, leaving Merle cold and depressed all year 'round: "She'll leave when love has thawed the winter ground," he predicts as pianist Glen Hardin plays an icy drip, drip, drip. On Dave Kirby's "Sidewalks of Chicago," Merle is homeless, dissolute, and distilled. "If I buy the bread, I can't afford the wine," he sings, and the way he gives that last word the shakes, we know the wine's non-negotiable. On "If You've Got Time," Merle leans hard into his chorus's internal rhymes—"let me brace my heart, so I can face the part, that I've been dreading . . ."—while riding twin fiddles that feel like a melancholy chamber group. Halfway through the album, when an unaccountably buoyant Merle declares "I'm a Good Loser," we understand instantly that it's not out of sportsmanship; it's that lately he's had so much practice.

Each of these individual hurts spirals outward on _Hag_ , binding personal trouble to public issue. In "I've Done It All," Merle recalls that, in addition to picking his share of cotton and "driving one railroad spike," he's "been to Frisco wearin' regular clothes [and] felt them modern hippie folks starin' down their nose." On the clarion "I Can't Be Myself," Haggard boasts again of his rough and rowdy ways: "It's a way of mine to say just what I'm thinkin' and to do the things I really want to do." His woman wants to change him, though—to change the very parts of him of which he's most proud, in fact—and he can't allow that. "I can't be myself and be what pleases you," he claims, almost breaking into a beautiful blue yodel. The song's a testament to Merle's rugged individualism, but he makes it sound like Sartre: Hell is prison, and prison is other people wanting you to change.

_Hag_ begins with "Soldier's Last Letter." Originally a World War II–era hit for Ernest Tubb, Merle transforms it into a Vietnam hit simply by singing it in 1970. In the song, a mother excitedly reads a letter from a son stationed overseas, then realizes, rather implausibly, that he's died in action because the letter is unfinished. "Dear God," she prays, falling to her knees, "keep America free." Patriotic hokum, that, but it's also a kind of psychological realism: People understandably invest a great deal in the conviction that loved ones have sacrificed for a good cause, that they are heroic rather than merely dead. And it's that mother's fall to her knees, her tears and trembling hands, where Merle directs our focus. Merle's "Soldier's Last Letter" is musical testimony that, as Barbara Kingsolver has written, "every war is both won and lost and that loss is a pure, high note of anguish like a mother singing to an empty bed."

Near _Hag_ 's end is "The Farmer's Daughter," in which reverent and ragged acoustic guitar picking and Johnny Gimble's bittersweet fiddle evoke the setting: a ramshackle but candlelit country church that's about to host a wedding. A widowed farmer is hesitant to give away his daughter, his "one possession," to "that city boy from town." "His hair's a little longer than we're used to," Merle complains, and you figure you know where Merle's train of thought must be heading. But then something remarkable happens. Merle positions himself somewhere between, as he'd tried to put it earlier: His tribalism eases a bit, his tolerance blooms, and instead of feeling cornered, his world seems to expand. Gimble's fiddle leaps and swells, and Merle, knowing how dearly he loves and trusts his daughter, allows himself to be changed. This young man, Merle sings at the end, his heart breaking and mending all at once, "says he really loves the farmer's daughter."

And, more to the point: "I know the farmer's daughter loves the man."

_Hag_ was a #1 country album and boasted four hit singles, more than any album of his career to that point: "Soldier's Last Letter," "Jesus, Take a Hold," and "I Can't Be Myself" were #3 hits across the board, and the latter's flip, "Sidewalks of Chicago," received a lot of play too. These days, though, if people remember _Hag_ at all it's as one more example of what used to be called Nixon music, an opprobrium taking in everything from the cultishly clean-cut mass choir Up with People singing "Freedom Isn't Free" at the 1968 Republican convention ("You got to pay the price, you got to sacrifice, for your liberty") to Johnny Cash being asked to perform "Welfare Cadillac" and "Okie from Muskogee" at a White House performance in July 1972 (he declined) to Merle himself performing for Nixon the following spring: "I searched the faces in the crowd, hoping to find at least one that was interested in what I was doing," he wrote in _Sing Me Back Home_. "No luck."

Those connections are all fair enough, but when I listen to _Hag_ these days what leaps out at me is how it seems to be in deliberate conversation with _What's Going On_ , Marvin Gaye's album from the same year. It wasn't deliberate—again, the time line's wrong; Haggard's album came out the month before Gaye's—but the themes the albums address seem like family to one another, at times almost eerily. _Hag_ begins with a mother weeping for a dead son in Vietnam, Gaye's album with "Mother, mother, there's too many of you cryin'." Merle sings, "his hair's a little longer than we're used to" and Gaye snaps back, "Who are _they_ to judge us simply 'cause our hair is long?" Both albums, too, are to some degree frightened to the point of fatalism about where America stands in 1971. Marvin inquires despairingly, "Who is willing to try to save a world that's destined to die?" Merle warns that "like the mighty Roman Empire, this world is doomed to fall." Both suggest that Jesus is our best bet.

"Father, father, we don't need to escalate," Gaye pleads, and Merle's future father-in-law says amen: "I know the farmer's daughter loves the man."

In the fall of 1971, as the Sixties transformed themselves irretrievably into the Seventies, as his Muskogee Moment dribbled to an end, Merle followed _Hag_ with one more masterpiece. _Someday We'll Look Back_ is the album I'd nominate as Merle's greatest-ever and (no disrespect to _There's a Riot Goin' On_ or _Every Picture Tells a Story_ ) the best of that year. Its title track, a #2 hit, sees Merle promising better days to a lover or a wife . . . someday. A couple getting by in the meantime on "love and pennies" is a durable country subject, and Merle's sweet-tempered reading of his melody joins Norman Hamlet's soothing pedal steel in a model of patience and optimism even while settling in for the hard long haul and no promises. "If we both pull together . . . ," Haggard sings, pausing before adding "tomorrow will surely come." Hamlet fills the pause with a wink so that we won't miss Haggard's making a joke about the limits of human plans and agency, and a particularly grim joke at that. "When our dream world finds us, and these hard times are gone," Merle predicts, we'll look back at our fraught shared histories and tell ourselves a story about how these were the good old days.

The whole album is dark and bright like that, doomed and hopeful at once, all down the line. A quartet of songs—"Train of Life" by Roger Miller, "One Row at a Time" by Red Lane, "California Cottonfields" by Dallas Frazier, and the brooding, alternately childish and threatening "Carolyn," a #1 single from the Tommy Collins songbook—underscores Merle's gift at identifying songs by other people that sound like they just have to be ones he wrote himself. The ones he did write are remarkable. Each Haggard tune here is an imperative to sing along, each lyric a reason to keep silence and reflect. His "One Sweet Hello" couples with "one sad goodbye" to elevate a cliché into a worldview, and his "I'd Rather Be Gone" (as opposed to "in your way") is an elegant statement of that old escape route, it's-not-you-it's-me. "Tulare Dust" stands shoulder-to-Okie-shoulder with "Hungry Eyes" as the greatest contribution to his Kern County Suite. And "Huntsville," cut at the same 1969 session that produced "Irma Jackson" and featuring James Burton's coiled-to-strike Telecaster, is deep-down-in-the-dirt country funk. And definitively Merle. He's playing an outlaw being escorted to prison in leg irons—"I guess they got a good excuse"—and he's waiting patiently for his chance to break: "They're gonna lose old Hag." He swears he doesn't care if he gets killed in the attempt, and he makes even that suicide mission sound like freedom, instead of just an end to hurt.

The album's centerpiece is "Big Time Annie's Square," a Muskogee Moment fantasy in which small-town Merle visits a former girlfriend who's now living with a bunch of LSD-tripping hippies in "San Somethin' Somethin', close to east L.A." In Merle's dream, these previously warring camps all get along just swell—and without anyone having to change their minds or ways of living right to do it. Well, that's not quite true. Because if an "old Checotah boy" can imagine himself singing different strokes for different folks, and can even imagine himself enjoying it, then Merle Haggard had changed, just a little, and so had America.

**"It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad)," 1972**

The least romantic, most cynical love song ever to top the country chart isn't a love song at all so much as a song about settling. Nashville Cat Hargus "Pig" Robbins announces the record with a classic gospel piano run, lifting Merle's spirits with a sprightly right hand flourish before tumbling into depressed bass notes with his left. Merle repeats the cycle: His first line begins steadfast and grateful ("She was always there each time . . ."), then pulls the rug out from under itself (". . . I needed _you_ "). The record keeps lowering our expectations and shifting our attention downward. You can't always get what you want, this Hank Cochran and Glenn Martin–penned song argues, but sometimes, if you try, you can get . . . some.

"I don't have to wonder who she's had," Merle declares about the woman he's been seeing in lieu of the woman he wants. Not because he believes she's any more faithful than the one who's broken his heart, but because he doesn't really care what she does. In the chorus, each time he sings "I don't have to wonder . . . ," Merle's voice free-falls out of itself again and back into Lefty's. For just that instant, he sounds free from want, free from fear, even free from having to be Merle Haggard.

**He Wishes He Was Santa Claus**

"If We Make It through December," a #28 pop hit in 1973, was the biggest crossover hit of Haggard's career, even bigger than "Okie from Muskogee." It might also be the quintessential presentation of his hard-nosed Poet of the Common Man concerns. It's a Christmas song, but it feels almost like an anti-Christmas song. The character he plays isn't just feeling blue this holiday season like we've seen in hundreds of other Christmas numbers. He _hates_ Christmas, hates the whole idea of it, at least this year. "Got laid off down at the factory," he growls with a sigh. Now, he can't buy his wife and kids any presents—hell, he doesn't know how they'll make the new year even without gifts—and it's bringing him down like the plummeting temperature. Roy Nichols's acoustic guitar sounds pretty as falling flakes, but pings and stings like an ice storm. "If we make it through Decem-brrrr," Merle keeps repeating, trying to convince himself. _Then_ , we'll pack up and move on to someplace warm, maybe even to California.

After "If We Make It through December" turned out so well—it became Merle's sixteenth country #1 and was the title track to an LP released that spring—Ken Nelson suggested an entire Christmas album. Merle embraced the project wholeheartedly. On the front of 1974's _Merle Haggard's Christmas Present (Something Old, Something New)_ , he's posed in front of a roaring fire, Bonnie and kids at his side and sporting a cardigan straight out of a Bing Crosby special. On the back cover is a note from Santa, in which St. Nick explains that whether you asked for it or not, he's giving "you Merle Haggard's _first_ Christmas album." The "first' is italicized like that, too, as if recording a second in 1982, _Goin' Home for Christmas_ , and a third in 2004, _I Wish I Was Santa Claus_ , was on Merle's wish list all along.

Merle's commitment to Christmas music seems a little out of character, doesn't it? The emotions associated with holiday music have a kind of split personality to them: Earnest competes with zany, only one of which we think of as being especially Haggardian.

On the one hand the Christmas aesthetic favors the sorts of grown-up Christmas wishes that emerged on the radio during WWII, when Merle was a little boy and his father was still alive. Merle's big Christmas hit springs from common ground: " _If we make it through December_ [we've] got plans to be in a warmer town" finds an antecedent in the contingent cheer of "I'll be home for Christmas _if only in my dreams_ " and "Someday soon we all will be together _if the fates allow_." Christmas songs like these are arm's-length utopian. They yearn for peace, for families safely reunited amidst pretty Currier & Ives backdrops, but their key lines almost always begin with _if_ or strongly imply one. Bing is " _dreaming_ of a white Christmas," as is Merle on his three versions of the standard—his dreamiest being the one from a 1986 anthology called _Nashville's GreatestChristmas Hits_ that pairs Merle's croon with only Django Reinhardt–styled guitar.

At the same time, the Christmas aesthetic spikes its sobriety with healthy pours of full-on goofy wonder. The childlike ditties that dominated the pop charts just before the tweenage Merle began elbowing his way to adulthood—"Here Comes Santa Claus," "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer," and "Frosty the Snowman," all from Okie-turned-Cali-cowboy Gene Autry in 1948, '49, and '50, respectively—each evoke those week-of-the-25th moments when, as writer Mike Warren phrased it, "some spazzed-out kid hears bells . . . and freezes." That doesn't sound very Haggard.

Then again, doing the Christmas thing has long been a good way for Great American Artists to throw down on their American Greatness in the first place. Think: Bing, Elvis, and James Brown. Think Bob Dylan, whose 2009 _Christmas in the Heart_ prompted many to wonder, "What in the world is he thinking?" when a better question might have been "What took him so long?" The greatest artists all tend to get around to childlike wonder, playful silliness, rainbow dreams of the peace-on-earth variety at some point if for no other reason than that those qualities are all part of what it means to be _human_. The return engagements of Christmas music in the Haggard catalogue are enriching and functional in just that way. "As dancing," per Andre Dubus, "allows the tongue-tied man a ceremony of love," Christmas music allows Haggard to express emotions tamped down or absent in the rest of his work. His Christmas aesthetic allows the normally pessimistic Hag access to a variety of utopianism that's collective by definition, and it also gives the self-serious Haggard a chance to cut up and use silly voices and embrace his inner kid. It lets him have fun.

The Haggard Christmas catalogue includes ten tracks each from _Christmas Present_ and _Goin' Home_ , twelve more from _I Wish I Was Santa Claus_ , plus a "Blue Christmas" from his 1977 Elvis tribute and that 1986 "White Christmas." That comes to thirty-four tracks, but, thanks to repeats, just eighteen songs. Not unexpectedly, each Haggard Christmas album includes a fresh take on "If We Make It through December," and it's hardly surprising that this Crosby nut would tackle "White Christmas" three times. He's turned to "Blue Christmas" three times, as well, a natural choice for a big fan not only of Elvis but Ernest Tubb.

Most of the holiday duplication, though, comes down to rerecording his own songs. _Merle's Haggard's Christmas Present_ included a quintet of Haggard originals: "If We Make It . . . ," plus "Santa Claus and Popcorn," "Bobby Wants a Puppy Dog for Christmas," "Daddy Won't Be Home Again for Christmas" (he's on the road, but at least remembered to send a check), and "Grandma's Christmas Card" comprised the set's "Something New" first side. The "Something Old" Side Two was devoted to holiday standards done up in glittery, festive string arrangements courtesy of Billy Walker and His Orchestra. Merle reprised them all not quite a decade later on _Goin' Home for Christmas_ —not as strong as its predecessor, but it gets points for unabashed Christmas spirit: shimmering strings and glockenspiel, the Carpenters-sounding backing singers throughout, the dog arf-arf-arfing at the end of "Bobby Wants a Puppy . . . ," and most of all the wonderfully dorky toothless grampa voice he adopts for the title track.

You could look at all this, I suppose, and see nothing more than a time-tested seasonal marketing strategy, but I think that misses a big part of the point of Christmas albums generally and of Merle's holiday releases in particular. In all of pop music, commercial motivations are rarely mutually exclusive of emotional and aesthetic ones. Blatant seasonal marketing items may not be _only_ blatant seasonal marketing items—indeed, they are successful at parting people from their money each holiday season precisely because audiences find them useful, even enriching.

In the same commercial vein, recording and rerecording his own songs lets Merle work his publishing, but there's something perfectly Christmassy in the repetition, too. Christmas is a holiday that people celebrate traditionally, rehearsing the rituals that keep families connected to themselves and their own histories in a fatally dynamic world. "Grandma's Christmas Card" is about exactly this experience. With "O Little Town of Bethlehem" caroling in the background—the melody picked out simply by Roy Nichols on _Present_ , performed lushly by Walker and company on _Goin' Home_ —Merle recites in homage to a departed matriarch, ensuring hers is "the only card we keep from year to year."

Time changes everything: New ornaments replace damaged old ones; a real tree gives way to an artificial one; this year there's an empty chair at the table where Grandma always sat, but, just think, next December there'll be a newborn. Singing along to the same records, viewing the same animated TV specials, insisting upon the same sugar cookie recipe—celebrating the _same_ —honors forefathers and -mothers, eases transitions, connects each year's isolated chapter to an ongoing narrative bigger than oneself.

The All-American Christmas is a gesture, reminding that even though the world is a cold place, we have each other to keep us warm. Merle's Christmas music is a gesture, too, insisting that while life is fragile, fleeting, tragic, it sure is fun to have fun. And I'd add that, at least in Merle's case, it's a gesture that's overwhelmingly secular and Santa-centric. Of Merle's thirty-four Christmas tracks, only two are of the purely Baby Jesus sort—a 2004 go at Willie Nelson's "El Niño" that feels more menacing than grateful, and an almost more sprightly than somber "Silent Night" that has all of its sacred power undercut by the "Jingle Bells" that's _Christmas Present_ 's final word. Much more typical is the title track to _I Wish I Was Santa Claus_ : Merle figures Santa's got the game beat because he only has to work one day a year.

"Santa Claus and Popcorn," the Haggard original that appears on all three holiday sets, glorifies the newborn king, but juxtaposes the nativity every step of the way with temporal cheer. "Carolers singing 'Silent Night'" and "Jesus loves me, this I know" butt up against "Crosby dreams of Christmas white" and "Christmas trees and mistletoe." The song begins on its knees, slow and humble, like it's going to be a hymn. "We celebrate because a king was born . . . ," Merle croons, reverently, then floors it to sleigh-ride speed, explaining giddily that, sure, Christ is the reason for the season, but . . . "Snowballs! Crosby! Sleigh bells and reindeer horns!"

And maybe next year in California, if that job comes through, some presents under the tree.

**He Takes a Lot of Pride in What He Is**

(Hint: He's a White Boy)

In August of 1971, Merle appeared on an episode of _The 5th Dimension Travelling Sunshine Show_. In a skit, a member of the 5th Dimension delivers letters, one of which is intended for Merle Haggard. "Merle Haggard! Let _me_ deliver _that_ ," another member of the group, the love-struck Florence LaRue, swoons at the mention of the hunky star. Haggard then sings two numbers, "Someday We'll Look Back," his current single, and the proudly downscale "I've Done It All": He's hoboed, worn rummage-sale clothes, had holes in his shoes—and he's proud!

What? You were thinking Merle might take advantage of that setup—a beautiful black woman expressing romantic desire for a white man—to pull "Irma Jackson" out of mothballs? Well, no, but Merle and Capitol did belatedly introduce Ms. Jackson to the world a few months later on 1972's _Let Me Tell You about a Song_. "Irma Jackson" was a song he'd written and recorded some time ago, Merle explained deep on the album's second side, but hadn't released.

"Possibly because the time wasn't right. But I feel it's right now. And the song is purely fiction, created solely from my imagination. It's just a love story of two people of two different races and a situation that their families and society wouldn't accept." Then he makes that claim about "Irma" being perhaps his favorite composition. Years later, Merle told Deke Dickerson that no one ever requested "Irma" at shows, surmising that the lack of interest was because of his _Let Me Tell You . . ._ admission that the song "really wasn't anything that happened to me." Maybe, but I lean toward a simpler explanation: Fans tend not to request songs they've never heard.

Note, though, that Merle doesn't attribute the lack of requests to the song's subject matter. "The real problem with country's racial politics during the sixties was that they pretended not to exist," writes Craig Werner in _A Change Is Gonna Come: Music, Race & the Soul of America_. "Blacks weren't attacked, they simply weren't anywhere to be seen," a neglect that's largely persisted into the twenty-first century. The attention of Merle Haggard was a notable exception; he sang about race all through his Capitol years. Before "Irma," he'd cut "Go Home," a Tommy Collins song about a white man's friends forcing his Mexican bride to go back where she came from, and in 1976, the Cindy Walker–penned "Cherokee Maiden," where Merle pines for a Native American woman he calls his "sweet little chickadee," became his last #1 of the decade. In between those came "Brown-Skinned Gal" on the Wills tribute, and in '74 his own "The Seashores of Old Mexico," in which a "young senorita" falls for Merle's "lingo" (rhymes with "gringo"). It wasn't all interracial romance, either. "Uncle Lem," for example, a Glenn Martin song Merle cut in 1973, features a man whose "mom was bought and sold" and had himself been "born a slave." At song's end, this "uncle" shames white elites with his forgiveness and generosity.

Merle also wrote and recorded two songs in these years in which he goes out of his way to play the whiteness card. In 1974's "White Man Singing the Blues," Merle feels validated to learn that a black man appreciates his music: "Old Joe said I was a soul brother from the things I'd been singing about." And in "I'm a White Boy," from 1977, he compiles a checklist of what makes him white in the first place. His father wasn't named "Willie Woodrow," for one thing; he "wasn't born and raised in no ghetto" either. "I ain't black and I ain't yellow," he attests. Then, in case you'd missed it, he shouts it loud: "I'm proud! And white! And I got a song to sing!"

He means he's got a song to sing _too_. "I'm a White Boy" was like an aggrieved-feeling white reply to James Brown's "Say It Loud—I'm Black and I'm Proud." Come to think of it, so was "Okie from Muskogee." "Okie," that Dust Bowl–days insult, was nothing after all but a time- and region-specific synonym for "white trash." Merle was proud of it.

Historian Peter La Chapelle notes a Depression-era sign in the lobby of at least one Bakersfield movie house: "Negroes and Okies Upstairs." A telling equation, and one that would have struck those southwestern newcomers hard. Back home, whiteness had been nearly all Okies had going for them. You may have been living bottom of the barrel, cropping on the shares in a tumble-down shack, with your kids hungry, the store saying no credit, and Christmas coming. But at least you knew, as Lillian Smith summed up the South's Jim Crow politics, you're "a sight better than the black man." There was potential cross-racial unity in shared poverty—as Merle sings in "White Man Singing the Blues," he and Old Joe were from "the same side of the railroad track where people have nothing to lose"—except, of course, that "the same side" didn't mean "the same." Poor whites did have at least _one_ thing to lose.

The Okies had a great deal to lose by the Sixties and Seventies. They'd worked hard, been assimilated— _become_ white, like the Irish and Italians before them—only to find their economic status in jeopardy. Haggard's white blue-collar audience in the Seventies faced material threats, via stagnant wages, inflation, and rising unemployment: "If We Make It through December" reflected the times, and a mood. The group felt political threats, too, resulting from newly empowered minorities whose gains were perceived by too many white working folk simply as loss of power for themselves. And there were psychological wounds, inflicted by a middle-class culture that still looked down upon white working folk, southerners and onetime southerners in particular, as racist and sexist and stupid by definition, no matter their advances and hard work. Trash was supposed to be Other People. But . . . _everybody'd been treating us like trash_.

Trash, white trash, poor white trash . . . these slurs need unpacking. Nowadays, "trash" is understood mostly in economic and aesthetic terms. It's shorthand for tacky, cheaply made consumer goods and for the trashy people who lack the ambition, work ethic, and minimum intelligence to resist them. That might apply to anyone, but "poor _white_ trash" makes a racial accusation. Self-identified "native" Californians saw Okies like the Haggards as dirty, dumb, and dangerous breeders living so low-down they'd betrayed their race: They might as well have been black and, therefore, deserved to be thrown away.

That line in "Workin' Man Blues" where Merle boasts he's never been on welfare was a not-so-coded attack on poor black Americans who did receive public assistance and, in stereotype, preferred it to getting a job. But Haggard's pride in keeping his nose in close proximity to the grindstone was also self-defense. White people, real white people, the song suggests, work whether they would prefer to or not, and they do so without the privileged middle-class expectation that it will provide personal fulfillment in excess of cash payment. Merle in _Look_ , 1968: "If you like your job, you're not doing it right."

Or, as Merle attests in "I'm a White Boy": "If you want to get ahead ya gotta hump and git it!" A few lines later, he slathers his voice with over-the-top twang and brays:

_I'm a blue-eyed 'billy, kinda frail and ruddy_ ,

_So I'll have to work to be somebody . . ._

_I don't want no handout livin' . . ._

_I'm proud! And white!_

That Bicentennial Merle single, "Here Comes the Freedom Train," rode freedom to a final verse that acknowledged "two brothers known as Kennedy—and Martin Luther King." That detail was proof attitudes were changing fast, if not fast enough. But Merle's singles typically didn't do race at all, and after his Muskogee Moment, they didn't usually do politics explicitly either—and they didn't go pop. With the significant exception of "If We Make It through December," Haggard never had a crossover hit once James Burton signed on with Elvis. He occasionally appeared on television—his title song for the Claude Akins–starring trucker series _Movin' On_ was a top country hit in '75; he played a singer, and recovering alcoholic, on a 1976 episode of _The Waltons_ —but that part of his career was mostly over, as well. He was just a country star again, though of a rare sort: To many, Merle Haggard now _stood_ for country music, a symbolic function he served even for people who didn't like the genre—thanks to "Okie" and "Fightin' Side," especially for those people. When _Time_ , late to the party, did a 1974 story called "Country Music: Songs of Love, Loyalty & Doubt," it was thirty-seven-year-old Merle Haggard who was on the cover.

The hits kept coming. Between the time "Carolyn" topped the country charts in 1972 and the release of his final Capitol singles, "A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today," "The Running Kind," and "The Way It Was in '51," in 1977 and '78, Haggard racked up a baker's dozen more #1's to go with the ten he already had, and there were relatively less popular singles as well. Some of these we've already looked at—"It's Not Love (But It's Not Bad)," "The Roots of His Raising," the randy "Old Man from the Mountain." And there was "I Wonder If They Ever Think of Me," a topical 1973 prison ballad about a POW, and 1975's "Always Wanting You," an aching love song that kept its inspiration a secret (Merle had been pursuing Dolly Parton romantically for a couple of years, but she'd rebuffed his advances), but throbbed with unmistakable loss.

Haggard kept releasing solid albums through the Seventies, too. Some of these, such as 1971's reverent double album gospel set _Land of Many Churches_ , remain gems of the country canon. More often his albums were less focused during these years than they'd been—1974's _Merle Haggard Presents His 30th Album_ , its title inflected with exhaustion, was emblematic—and his songwriting, and song selection, were less consistent, too, though the next great album track was never far away. Haggard's take on Hank Williams's "Moanin' the Blues," from 1977's _A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today_ album, professed misery while enacting freedom's headlong rush like nothing he'd ever recorded. He was at his cynical best on "Love and Honor" (he's betting it never crossed her mind), from _If We Make It through December_ , and "Turning Off a Memory," from _Let Me Tell You about a Song_ , was a memorable late-Capitol-era drinker. It was covered three years later by British folk-rock duo Richard and Linda Thompson, and the rock and country covers of Haggard tunes kept on like that as well. Lynyrd Skynyrd roared through "Honky Tonk Night Time Man" in 1977, and "Life's Like Poetry" became Lefty Frizzell's next-to-last charting single in '75.

Frizzell died only a few months later. Merle's in memoriam, the lovely "Goodbye Lefty," is one of those old-school tribute songs composed more or less entirely of the honoree's most famous song titles. "I'd love to hear a jukebox play . . . ," Merle begins with head bowed. Then he counts off Lefty's greatest hits, all while recycling and recombining Lefty's melodies, licks, and phrasing, love-struck still.

My favorite Merle Haggard album in his final years at Capitol was 1974's _I Love Dixie Blues . . . So I Recorded Live in New Orleans_. Like prior concert releases, the album climaxed with "Okie from Muskogee," the fourth time he'd released it in five years. Merle and his fans seized every opportunity to shout their pride to the world, or at least to themselves.

But "pride" is a tenuous state in Haggard's music. He's worried it in his songs repeatedly through the years. "You always find a way to hurt my pride" and "I'd like to . . . be proud of who I am" and "I got to keep my reputation, I got to keep my pride," and pushing twenty more appearances of the word in his lyrics join many more references to one shameful scar or another, to pride's absence. This is a lot of going on about pride, and just as we can say that a person who makes a fetish of roots is a person who feels uprooted, and the fella who makes a big point of letting everyone know he doesn't give a shit what people think is a fella who gives a pretty big shit, we can add this rule of thumb: The man who won't stop talking about how he's proud to be this, takes a lot of pride in that, is either a man deeply ashamed of something or a man convinced that a lot of others believe he has nothing at all to be proud of. This doesn't mean he's lying to himself. But it's a precarious pride, perpetually identifying attacks upon itself, some of which are real, and it's often a pride based less upon what one's done than in what one couldn't help but be. "I'm proud and white," Merle keeps declaring in "I'm a White Boy." He's proud to be an Okie, too, and for forty years now, his audience boisterously sings along because, even in our enlightened twenty-first century, the white southern working class is still routinely looked down upon within ostensibly polite, middle-class society. Especially there.

America's legacy of race and class loomed over every note of Haggard's _I Love Dixie Blues . . . So I Recorded Live in New Orleans_ , though essential details of that history go mostly unspoken—frustratingly so, as Merle was uncharacteristically loquacious at the concert. Before singing a note, he explains the show will be dedicated to "the music that originated in New Orleans over a half a century earlier," that he's especially interested in the origins of American music, and "who knows, maybe it got started in the cotton fields of the south." Here he means the blues, of course. But because he's augmented the Strangers this evening with the Dixieland Express, a small white horn trio, it's clear he also intends "Dixie Blues" to take in jazz, as well—specifically, hot jazz, the syncopated, improvisational style that emerged from black New Orleans in the Twenties, but that by the Seventies was better known by the nostalgic name of Dixieland.

Haggard means by "Dixie Blues" at least one more thing, too. When Merle sings "Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now)" and "I Ain't Got Nobody (and Nobody Cares for Me)," he introduces them as having been recorded "by a fella by the name of Emmett Miller." Not many people remember him, he admits. But when he explains that Miller inspired Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, and Bob Wills (who'd introduced Merle to Miller's music a few years prior), the crowd cheers. What he doesn't explain is that Miller performed in blackface, a sin of omission on Merle's part that's a cousin once-removed of country music's neglect of race generally.

"What's better than blues?" he asks, then plays a lilting one of his own. Haggard's live "Everybody's Had the Blues," a country chart-topper in late summer 1973, pinpoints precisely that early-twentieth-century intersection between jazz and big-city pop ("Love and hate, want and wait, till misery fills your mind," he sings in the Tin Pan Alley–ish bridge) and what Merle later refers to as "the Negro blues," and go ahead and toss country in there, too. To put it another way, "Everybody's Had the Blues" is a song you could easily imagine Emmett Miller singing the hell out of because it fits so neatly into the tradition that preceded, and to varying degrees shaped, all those other American styles: minstrelsy. Our original popular music, minstrelsy began in the early nineteenth century when white people began to mimic, inaccurately and stereotypically and with faces covered in burnt cork, the dance and music of black people. Appreciative audiences—mostly working-class whites who competed against free blacks in the urban labor markets of the north—used these mocking performances to reinforce their sense of relative superiority. Yet even while dehumanizing blacks, minstrelsy performed humanizing labor, as well, presenting "darkies" who got the blues (just like white people!) and who had a culture of improvisational resilience that Americans of all colors and classes have been using ever since. If Merle was looking for the origins of American music, then Miller isn't a half-bad place to begin the search—and I enter it as another credit to the Haggard legacy that he did. If only he'd pursued matters much further.

Maybe that was the plan. _I Love Dixie Blues_ was actually two albums, though only one of them was ever released. Merle had finished a new themed studio album called _I Love Dixie Blues_ —test pressings were done, the cover art was set—when he called an audible and decided to rerecord some of that material live in New Orleans. Most of the abruptly shelved studio sides—a hot, bawdy "Stingeree"; Merle's own "Hag's Dixie Blues #2"; a number he titled "Combine Blues" because, presumably, it combined verses from W. C. Handy's "St. Louis Blues" with ones from Jimmie Rodgers's fourth blue yodel; and a few other tunes—would be dribbled out one and two at a time over the next few years on Haggard's remaining Capitol albums. Three of those studio sides, though—the pair of songs he introduced as Miller's and a version of "Lovesick Blues" he tells the crowd he learned from Hank Williams before copying Miller's version right down to the horns—wound up being replaced entirely by the live New Orleans versions.

It was another opportunity missed. If Merle had followed through with the studio version of _I Love Dixie Blues_ , it would've been among his best albums ever, and perhaps even his most important. Still, the album he did release, _I Love Dixie Blues. . . . So I Recorded Live in New Orleans_ , is a thrilling document, loose and lively in a way Haggard had rarely been even at his finest. The addition of the Dixieland Express gives the songs drive and character without sounding quaint; the Strangers swing hard and free; and Merle, singing relaxed, is having a blast. Even the album's inevitable version of "Okie from Muskogee" has a bounding, playful quality his earlier versions lacked. "Everybody sing one time," Merle coaxes his audience, and everybody does: _I'm proud to be an Okie . . ._ A producer, that is, not a moocher. A maker, not a taker. White.

**"A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere Today," 1977**

This is Merle "Workin' Man" Haggard at his staying-put-and-working-his-ass-off best. In fact, the song posits Merle's ass as a kind of barometer of what all his labor has profited him, which, by his own estimation, ain't much. In the first verse, Merle gripes that "for years I've been bustin' my rear" to no account, save a growing pile of bills and an aching back, then elaborates on the theme in the chorus: "Today I'll work my fanny off—and leave it lay."

That's a joke, son, though how funny you find it probably comes down to how much your own ass aches when you stare at your own stack of duns. If you feel like you're being pulled in a hundred directions and all of them down, if the only retirement community you can imagine for yourself is a cemetery, then this joke's for you. And it's nice to know a big star like Merle tries to do the right thing, just like you, and the right thing pays lousy for him too. Merle sounds like a guy you could commiserate with over a couple of pitchers, especially when he shakes his head and bitches:

_I pay my income tax—and the government gives back_

_What I got comin', but it ain't much_

_I pay my child support—'cause I'm a law-abidin' sort_

_And an easy touch_

The album art makes the connection between artist and audience explicit. Merle's dressed in denim work clothes and schlepping a lunch pail with a hard hat cocked wearily on his head. He's playing a representative laborer and, as he's also waiting at a bus stop, he appears representatively hard put. It's a nice gesture on Merle's part, a touch of Carter-era, energy-crisis empathy to picture himself at a bus stop when so many more of his fans than usual were doing the same. As always, though, this identification runs both ways for Merle. His entire life, then as now, is built around catching the bus to work and pulling another shift on stage. No wonder that in the last chorus of "A Working Man Can't Get Nowhere . . . ," this working-class hero makes sure that " _Today_ I'll work my fanny off" becomes " _Tonight_ . . ." He's not just singing the "Workin' Man Blues" (that earlier record's hammer clocks in here, too). He's got a chronic case.

**His Country Girl with Hot Pants On**

Merle Haggard and Leona Williams were married in October 1978, and "The Bull and Beaver," a song Williams wrote to perform with Haggard, made the country chart before it was even Halloween. That doesn't mean the top ten hit was like a musical wedding announcement—outtakes from the honeymoon's more like it. Ostensibly about two truckers arranging a hookup via citizen's band, its double entendres fly by like highline poles: Her sleeper cab has a mirrored ceiling (perfect for the record's discotheque beat), and she goes by the name of "the Beaver," CB lingo for a, um, lady. His handle is "the Bull." Get it?

"The Bull and the Beaver" is by a wide margin the biggest hit Leona Williams ever had, which is really too bad. Throughout a career that was already fifteen-years-long before she met Merle, Williams proved an evocative singer as well as a successful songwriter and musician, an important overlooked figure from when country radio began its slow transition from a male-to female-dominated format.

Leona Helton was born in the northern Ozarks town of Vienna, Missouri, in 1943. The Heltons were a large musical family—Leona Belle was number nine of a dozen kids—but she distinguished herself as particularly talented and ambitious. At fifteen, she convinced a radio station to give her a show if she signed up the necessary sponsors. Which she did, earning a weekly program, _Leona Sings_.

In 1959, she married and moved to St. Louis, studied for her beautician's license, and, a year later, had a son, but was pushing toward music all the while, working as one-half of a rhythm section for hire—her husband drummed; Leona slapped doghouse bass—for local acts and national up- and- comers passing through town. One of the latter was Loretta Lynn, who in 1966 tagged Leona to play bass in her first backing band, the Blue Kentuckians. "I used to have Leona Williams playing bass in my band and singing harmony," Lynn observes in her 1976 autobiography, _Coal Miner's Daughter_. "She's one of the best musicians in Nashville."

The Lynn gig didn't last even a year but led to things. For starters, Lynn included one of Leona's songs, "Get Watcha Got and Go," on her chart-topping 1967 LP, _Don't Come Home A Drinkin' (with Lovin' on Your Mind)_. That exposure helped Leona get an Opry appearance, and she signed with Hickory Records in 1968. Results there were disappointing, a trio of basement-level chart entries dribbled over the next half decade. Williams's time at the label did produce, however, her indelible "Country Girl with Hot Pants On," a rousing what's-good-for-the-gander bit of not-quite-feminist rebellion. In addition to being a hip-cocking showcase for Williams's husky alto, "Hot Pants" documents sexy blue-collar femininity, circa 1971. From now on, Leona announces to her skirt-chasing better half, she's wearing embroidered short shorts—with tinted hose!—whether he likes it or not. Egged on by electric licks that whip about like a bunch of rubbernecking good old boys, she sounds confident he'll like it fine.

Early in 1974, Bonnie Owens requested a hiatus from the road (she was replaced, briefly, by Louise Mandrell). Merle met a not-long-divorced Leona that September. He'd heard her on the radio, had liked her voice, and filed away her name. Their mutual friend, Stranger guitarist Ronnie Reno, did the introductions while Haggard was recording in Nashville. Leona wound up, during a September session, providing backing vocals to "Where Have All the Hobos Gone," later included on Haggard's _My Love Affair with Trains_. Merle was impressed with Williams from the start, smitten romantically ("I knew this wasn't just another 'girl singer' I could con into toeing the mark and warming the sheets" is how he describes his initial assessment of the situation in _Sing Me Back Home_ ) and musically. "She had more talent . . . than any ten women I'd met," he writes. Quite a claim from a man only then surfacing from deep immersion in the hypertalented charms of Dolly Parton.

Merle asked Leona to join him on the road as the show's harmony singer and featured vocalist. We can hear Leona to good effect in the latter role on her 1976 MCA album, _San Quentin's First Lady_. Cut live during a New Year's Day appearance at the prison, Leona runs through a ten-song opening set backed by the Strangers and highlighted by Haggard songs, including a brassy reading of "Workin' _Girl_ Blues." Her finale is "San Quentin," a number Merle wrote for the occasion. When she declares, "San Quentin prison, I learn to hate you more each visitin' day," her captive audience nearly whoops down the walls.

In the years running up to their marriage, Leona became a fixture of the Merle Haggard Show, while also experiencing a certain amount of hostility from Merle's audiences. They preferred Bonnie and viewed her, she felt, as a home wrecker. Never mind that Bonnie's and Merle's marriage was long over and that Bonnie famously stood as maid of honor at the Haggard-Williams nuptials. (Rose Maddox sang "You Light Up My Life.")

Williams also became during this time one of Merle's favorite cowriters. Except "After Loving You," however (a three-way cowrite with Reno from 1976's _It's All in the Movies_ ), none of their collaborations made it to vinyl until Merle moved on to MCA Records in early '77. Merle recorded a handful of Williams's solo compositions, too, notably a pair of chart-toppers from early in Merle's subsequent decade-long tenure at Epic: 1982's tellingly titled "You Take Me for Granted" and, from the following year and the very end of their time together, "Someday When Things Are Good." As in, "Someday when things are good, I'm gonna leave you." Leona auditioned the song for Merle not long after filing for divorce.

Unwilling to forgo her ambitions in favor of her husband's as Bonnie had, Leona continued to pursue a solo career. Merle seems alternately to have supported and undermined her efforts. For instance, he encouraged her to get her own band and hit the road, but refused to perform with her in support of "The Bull and the Beaver," touring with Bonnie instead. In 1982, Merle got permission from Epic to team with Leona on a duet album for her label, Mercury. This was a move guaranteed to increase Leona's exposure but that had the additional effect of interrupting work on the solo LP she was just then in the process of completing. Mercury's excitement about landing a Haggard record contributed at first to Leona's album being delayed, then shelved altogether.

By the time _Heart to Heart_ was released in summer 1983, Merle and Leona had been divorced for weeks, finishing their whirlwind decade of musical and romantic partnership. But, as the cliché goes, they sure did make beautiful music together while they lasted, and _Heart to Heart_ tops the list. Though ostensibly a "duet" album, _Heart to Heart_ sounds like a Merle Haggard record through and through, highlighting Merle and the band and, at times, downplaying his duet partner's contributions. Indeed, on some tracks, Williams is allowed barely a supporting role—on the rollicking version of the Maddox Brothers & Rose–associated "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down," Leona sings exactly one line of lead vocal while her fellow Strangers Roy, Don (on pennywhistle!), Norm, and Tiny are not only awarded significant solos, but shout outs. The country-pop standard "I'll Never Be Free" was originally a duet smash for Kay Starr and Tennessee Ernie Ford, but here is an exquisitely bluesy Merle Haggard special. Leona provides only way-in-the-back backup.

Given a chance, though, Leona more than holds her own on the title track and on "Don't Ever Let Your Love Sleep Alone," as well as on "Let's Pretend We're Not Married Tonight" and "Waltz across Texas," all worthy contributions to the country duet tradition. And on "It's Cold in California," a Freddy Powers song about former lovers who can't shake their exes even as they make their way back to separate worlds, Leona may actually upstage her ex, line for line and tear for gulped tear, recrimination for recrimination.

The single off _Heart to Heart_ was the doubly appropriate "We're Strangers Again," a pained, but blameless, farewell and the couple's final cowrite. It stiffed at radio, but I recommend it.

**He's Always on a Mountain When He Falls**

By the latter half of the 1970s, Merle Haggard had come a very long way from Oildale and San Quentin. He'd placed forty-three singles on _Billboard_ 's country charts, twenty-four of them #1's, and in 1970 had won the industry's top prize, the Country Music Association's "Entertainer of the Year." Even better, in 1972, he received a pardon from California governor Ronald Reagan: "Therefore, in view of indications . . . that the applicant is now a fully rehabilitated member of society . . ." Only a year later, he performed for President Nixon, and he appeared on the cover of _Time_ a year after that. The Hag hadn't just made it. He'd made it to the top.

He ran. As the Seventies wound to an end, Haggard was more restless even than usual. After a long decade with Capitol, he signed with MCA in 1976. That meant he'd no longer be working with Ken Nelson and would be recording in Nashville for the first extended period in his career, most often with producer Jimmy Bowen. He even moved to Nashville for a while, and in 1978, he divorced Bonnie Owens and wed Leona Williams. Then, in 1979, he announced he was quitting music entirely. "Male menopause," he later called it.

Merle's first single for MCA, a #2 country hit in early 1977, was a country-soul number written by Sonny Throckmorton, "If We're Not Back in Love by Monday" (soon enough a big hit for R&B singer Millie Jackson). That same year, Merle's second MCA single, also a #2 hit, was a modern-sounding bit of Music Row southern rock called "Ramblin' Fever." First line: "My hat don't hang on the same nail too long." "I wrote it at Leona Williams' house in the Seventies there one afternoon," he remembers in the 1987 concert video _Poet of the Common Man_. "I don't recall what in the hell caused me to write it."

"Ramblin' Fever" seemed to promise plenty of strong new songs to come. Both the quantity and quality of original Haggard material had slowed considerably over his last Capitol releases, leading some to guess he was saving the good stuff for MCA. But there doesn't appear to have been much good stuff coming from Merle at this time, or much new stuff at all. On his first MCA album, 1977's _Ramblin' Fever_ , he had a hand in writing just two of ten tracks, a rate that only doubled the following year for his third MCA LP, _I'm Always on a Mountain When I Fall_. Of course, quantity isn't everything, but with the exception of that album's "It's Been a Great Afternoon," a beguiling hangover treatment and another #2 hit, it's not as if any of Haggard's new songs came within shouting distance of his best. Then again, writing your own songs isn't everything either. The country-pop title track to that album, written by Chuck Howard, found Merle bemoaning the way insult was always being added to his injuries. He's well used to losing, Merle sings, but why do the hardest falls always come "just when I thought I'd finally made it"? "I'm Always on a Mountain When I Fall" was another #2. Merle had five of those at MCA, and another five top tens, but during his first four years on the label, his only #1, the twenty-fifth of his career, came when he teamed with Clint Eastwood in 1980 to sing "Bar Room Buddies," for the _Bronco Billy_ soundtrack on Elektra.

Sandwiched tightly between _Ramblin' Fever_ and _I'm Always on a Mountain . . ._ was another Haggard tribute album, this one dedicated to Elvis Presley, a project already underway when Presley died in August 1977. Merle quickly penned "From Graceland to the Promised Land," launched it dramatically with a bit of "Also Sprach Zarathustra," and _My Farewell to Elvis_ was out by October. It was a disappointing effort to say the least, not because it was particularly bad, but just because its arrangements were so generic in a faux-Fifties sort of way: The players included old Presley sidemen the Jordanaires and drummer Buddy Harman, but not, frustratingly, the King's contemporary collaborator and Haggard friend James Burton. The album felt like a missed opportunity, the obvious parallels between the Haggard and Presley catalogues never taken advantage of. "Jailhouse Rock" was another prison number but with comic relief. "In the Ghetto" was kin to Merle's "Mama Tried," but without the comparatively happy ending of a life sentence. Those are interesting connections, potentially, but unfortunately it's me making them, not _Farewell to Elvis_.

After three dispiriting efforts in a row, Merle's fourth MCA album, 1979's _Serving 190 Proof_ , was a revelation. An unprecedented intersection in the Haggard catalogue of introspective songwriting and musical experimentation, _Serving 190 Proof_ can still startle all these years later with its forthright examinations of alcoholism and depression, and its jaded takes on the musician's life.

It doesn't even sound like a Merle Haggard record. The brooding opener, "Footlights," is kicked off by an electric piano quote of Bill Withers's "Lean on Me," but Haggard was by no means offering listeners a helping hand. "I live the kind of life most men only dream of," the country superstar begins, acknowledging his privilege. But he's over forty now and feeling suffocated by it all. He's sick of having to put on his "old inst-omatic grin" and play the bad-ass every night, weary of having "to kick the footlights out again" even when that's the last thing he feels like. The idea for the song came to him, Merle's said, when, just as he was preparing to take the stage one evening, he was informed that Lefty Frizzell had died. The music bristles with energy, but feels like it's dragging him down, too, holding him back, and Merle's craggy baritone is a long, weary sigh of duty and resentment: "Tonight I'll kick the footlights out and walk away without a curtain call."

Many hardcore Haggard fans will go to bat for _190 Proof_ as his best, and they might be right. The album also gets cited as Merle's most personal, and there's no doubt that's true. Lines like "I'm 41 today, still going on 22," from "Red Bandana," or "I'll hide my age and make the stage," from "Footlights," are among the reasons why Haggard is so widely perceived not merely to write from, but about, his personal experiences, and from here on out Merle would write far more often from explicitly autobiographical points of view. Though lest we think that clarifies matters, consider that when "old Hag," as the song says, visits a "psychoed-out psychologist" in "Heaven Was a Drink of Wine," he's doing it in a song written by Sanger Shafer.

All through the album Haggard feels like he's just barely hanging on to his right mind. He's not just alone; he's lonely—and insistent that nothing can change on that score if he wants to stay free. To the hypnotically eddying melody of "Driftwood," he tells a lover goodbye: "Like the colors of the rainbow we blended well together," he tells her, "for a while." Over a jazz-funk rhythm track you'd swear was yanked from Steely Dan's _Aja_ , he confesses that he's going to keep trying to run from life even though he knows deep down "I Can't Get Away." And "My Own Kind of Hat" is a remarkable assertion of individualism, though notably it proclaims that individualism (not to be confused with individuality) in the same proud and not-a-little-adversarial terms used by millions of people threatened by diversity. There are two kinds of mothers, two kinds of cherries and of fairies, and so on, Merle sneers over brittle fiddle. Or so he's been told, he adds with mock innocence.

The album closer, "Roses in Winter," has a melody that evokes the darkness of "Shelly's Winter Love" and the brightness of "The Day the Rains Came," and Merle's lyrics find the wisdom to split the difference. "We'll have roses in winter," he croons with great patience and greater need. "We'll have good times with the bad." That may not be the kind of life most men dream of, but for sure it's the most any of us are going to get.

Merle reprised "From Graceland to the Promised Land," a top five hit, for _Nashville Remembers Elvis on His Birthday_ , a nationally televised special in January 1980, but as had long been his way, Haggard paid respects to less-heralded ancestors and relatives all through his MCA years. In 1979, for example, Merle and the Strangers had done some recording with that old country Crosby, Ernest Tubb. Those sessions never saw the light of day, but he did join Tubb, Charlie Daniels, and others for a version of "Walking the Floor over You" that became a minor hit that fall. And in the spring, he included a trio of the old Troubadour's songs—"Take Me Back and Try Me One More Time," "I'll Be Glad to Take You Back," and "It's Been So Long Darlin'"—on _The Way I Am_ , Haggard's fifth MCA LP in just three years. That album also featured two more covers in honor of men who'd made him the way he was: a relaxed but still fiercely swinging rendition of Stuart Hamblen's "(Remember Me) I'm the One Who Loves You" and a version of Floyd Tillman's classic statement of romantic fatalism, "It Makes No Difference Now." Merle makes his voice sound so beaten down on that one, it's a tiny miracle he can even summon the strength to shrug his shoulders in resignation.

Merle's songwriting ran hot and cold during his MCA tenure, but his vocals were always nuanced and hauntingly melodic, gorgeous enough even to save mediocre material (though not even Merle could salvage his silly "Sky-Bo," "a new kind of hobo for planes!"). And when the songs were great, as with another #2 hit, the whatta-ya-gonna-do-but-yearn "The Way I Am," written by Sonny Throckmorton, Merle's recordings were as good as they'd ever been. "The way I am don't fit my shackles," he sings, his voice flying powerfully to stretch out that "am," then collapsing into a moaning heap each time he feels his "shackles."

That Throckmorton line makes a pretty good thesis statement for Haggard's career. "Wish I enjoyed what makes my living, did what I do with a willing hand," from the same song, is pretty good, too. And apparently pretty true to its singer's life, for it was after _The Way I Am_ that Merle said to hell with it: to hell with having to make a new album every other season, to hell with meet and greets and autographs and working your publishing; to hell most of all with the Sisyphean toil of what he described to writer Alanna Nash as "a twenty-year bus ride." He moved back to California, got himself a houseboat on Lake Shasta, and told people he was done. He may have even meant it, or maybe he just wanted to do some woodshedding. What we can say for sure is that when he returned to Nashville six months later, Merle Haggard had written himself a stack of swell new Merle Haggard songs.

His next album, _Back to the Barrooms_ , included the top ten "Leonard," dedicated to friend and mentor Tommy Collins, and "Our Paths May Never Cross," which besides establishing the sonic template for a couple of dozen George Strait hits to come, found Haggard both hopelessly romantic (there's someone out there he's meant to be with, he just knows there is) and hopelessly fatalistic (not that he'll ever find her). But as its title suggested, the album was built around Merle's strongest batch of drinking songs since he'd made his name with the genre back in the Sixties. First up was "Misery and Gin," a Snuff Garrett composition that had originally appeared on the _Bronco Billy_ soundtrack alongside his Eastwood duet and that cultivated a Tin Pan Alley classicism that suited Haggard's mature voice and phrasing. The rest of the record is honky-tonk classicism at its finest: Merle wails "Back to the Barrooms Again"—"my shaky legs trying to stand"—as if he'd known all along that the taverns were where he'd end up. He announces to whoever's buying that "I Don't Want to Sober Up Tonight" and, to that end, "I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink," which became his only MCA single to reach #1.

His woman, he bitches on that album closer, doesn't care what he thinks. So: " _I_ think I'll just stay here and drink." Drink and, apparently, listen to the band, as this single is as close as Merle had come to capturing in the studio the energy and abandon of his live show. For nearly four minutes, an eternity on country radio, Merle sings a few lines then steps aside so Larry Muhobarec can pound the keys, so Don Markham can wail on sax, so guitarist Reggie Young can play the blues. "We're gone," Merle says at the fade, and for the most part that was true to life too. Within a couple of months, he'd moved on again, signing with Epic Records, though not before quickly delivering two albums he still owed to MCA.

Nineteen eighty-one's live _Rainbow Stew_ found Merle on home soil, running through a set of mostly recent hits at Anaheim Stadium and showing off his band to better effect than his three Capitol concert sets combined. The Strangers were as fierce as any band going in these years, and on _Rainbow Stew_ steel player Norman Hamlet, horn man Don Markham, and pianist Mark Yeary all get room to stretch out and improvise. Here and there Merle joins in himself on jagged electric guitar, though it's Roy Nichols who keeps stealing the show with sprightly, jazzy solos. In the studio, those recent drinking numbers had broken a sweat trying to maintain control, but live they didn't even try to keep their cool, especially on fiddle breakdowns that run hot, then burst into flame. The show ends with "Sing Me Back Home," which after all the rocking and racing around that's come before seems to move at a crawl. A funereal crawl, I'm tempted to say, except that the slowed pacing gives the prisoners in Haggard's old song room to breathe free. As Hamlet's pedal steel flies away, the doomed men fly too, and at last "Sing Me Back Home" is revealed as the anthem it was all along.

Recorded in April 1981, _Songs for the Mama That Tried_ was a gospel set dedicated to the seventy-nine-years-young Flossie Haggard. Stripped down to mostly acoustic arrangements, produced by Merle alone, graced by Merle's reverent, soulful singing and the harmonies of both Bonnie Owens and Leona Williams, the album is filled with old country gospel favorites ("Softly and Tenderly," "Keep on the Sunny Side") and new ones (Kris Kristofferson's "Why Me" and "One Day at a Time"). _The Mama That Tried_ included no hit singles and nobody bought it. It included no grand Haggardian thesis statements, and nobody today calls it his best album. It will just have to settle for being perfect.

**"Rainbow Stew," 1981**

In 1929, when Jim and Flossie Haggard moved west the first time, a popular song among the Okies was "Big Rock Candy Mountain." In that Harry McClintock number, a hobo encourages us to ride alongside him to a utopia. He's headed "where you sleep out every night," "the handouts grow on bushes," and "the boxcars all are empty," where there are lemonade streams and cigarette trees and "they hung the jerk that invented work." If this land exists anywhere, it's only somewhere over the rainbow, but at the time it reminded a lot of folks of California.

Fifty years on, Merle Haggard, that lifelong Californian, is having none of it. He'd told us a decade earlier that "Every Fool Has a Rainbow"—even him, placing empathetic emphasis on _fool_. Now, on the title track to his MCA live album, a #4 country hit, he says to hell with empathy and mocks outright what he considers over-the-rainbow dreams, sardonic emphasis on _rainbow_. Merle even recycles bits and pieces of McClintock's tune. Compare, for example, the melody of Hag's "eatin' rainbow stew with a silver spoon" to McClintock's "there's a lake of stew and of whiskey too."

With Norman Hamlet's steel guitar snickering away, Haggard advises that we "don't need to get high to get happy," which should've been clue enough he's pulling our leg as he lays out a series of presumably fever-dream scenarios. When we learn how to burn water for fuel and use the sun to heat our homes, when a president actually does what he promises and "people start doing what they oughta be doin'," why, then "We'll all be drinkin' that free Bubble Up and eatin' that Rainbow Stew."

Like any of that'll ever happen.

**He Wishes a Buck Was Still Silver (Not Really) and Likes the Taste of Yesterday's Wine (Really)**

In 1981, Ronald Reagan became president of the United States. Reagan's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again," trafficked in nostalgia for a 1950s America as yet unsullied by hippies, draft dodgers, and liberal kowtowing to special interests. "In the present crisis," Reagan warned in his inaugural address, "government is not the solution to our problem. Government _is_ the problem."

Faced with nearly 10 percent unemployment, chronic energy shortages, the national humiliation of the Iranian hostage crisis and more, Americans were desperate for less complicated times and eager to feel strong about themselves and their prospects for the future—anxieties paramount to a working class whose paychecks had been stagnant since the Nixon administration. And just as Nixon had earlier exploited country music, and Merle Haggard, to gain Silent Majority support, Reagan now used country music to woo that same bloc, now dubbed Reagan Democrats. Haggard, meanwhile, appeared willing once again to play along. Part of it was personal rather than political. Reagan had pardoned him in 1972, and Haggard returned the favor by performing several times at presidential events and, in at least one 1982 interview, endorsing the Reagan economic plan.

Once again, Haggard's music began to sing a tune a lot of Americans already were humming. A bustling modern shuffle, "Big City" was another #1 hit in 1982 and the title track for his Epic Records debut, an album that in its country music way sings the working man blues, Reagan-era edition, no less than did contemporaneous releases such as Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five's "The Message" or Bruce Springsteen's _Nebraska_. "Big City" found the Hag again longing to quit a life of "entirely too much work and never enough play." Except here, instead of lighting out for another town, Merle dreams, hippie-like, of dropping out entirely. "I'm tired of this dirty old city," he attests in a voice as weary as his audience felt. "Set me free," he demands, "somewhere in the middle of Montana." All he wants, he says, is just what pay he has coming, and "You can keep your retirement and your so-called Social Security." He pauses before "so-called," then curls his lip at the entitlement program's name like he's bitten into something rotten. "Big City! Turn me loose and set me free."

Country music's name rests upon a contrast between the presumably old-fashioned country, where life's hardscrabble but honest, and the big city, where bright lights turn people into wage-slaving strivers or lazy welfare dependents. Merle's chapters of the country narrative tell a somewhat different story. For one thing, he doesn't sing much about country living, and the rare exceptions are almost never paeans to pastoral life. Merle's in-the-country country songs are more like manifestoes to the idiocy of rural life—not in the sense of stupid or foolish, but in precisely the sense of provincial, isolated, individualistic, and tethered-by-mere-animal-necessity that Marx and Engels had in mind in their version of the workingman blues. "Tulare Dust," "Kern River," "Hungry Eyes," "California Cottonfields," "One Row at a Time" . . . these Haggard songs are all literally "country," but they're hardly what you'd call Odes to an Agrarian Kern.

Is there a country artist who sings about big cities more than Merle Haggard? I count two Miami songs in his catalogue, two New Orleans songs, a minimum of four Chicago songs, and at least three L.A. songs (including "Big City," inspired by West Hollywood, where he was recording at the time). He also has "New York City Blues" and "What's New in New York City," and "Here in Frisco" and "Return to San Francisco." He's cut live albums in Philadelphia and Anaheim and taken musical road trips to places like Tulsa, Modesto, and Bakersfield, which aren't _big_ cities, maybe, but are cities, just the same. His many factory-floor-to-barstool laments usually don't cite any city in particular but clearly take place in one—or, maybe more to the point, take place in all of them, every day.

The density of urban settings in the Haggard catalogue reflects the reality of the country audience, which had been moving cityward for the bulk of the twentieth century. Merle's "Big City" recognized common frustrations of that life, but Merle's proposed escape from the clutches of urban living, fending for himself in the middle of Big Sky Country, was pure fantasy—a fantasy, as country music historian Bill C. Malone writes, that "many working people may have shared, but that only someone like a millionaire singer could realize." Indeed, as a description of how people live today, or could live or should, the _Survivorman_ version of rugged individualism "Big City" offered would've been downright delusional if it were anything more than a daydreaming respite from the working man blues. To forge one's way, alone, in the middle of a wilderness, remains a potent ideal of American freedom, but Americans have long accepted that their chances of making a life for themselves are going to be much improved in town, where the people are.

As for Merle himself, he's noted in interviews that he doesn't even enjoy touring in Montana: Too cold.

You might say _Big City_ was one album-long daydream of dropping out of modern life altogether. "Stop the World and Let Me Off," Merle insists in a version of the old Carl Belew song that keeps going 'round and 'round just the same, spun ever harder by Mark Yeary's dizzying electric piano. Cut in July 1981 and produced by Haggard and Lewis Talley, _Big City_ found Merle not only dreaming Big Sky dreams, but longing to spend a few days riding the rails and living off the land in "Good Old American Guest." In "My Favorite Memory," the album's chart-topping first single, Merle scrunched his eyes tightly and lost himself in the past: "I guess everything changes," Merle sighs, "except what we choose to recall."

What Merle chooses to recall in the album's third hit single, "Are the Good Times Really Over (I Wish a Buck Was Still Silver)," seems to have him not only recalling the past, but lobbying for its return. He wishes a buck was still silver, that Nixon had never lied to us, that the country was still strong—"back before Elvis and the Vietnam War . . . the Beatles and 'Yesterday' . . . when a man could still work and still would." The precise date lines for these historical destinations are something of a moving target, but they line up with the 1950s consistently enough—the preferred golden age of Reagan nostalgia, that is, those good old Jim Crow days when Merle was in prison and when women, themselves under a kind of house arrest, "could still cook," as Haggard grouses, "and still would."

It's hard to take Merle's wish for a pre-Elvis world too seriously, coming just three years after his album-length tribute to the King, and considering the source, the same goes for Merle's wish in the song that "a joint" still meant merely a seedy dive. But the melody and music of "Are the Good Times Really Over" are serious as a death march—Markham's horn suggests "Taps" without ever playing it—and Merle drags his voice through the lowest notes he can. Is American greatness gone for good, Merle keeps wondering. "Are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell?"

And then something remarkable happens. In the record's final verse, his first person switches to third, and he answers his own questions—let's _stop_ rolling downhill, the good times _aren't_ over, and so on—with an optimism unprecedented in his career. In the years since, in concert, he's gone further. He often mocks some of his earlier complaints ("when a woman could still cook," he laughs these days, "and chop wood"), and he likes to repeat that final optimistic verse—"the good times ain't over"—sometimes several times—"the good times ain't over"—even going so far as to goose it with the exclamation point of a concluding key change. Does Haggard, temperamentally so downbeat and prone to expecting the worst, actually believe it? I think the point is that he very much wants to believe he does, and wants us to believe it too.

In August 1982, with _Big City_ still high on the album charts, Merle Haggard released a duet album, _A Taste of Yesterday's Wine_ , with George Jones, the singer most often cited as country music's greatest. Five months later, he released _Pancho & Lefty_, with Willie Nelson, a songwriter routinely short-listed as country music's greatest.

For these projects to emerge in such a rush and with such high-profile contemporaries was surprising. Haggard had no on-record track record of artistic co-billings where he wasn't literally the Man of the House. George and Willie, however, were Merle's artistic equals. What's more, if we allow not only for career-spanning artistry but country radio commercial clout, circa 1980, then the Possum and the Red-Headed Stranger were nearly the Hag's only artistic peers still standing.

Country may have played along with Reagan-era nostalgia, thematically speaking, but musically it was a new day. By the early 1980s, the Nashville Sound was on its deathbed. It had fought off serial in-house coups—Bakersfield, soul-infused countrypolitan, the Outlaws—and one by one, each challenge was synthesized into the whole. Significant, even radical, changes were recorded as links rather than breaks in the chain of tradition (though not without persistent accusations of "Chain breaker!"). This process would be ongoing. But right around the time Elvis died, and Merle left Capitol for MCA, the center of gravity in country music, steady for thirty or so years, began shifting to new sounds and sources and to a fresh generation of stars, producers, and session personnel. The old sounds persisted, to be sure—to varying degrees they persist yet—as would for a time the careers of many of the old stars. But they ceased to dominate the charts or define the music for new generations of fans.

For Haggard, Jones, and Nelson, the early 1980s was a period of transition, even as they were making some of the best and most popular music of their lives. Merle's _Big City_ was his first nonconcert, nonanthology album ever to go gold. Willie's _Always on My Mind_ was a chart-topping country album (his third in a year) and barely missed matching that feat on the pop chart; and George's last two LPs, _I Am What I Am_ and _Still the Same Ole Me_ , would go platinum and gold, respectively, the former including "He Stopped Loving Her Today," his signature recording. Now, though, and fairly or not (mostly not), these legends would no longer be considered state-of-the-art updaters but last-living links to a possibly dying tradition. Merle's recognition of his new status (with his first autobiography just out to make the case) accounts in part for why this notorious lone wolf was newly receptive to collaboration with Jones and Nelson, his friends, contemporaries, and fellow traditionalists.

George Jones and Willie Nelson have a great deal in common—they're Hall of Fame Texans of nearly identical vintage, for starters—but they're about as different as artists in the same genre can be. They're both country as can be, but they occupy opposite poles of the aesthetic. There are various overstated-but-still-helpful binaries to sketch the differences: George the interpreter versus Willie the songwriter; Jones's honky-tonk and hardcore twang versus Nelson's country-jazz and Tin Pan pop; George's carefully sculpted do versus Willie's couldn't-be-bothered braids. But the overstated binary that resonates most helpfully for me is an emotional one: hot versus cool.

George sings hot. He's emotionally present in the lyric, a slave in a sense to the song's particular passion; he takes the lyrics personally. Or it sure seems that way. His melismas hurt us because we believe they've hurt him, _are_ hurting him, even more. This isn't to suggest his vocals are absent of any emotional distance, any cooling irony, but he _leans_ hot. Jones's representative performances exhibit an earnest, some would say overwrought and, therefore, embarrassing, white working-class brand of clenched-jaw desperation he appears all but powerless to control.

Willie sings cool, breezy. His brittle voice can bare his broken hearts unreservedly, but Nelson tends to place himself not within the emotions of the song but just above them. Nelson's songs abound with wondrous writerly conceits—angels flying too near the ground; men conversing with windows and walls—and he sings them with self-conscious self-possession. His more guarded, on-stage approach comes with its own class connotations. His adoption of middle-class restraint keeps him from coming off unpolished or trashy.

The greatest singers, Haggard included, have the ability to touch both ends of this affective spectrum, even as they rest most of their weight upon one pole or the other. If Jones sang Nelson's "Crazy," he'd sound like it, just a little. When Nelson (or nearly anyone else, for that matter) sings "Crazy," he makes sure we know that "I'm crazy" is only a figure of speech. Merle sings like Jones and Nelson both, and differently than both, stuck once more somewhere between. Merle doesn't so much split the difference between emotional poles as he's split by them. What distinguishes his emotional territory from that of other great singers is the way we hear him straining for cool and failing. He aspires to a respect and acceptance that another class of people has placed beyond the reach of Oildale Okies. His tricks of poetic cool—silver wings, big cities—are as transparent and delightful as Nelson's, but somewhere along the road from conception to execution, from smooth Cali croon to hard Okie twang, his voice betrays him, turns defensive. This is perhaps Merle's singular power as a singer. The Hag mingles optimism with resignation, wants to have it both ways because both ways is how he feels. He's eager to try on a swinging, middle-class nonchalance, but those same blues inevitably swing him back home to Oildale, running hot all the way.

The opening track for George and Merle's _A Taste of Yesterday's Wine_ is the Willie Nelson–penned title track. George and Merle render it Willie cool, with lots of boozy, bluesy harmonies and on-the-road-again bonhomie: Merle (forty-five when the track was cut) runs into George (pushing fifty) somewhere out there on their never-ending tours, and invites him to sit down and talk over old times, to tell again the old stories. Looking back has always been a favorite activity of the middle-aged, and for middle-aged musical outlaws rehearsals of one's misspent youth come with the added enjoyment of solidifying legends. "Come sit down here with us and tell us your story," Merle grins across the table at George, but the only story they ever get around to telling is the one about how they like the old stories, how they love getting high on memory. The album's first single, "Yesterday's Wine" topped the country charts in early October.

Other tracks on the album lean hard to the hot, sometimes to a fault but revealingly even then. "Silver Eagle," a Freddy Powers song, gives Jones a chance to laud his singing partner, "this great American poet" of "the everyday working man's life." The song describes the life of a touring musician who's "loved by millions [but is] somehow . . . their prisoner," riding the highways in a "ten-wheeled aluminum cell." The tone is very serious. The song more than implies that his jailer is . . . us.

As self-referential star turns go, I usually prefer my woe-is-me in novelty form. The album's Haggard-penned second single, "C. C. Waterback," which peaked at #10 on the country charts a couple of weeks before Christmas, offers about the nosiest hangover cure you've ever heard, a recipe that includes, besides hair of the dog, a blaring Dixie blues trumpet and a lot of loud talk. Last night, during a party at Jones's place, Merle's woman drank so much "she couldn't find the door. She wound up in old Jonesy's bed and I wound up on the floor." Jonesy and the Hag crack up at that, so you can be pretty sure that "wound up" means nothing more scandalous than "passed out." That's their story, anyway, and in the song they're sticking to it. The record achieves a low-level riotousness—shouted asides; laughter louder than the jokes prompting it deserve; more Don Markham trumpet, too, brassier than before—and as the record fades, the party's on again.

All of the funny songs on _Yesterday's Wine_ , and there are several, are hot enough to burn. The closing "No Show Jones" goes a long way to dismissing the self-seriousness of many earlier cuts by dancing all over Jones's early-'80s notoriety for canceling performances and nearly killing himself with drink and drugs. Haggard was by all accounts doing his level best to keep up with Jones during these years. Leona Williams recalled that near the end of their marriage, Merle warned her: "Last year was Jones' time to fall apart. This year it's my turn." But even in the darkest periods of his life, Jones has remained a master of the lighthearted novelty, skimming along the silly surface of "Old King Kong" or "White Lightning," willing to come off like a big ol' goof for the benefit of a big ol' goofy song.

Not Merle, who seems incapable of sustaining a novelty mood. His jokes are usually at the expense of other people. On "Must've Been Drunk," the joke is on a woman from the Salvation Army who some night before tried to save George and Merle's souls by getting them to promise they'd set down the bottle. "Well, we must've been drunk, Hag, when we said we'd stop drinking," Jones reminds him, yelling and slurring to let us know he's off on another bender. When Jones passes back the bottle, the Hag shares his part of the tale, which is to mock the woman who tried to change him. "I rolled a smoke as she read us the scripture. St. Peter! St. Luke! St. Paul!" He snorts the names of the apostles like belches or curses, like punch lines to the very idea of reinvention, never mind salvation.

The darkest cut on the album has a very different sort of punch line. Another of his own songs, "I Think I've Found a Way," finds Merle singing about some girl who's gone but is still banging around in his head. Now, he tells George, he's figured out how to make it without her: "I think I found a way I can be happy." "Tell me, Merle," George begs, because of course he has his own pain to deal with. "All I have to do-oo-oo-oo-ooh . . . ," Merle explains—the record pauses a split second; wait for it . . .—"is die."

That's morbid even for country, and Merle eschews any hint of authorial distance. You want relief? Get a noose.

Funny shit.

_Pancho & Lefty_ was released in January 1983, several months after _A Taste of Yesterday's Wine_ , but had actually been completed five months before the Jones album. Epic held it back because Willie already had so many other albums in the can or already in the racks.

Billy Sherrill, producer for _Yesterday's Wine_ , must have struck Haggard as the antithesis of the hands-off Ken Nelson. Sherrill liked to be the boss of everything, from song selection to arrangements, sometimes even dictating specific licks or phrasing. So it's likely no coincidence that the equally headstrong Haggard worked with the producer only once more during his Epic tenure, when he sang a duet with Ray Charles for the Freddy Powers' song "Little Hotel Room" in 1984. Working conditions were far more relaxed on the _Pancho & Lefty_ sessions. Recording took place over five hazy nights at Nelson's Pedernales studio, with Merle living out of his tour bus. This duet album's producer, Chips Moman, had just served the same role during Nashville sessions for Willie's _Always on My Mind_ , and for the Haggard project he'd enlisted the same players. In fact, "Always on My Mind" itself was recorded in Texas when Nelson fell in love with it, suggested it to Merle for a duet, but couldn't sell him on the idea.

Nelson didn't give Merle a chance to pass on the song that became the duet project's title track. Near the end of the sessions, Willie's daughter played him a version of Emmylou Harris doing songwriter Townes Van Zandt's "Pancho and Lefty." Willie and Chips immediately set to recording it while Merle crashed on his bus, rousing him only when everything else was finished, at four a.m., to sing a single short verse. He tried to beg off until morning: "I'd been asleep about an hour, and I was completely bushed," he told journalist Tom Roland. "I couldn't get my bearings, and he had this song and it seemed like it was half a mile long. It had more words than any song I've ever seen in my life." Haggard did as he was told, figuring he'd rerecord his part later when he was more familiar with the song and more alert. But per Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski, when Merle mentioned that possibility during a round of golf the following day, Nelson just laughed: "Hell, the tape's already on the way to New York."

_Pancho & Lefty_ wasn't a duet album in the old school sense of two singers trading verses and sharing choruses, singing to one another and sharing a story and an experience, à la a classic duet team like Jones and Tammy Wynette or, for that matter, George and Merle on _A Taste of Yesterday's Wine_. _Pancho_ also isn't a duet album in the even older school sense of two men singing together in close harmony, in the manner of brother teams like the Louvins or Everlys. Merle and Willie barely join their voices here at all, close or otherwise.

There are two duets on the album. Merle and Willie sing "All the Soft Places to Fall" to one another as a "we," and at each chorus they join in worn harmony to confess that while "most of our lives we've been Outlaws" (with a fondness for "women, smoking, and good al-kee-hol"), they've now overdosed on young men's fun and want to settle down. Or at least to settle—for a family, freshly laundered linens, "and all the soft places to fall." This sounds like wishful thinking, and not just on the part of songwriter Leona Williams. The problem for Merle and Willie, after all, has never been an unwillingness to fall, as it were, into soft places: The trick's been sticking around those soft places any longer than sunup.

_Pancho & Lefty_'s other duet repeats the poor, put-upon Outlaw theme: "We keep roaring down the fast lane, like two young men feeling no pain," "laughing at the price tag that we've paid" is how Merle puts it in his own soft-places-seeking "Reasons to Quit." Reason #1: They've built up such a tolerance to "the smoke and booze" they have to stay high nearly all the time. Reason #5: It's tough to write decent songs while high. Not that any reason gains traction for long. "Reasons to Quit," the album's first single and a top ten country hit, is chased on the album by "No Reason to Quit," a Dean Holloway song that finds Merle claiming he knows he's man enough to put aside the bottle; he just needs something to motivate him, though that seems unlikely. On "It's My Lazy Day," he and Willie can't even summon the willpower to make a trip to the old fishing hole.

They trade verses back and forth on that one, their indolence encouraged by a mandolin that can barely find the strength to sound like a ukulele, and they trade them again, though without as much narrative sense, on Willie's cool conceit "Half a Man," and on the Jesse Ashlock–penned "My Life's Been a Pleasure." The division of labor is split more or less down the middle that way throughout. Each man gets two solo leads: Merle has "No Reason to Quit" and his lovely reading of Stuart Hamblen's "My Mary." Willie gets "Still Water Runs the Deepest" and a stunning piano-blues reading of "Opportunity to Cry," this duet album's Merle-less final word. That sequencing choice, coupled with the famously Merle-light title track—Nelson gets three verses there (plus four choruses) to Hag's one—makes _Pancho & Lefty_ feel like a Willie Nelson solo effort, though Merle does at least get top billing.

_Pancho& Lefty_ opens with "Pancho and Lefty," which itself opens with a manic ride cymbal and a cheesy synthesized piano intro that serves no discernible purpose, not even to establish mood, unless reminding that "It's the early 1980s!" counts as mood. And maybe it does: "Pancho and Lefty" starts like a dead-on-arrival-ringer for "Believe It or Not," the theme song to TV's _Greatest American Hero_ and a #2 pop hit the previous summer.

Fifteen seconds in, though, producer Moman punches reset, and the song shifts with we-interrupt-this-program abruptness. The intro's synthy piano dribbles to dust, and Willie takes the reins, his tenor made all the chillier by the song's distancing-by-definition third-person narrative. Van Zandt's song offers up a Pancho who maybe is or maybe isn't Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, but whoever he is, this Pancho is a "bandit boy" who eludes capture until he doesn't. Eventually, he's killed, probably by Lefty, who may or may not have been paid to do it by the Federales, but who in any event hightails it for a "cold" Cleveland the same day Pancho bites it in the "quiet" desert. Meanwhile, the few surviving Federales insist to anyone who'll listen (the lyric switches to first-person plural, twice, for the last line of the chorus, so apparently Willie is one of them?) that they could have laid Pancho low at will, but let him hang around instead "out of kindness." Or maybe, as I prefer, that's just the story they tell to save face. Or maybe Pancho's hanging around at the end of a rope? The song isn't so much rich with poetic ambiguity as it is incoherent—and things become even more muddled if you think the songwriter might help. Van Zandt said that as far as he was concerned his Pancho wasn't _the_ Pancho, yet his song drafts significance off the inevitable confusion: Why would " _the poets_ tell how Pancho fell" if he wasn't _the_ Pancho?

But that just means Van Zandt's famed story song is less interested in relating a specific story, per se, than in establishing cinematic atmosphere and articulating a way of feeling a hard world. On that front, Merle and Willie's record is both a turnoff and a seduction. The tone of the song—macho, pretentious, admiring of rebellion for its own sake, siding with an impulse toward rugged individualism and against anything bigger than the self, damn the lonely consequences—is more than a little grating. That's doubly the case coming from Willie and Merle, who use Van Zandt's tale of one dead outlaw and another dying one to sing a self-aggrandizing ode to the outlaw life of the touring musician and to their own widely admired skills for eluding capture: "Livin' on the road, my friend, was gonna keep you free and clean," Willie begins. Of course, the song sequels that young man's rainbow with the older and wiser "Now you wear your skin like iron, your breath as hard as kerosene," so I take critic Geoffrey Himes's point that this "push-and-pull of romantic notions and sobering reality" is a Van Zandt trademark. I'd only note that pushing and pulling through all that sobering reality—bravely, stoically, fatalistically—is many a romantic's idea of a pretty picture indeed. And never mind that Pancho (the famous historical one, I mean) remains a beloved folk hero in Mexico precisely because he faced those sobering realities in support of collective, not individual, freedom.

The record has undeniable power for all that. Once the sonics reboot and Willie settles into Van Zandt's elegiac melody, "Pancho and Lefty" laughs at my attempts at explication and just is. Each time I hear it, there comes a point, usually right about the time Moman's layered guitars start to mimic steel drums and just before Merle's dusty baritone comes sliding in, when the tune pulls from me a jumble of emotions, about diminished dreams and growing old and dying alone. Van Zandt's half a mile of mere words matter less with each syllable. Then "Pancho and Lefty" is like a siren's call to the universal human desire to "keep running from life," as Merle had put it a few years earlier—to be free by being free and clear. It's a reminder, too, for those who will hear, that you can never be free by yourself.

**"Kern River," 1985**

"Kern River" is a scary record, maybe the scariest I know, because its terror is just a synonym for the world. Country music has any number of scary songs that take place at river's edge, but unlike "Banks of the Ohio," say, where the singer plunges a knife into the chest of a woman who refuses to marry him, "Kern River" has neither a murderer nor a murder victim. No one takes his own life in the song, either; Merle doesn't sing as Hank Williams does in "Long Gone Lonesome Blues" of "going down in it three times but, Lord, I'm only coming up twice." The story Haggard tells in "Kern River" is so hopeless, its character so utterly powerless, that if its narrator did kill himself, it would feel like a perverse little victory for the human race. Spoiler alert: He doesn't kill himself.

At the dawn of what Ronald Reagan's reelection campaign only months before had called "Morning in America," Haggard's "Kern River" would come on the radio—it was a top ten hit in the summer of 1985—and it would suddenly feel like the sun had been punched from the sky, like it might never come up again. In a noisy country radio mix that might include the country-pop Exile declaring "She's a Miracle" without sounding miraculous, or Alabama singing "Forty Hour Week (For a Living)" like they'd never heard of the working man blues, Merle's record screamed quiet and startled you alive. "I'll never swim Kern River again," he almost whispers at the start, like someone or something might be eavesdropping. He's not singing a cappella but might as well be: What little music there is registers more like a barely beating heart than a band. "It was there that I met her," he sings, reviving the memory, trapped in images indistinguishable from every imprisoning moment since. "It was there that I lost my best friend."

She drowned in that river, he says, long ago, stolen by the Kern, a river "not deep nor wide but . . . a mean piece of water" and the real-world dividing line between Oildale and Bakersfield. Now, on the single, a woman's cold and bloated voice pursues him to the end of the record and beyond. "I may drown in still waters," he keeps saying in a way that lets us know he's considered it. "But I'll never swim Kern River again."

Listen long enough and you can even begin to believe that the song's most indelible line, a detail so small but that feels so enormous—"I may cross on the highway but I'll never swim Kern River again"—is expressing not an option Merle allows himself but a privilege that's somehow been granted to him. He _may_ cross on the highway, but right-of-way can be revoked without notice. The Kern, Mt. Whitney, Lake Shasta, the San Joaquin Valley—Merle moves about them all, but only as a bird flits in a cage, and he can't feel at home even in nature anymore. His dreams ("I grew up in an oil town but my gusher it never came in"), his movements ("The river was a boundary where my darling and I used to swim"), his very agency ("I live in the mountains, I drifted up here with the wind"), are beyond his control.

He did have this grim song to write and sing. But even his own craft—the alliteration and internal rhymes of "one night . . . moonlight . . . the swiftness swept her life"—can do nothing but slant inexorably toward doom.

**He's Going Where the Lonely Go**

Merle was living in California again in the Eighties, working obsessively, nose to grindstone, but dutifully doing his Nashville rounds. He recorded there, between long stints on the road, almost exclusively throughout the decade. In 1984, he informed _Music City News_ he was planning a Johnny Cash tribute album—it never happened, but three years earlier Johnny Paycheck had paid tribute to Merle on _Mr. Hag Told My Story_ , enlisting Mr. Hag himself, and his band too, to join him on a version of "I Can't Hold Myself in Line." In 1983, Merle even cut "Everybody Has the Blues" with Dean Martin, the cool crooner he'd had in mind when writing the song a decade earlier.

In just his first two years on Epic, Haggard released eight albums. In addition to the politically minded _Big City_ and its follow-up, the romantically minded _Going Where the Lonely Go_ (cut during the same forty-eight hours in July 1981), there were those three duet projects with George Jones, Willie Nelson, and, on Elektra, Leona Williams. Another solo effort, _That's the Way Love Goes_ , came in 1983: Its lovely, gratitude-practicing title track was among Lefty Frizzell's final compositions and Merle's thirty-second #1 country hit. The second holiday release of his career, _Goin' Home for Christmas_ , was sprinkled in there, too, as was a fourth live album, _The Epic Collection (Recorded Live)_. Unpromisingly titled, that one, but it was his tightest and most wide-ranging concert set yet, opening with a wild medley of two Capitol-era carousers, "Honky Tonk Night Time Man" and "The Old Man from the Mountain." He was constantly working.

Or constantly partying. In 1969, in Muskogee, folks may not have made "a party out of lovin'," but by the mid-'80s, on Merle's Lake Shasta houseboat, they'd grown more open-minded. "A famous female country music star and I once spent five days nude on the boat," Merle writes in the opening chapter to _House of Memories_. "We snorted drugs the entire time and didn't go to sleep once." That second autobiography is stuffed with tales of similar debauchery, unspooled amidst serial crises. Some of those were rich man's problems like fraudulent promoters and financially catastrophic investments, but most of Merle's troubles were of the decidedly everyman variety. His mother, Flossie Haggard, passed in 1983. In 1986, Merle's dear friend, producer, and longtime manager Lewis Talley died unexpectedly, too (cardiac arrest, on the houseboat), and in 1987, Roy Nichols, Merle's boyhood hero, and his collaborator since the Wynn Stewart days, announced he was retiring from the road due to ill health. Somewhere in there Merle married his fourth wife, Debbie Parret, his longtime road cook and housekeeper, then almost immediately began spending time with Theresa Lane, who became his fifth wife, though not until 1993.

The Eighties were turbulent years for Merle. And, perhaps inevitably, the music suffered, though less in quality than significance. Often working with producer Ray Baker, Merle developed a new radio-friendly ballad style, built around electric keys, sax, and pulsating bass with room enough to live between each jazzy note. But as Haggard's sonic options grew, his themes contracted. By the middle of the decade, Merle had settled comfortably into a new role as a first-rate singer of sometimes soaring or sexy, but more often sad and sullen, love songs. The titles of his singles tell the story: "Going Where the Lonely Go," "You Take Me for Granted," "What Am I Gonna Do (with the Rest of My Life)," "That's the Way Love Goes," "Someday When Things Are Good," "Let's Chase Each Other around the Room," "A Place to Fall Apart," and "I Had a Wonderful Time" were all top five or better between 1983 and 1986. The best of a strong bunch was "Natural High," on which Merle, assisted by singer Janie Fricke, fashions a Nashville equivalent to R&B's Quiet Storm.

This was honorable, necessary work. Set beside the music he'd made in the Nixon years, though, and during Reagan's first term—that work had been big as history, and had made it—most of what Haggard did in the mid-to-late 1980s felt small. It recognized a narrower range of human concern. Not that the country audience was encouraging him to widen it up. A pair of patriotic in-concert singles from 1985—"American Waltz" and "Amber Waves of Grain"—were as clichéd as campaign videos, and as ignored. Much better was the following year's "Out among the Stars," an Adam Mitchell song that returned Merle to twinned specialties—working-class desperation ("He can't find a job, but man, he's found a gun") and shame ("His father cries, 'We'll never live this down'"). But that wasn't what radio wanted from Merle Haggard anymore.

"Oh, how many travelers get weary, bearing both their burdens and their scars," Merle worries, his voice soaring, then cracking, in sympathy as E Street keyboards shimmer and soar behind him. "Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining and fly like eagles out among the stars?" In December of 1986, it peaked at #21.

After _Big City_ , Haggard's albums in the Eighties were never great, but always solid, some more rewarding than others. A few highlights among many . . . _Out among the Stars_ found Merle riding lush strings and counting his blessings in "My Life's Been Grand," then momentarily indulging rainbow dreams in a brassy, hard-swinging, and smartly phrased "Pennies from Heaven." Nineteen eighty-seven's _Chill Factor_ , Merle's here's-how-to-do-it contribution to the era's New Traditionalist movement, included the misery-accepting top ten title track, the misery-rejecting "We Never Touch at All," and what turned out to be his final #1 hit, "Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star," which merged Haggard's mature '80s style with the 1950s doo-wop classicism of the Elegants' "Lucky Star." His final Epic album, 1988's _5:01 Blues_ , was too enamored of Jimmy Buffet–ish island rhythms but did include the searching "Someday We'll Know," maybe Merle's finest ballad since "Somewhere Between" twenty years earlier.

In 1987, five years after _Pancho & Lefty_, Merle and Willie released a sequel, _Seashores of Old Mexico_. The title track reprised a number Merle had first cut in 1974, in which Merle gets a lift from peasants "in route to a town I can't say." (Not because he's being cagey; it's just his Spanish needs work.) There was also Willie's and Merle's exquisitely lonesome take on Blaze Foley's exquisitely lonesome "If I Could Only Fly" and an ethereal reenvisioning of "Silver Wings." Merle's solo flight through his own "Without You on My Side" seemed to pack an entire worldview into a single preposition: Merle needs us not _at_ or _by_ his side but _on_ it.

And there's "Yesterday." I remember just staring at my speakers the first time I heard it, not long after _Seashores_ was released. The first shock of "Yesterday" is that Merle's singing it. Hadn't he wished, only a few years ago, that we still lived "before the Beatles and 'Yesterday'"? But the second shock is bigger. Merle's voice is suddenly high and cracked and frail. His rich baritone, in especially fine form on _Seashores_ ' every other track, feels like it's been unexpectedly pumped with air and left out overnight in the chill and damp. His phrases, which normally snap off crisply or, more often, fade slowly like a sunset, here merely crumple. This thin thread of a voice didn't sound like Merle at all. Was he sick? Wasted, or wasting away? Like the grandpa character he played on _Goin' Home for Christmas_ but stripped of all playfulness, Merle's voice on "Yesterday" was the voice of an old man.

Willie's here too, doing his normal Willie thing, phrasing at sharp, unpredictable angles through each chorus and sounding ageless; Merle sings the verses. Zen master Willie observes each regret, feels its not unpleasant sting, releases it. Merle sounds like he's pacing a crowded cage, imprisoned by, and with, his past. Now, he _believes_ in "Yesterday," because each regret's inseparable from who he's become. Mistakes and wrong turns pile up like bricks here in the present, burden upon burden, a barrier so high it places out of reach even the notes he's trying to hit.

Twenty years later, when the Hag really was an old man with an old man's voice—indeed, when he'd had a cancerous piece of lung removed, and part of his range with it—Merle's "Yesterday" voice returned for keeps. But how could he have known that in 1987? Merle had always been a gifted mimic, but how could we have known that "Yesterday" would be the then-fifty-year-old Haggard's greatest impersonation yet? Ladies and gentlemen, his voice said, Merle Haggard . . . at seventy.

**"Me and Crippled Soldiers," 1990**

In August 1990, at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia, Merle Haggard and George Jones played a double bill. A small group of inmates from the Missouri State Penitentiary in nearby Jefferson City were bussed in for State Fair performances to set up rows of folding chairs between stage and grandstand and to stack them up again when the concert was over. In between, they got to watch the show, staring down at the musicians from tall scaffolding on one side of the stage.

Former prisoner Haggard closed that show, the first time I'd seen him live. Beyond a general sense of feeling amazed by the strength of his singing and the Strangers' hard swing, what I remember most was what happened when he played "Me and Crippled Soldiers," the B-side to his latest single. An anti-flag-burning flag-waver, it was Merle's response to recent Supreme Court decisions affirming flag burning as constitutionally protected speech. Merle wasn't buying it, and neither was his audience. When the crowd discerned what this new Merle song was about, they rose as one to honor flag and country, holding aloft flickering, disposable Bic lighters in approval. My friends and I remained seated, our little protest in support of free speech.

One sign of a vital song or recording is that you want to talk back to it. When Merle complains that "Now that it's all right to burn the Stars and Stripes . . . we might as well burn the Bill of Rights as well," you could complain, if you wanted, that he wasn't making sense: What good is a Bill of Rights if you can't practice the liberties it enshrines? Likewise, when Merle asks . . .

_Has the Holocaust been so long?_

_Is Hitler really gone?_

_As we burn our only cause for Vietnam?_

you could tell Merle his comparison's idiotic. Or, playing the record at home, you can hear Merle sing . . .

_I've been known to wave the flag before_ ,

_And [been] saddened when we went to war_ ,

_fighting for the symbol of our land . . ._

and you can patiently explain to Merle, or impatiently shout, that fighting to defend one's country and fighting to defend a _symbol_ of one's country are very different things, only one of which is ever worth dying for. In the song, Merle shakes his head at those Supreme Court decisions and wonders, "Is _this_ the freedom that we won?" And you can answer him very simply: "Yes."

Or you could not answer him at all. Even Merle didn't sound terribly invested in his dudgeon. No matter how many times he sang "only me and crippled soldiers give a damn," the record never insisted we give a damn about it the way Merle's earlier anthems had. Lyrics aside, that was because "Me and Crippled Soldiers" wasn't a very good record. Children's voices (our future!) provide oddly creepy, metronomic harmonies throughout. A Salvation Army–sounding brass band (emphasis on Army) blows briefly about the middle of the recording, suggesting "The Star Spangled Banner" and "Stars and Stripes Forever," and "Bringing in the Sheaves," and "Dixie" too, while failing to connect you to any of them. Merle's Bakersfield licks, normally switchblade sharp, have been processed into butter knives, and the riled-up rhythm of the like-minded "Fightin' Side of Me" has been beaten to a plod. Illogical, lifeless as a corpse, "Me and Crippled Soldiers" might be the nadir of the Haggard catalogue.

But that's the record. In Sedalia, Missouri, that night, there was no denying the song's power, and there was no talking back, no conversation, only coercion. Throughout Jones's part of the show and into Haggard's set, I'd exchanged appreciative glances and a couple of high-fives with several large, happily drunken men behind us who were enjoying themselves at least as much as my friends and I. But, when they noticed we hadn't stood up with the rest of the crowd, they not so subtly made us understand that we should stand up too, unless we wanted our asses kicked.

Well, you pick your battles. . . . When a few more gentlemen in the row in front of us, almost as large and nearly as drunk, allowed that ass-kicking sounded like a plan to them, we figured out that this was a battle we had no chance of winning. Outsized and outnumbered, we swallowed our pride and stood up. We did as we were told and celebrated our freedom.

It was dark by then, and as Merle finished his song, I caught sight of the prisoners' silhouettes above the stage. I remember watching them up there on their scaffolding and how the ends of their lit cigarettes dimmed and glowed and dimmed like stars.

**The Hag versus the Man in Black**

As the 1980s came to a close, Merle Haggard had been among country music's biggest stars, and arguably its major figure, for nearly a quarter of a century. In the 1990s, however, Haggard was, for all practical purposes, a no-show—and in a decade when country music was more popular and diverse than it had ever been.

The Nineties will go down in country music history for two closely related developments. Most prominently, the decade saw the rise of a wildly successful radio format, and eponymous modern sound, called Hot New Country. Major performers of the style included the soft-rock-influenced Garth Brooks and the hard-rock-influenced Shania Twain, two country stars who moved units like the pop stars they also were. Representative Hot New Country records included Billy Ray Cyrus's "Achy Breaky Heart" and Brooks & Dunn's "Boot Scootin' Boogie," which together helped fuel a line-dancing craze. Hot New Country, or HNC, as it was known, was studio-slick, cul-de-sac-identified, and arena-loud. HNC was for the millions of lifelong country fans seeking new sounds to navigate their new material conditions and was embraced, as well, by millions of Americans who'd never before thought of themselves as country fans but did now. As it had during the Muskogee Moment, and had again during the days of the Urban Cowboy, country became in the '90s part of the popular culture of a large portion of the American middle class, increasing slightly the visibility of the music's working-class base in the process.

HNC wasn't loved by all country fans, however, which brings us to the decade's other significant country music development, the emergence of what came to be known as Alternative Country. Composed of a small, loose community of backward-glancing fans and musicians, the "alt.country movement," generally speaking, deemed vintage sounds to be "raw" and "authentic," and it cursed as "overproduced" and "suburban" any country of the Hot and New type, which it allowed had destroyed "real" country music. Exemplars here included the Waco Brothers, one of the genre's smartest and hardest-rocking outfits, and their "The Death of Country Music," a besotted eulogy that summarized the subgenre's sense of betrayal at what country music had become: "We spill some blood on the ashes/of the bones of the Joneses and the Cashes." That emotion was seconded by singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks, who flipped the bird at modern country's "moron market" in one exaggeratedly twangy record called "F——k This Town": "This ain't country-western/It's just soft-rock feminist crap." Hot New Country, loved most dearly by working-class folk who'd only recently shoved their way into the middle class, walked on the fightin' side of Alternative Country, predominantly a music of middle-class college rockers who'd begun to slum, however sincerely, in the blue-collar back catalogues of people like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard.

In 1994, Johnny Cash used Alternative Country's brief cachet to rise from the dead. During the Muskogee Moment, Cash had been about the only country act to outshine Haggard, but his star had dimmed considerably in the years since—in 1987, Columbia had dropped Cash outright after twenty-eight years on the label, causing Merle to protest loudly (Epic, still his label at the time, was a Columbia subsidiary) and to begin fearing for his own career.

Released in the spring of 1994, _American Recordings_ gave Cash his career back. Not because it included any big singles or was a monster seller. Rather, Cash's new work provoked immediate critical acclamation like he'd never seen. _American Recordings_ was "a milestone work" ( _Los Angeles Times_ ), "a breathtaking blend of the confessional and the self-mythologising" ( _Mojo_ ), "an instant classic" ( _Rolling Stone_ ).

The album was sweet and scary, bracing. Then again, pop music is littered with great albums that have gone mostly unappreciated, so the all-but-unanimous enthusiasm that greeted _American_ had at least as much to do with fortuitous timing, and sound marketing, as with the music itself. Cash made _American Recordings_ alongside rap/metal producer Rick Rubin, a collaboration that won the project rebel cred before anyone ever heard a note. The disc's savvy cover (Cash looming like a backwoods version of Bergman's Death), as well as its several savvy covers (Cash sings Waits! Cohen! Danzig!), intensified that effect, and the album's lo-fi sound and minimalist settings sealed the deal. The project's much-repeated backstory—this was just the Man in Black singing songs of violence and self-immolation, strumming simple guitar on Rick Rubin's couch—mattered greatly to listeners predisposed to believe that sparser arrangements were more authentic arrangements, that darker emotions and subjects were self-evidently the best, most real emotions and subjects. Cash's realness was the album's primary draw: Johnny Cash, punk rocker! Johnny Cash, Original Gangsta! The comparisons were facile, but the enthusiasm was undeniable. Cash's old-school moves were received with an of-this-very-moment urgency.

Like a detail from an epic landscape painting, _American_ offered a revealing though only partial view of Cash's art. Nonetheless, a Cash renaissance was a welcome development. The album, along with the several name-brand sequels it inspired, was particularly important within the Alternative Country scene. _American_ 's dark and stormy themes reinforced the movement's preexisting one-dimensional appreciation for both Cash and the country tradition. Its troubadourish approach expanded what would pass for cool going forward, and the bare-bones arrangements flattered the burgeoning community's own rejection of glossy Nashville.

As Cash was being reborn, Haggard was slipping away.

A couple of weeks before the release of _American Recordings_ , Merle Haggard released an album of his own. Not that anyone noticed. The new album, _1994_ , announced itself as literally up-to-date, but its music sounded merely dated. With several songs written by Nashville ringer Max D. Barnes, and all of it recorded with cavernous-sounding blues-rock guitar and big drums, _1994_ found Merle trying very hard, in a Hot New sort of way, to land a hit. But country radio no longer had any use for an old-timer like Haggard, no matter how contemporary his records sounded. Younger rock fans, meanwhile, who were just discovering Cash and other alternative countries, and who might have been inclined to check out a similarly craggy legend like Merle Haggard, would've likely been deaf to _1994_ 's contemporary sounds even if they'd heard them.

This is just the way it would go for Haggard in the Nineties, by any measure the low point of his career. For one thing, he was facing major financial difficulties. As he told journalist Robert Price, "I had earned maybe a hundred million dollars in 25 years. By 1990, I was practically broke." For another, he'd grown dissatisfied with his longtime label. He left Epic Records in 1989 because he was angry about the way Cash had been treated, because he felt increasingly anonymous there, and because the label had shown little enthusiasm for "Me and Crippled Soldiers." He signed to Curb Records the following year, yet that was disappointing from the start. "Crippled Soldiers" was promptly released, but only as the B-side to "When It Rains It Pours," a generic ballad that straight out of the gate became the lowest-charting Merle Haggard single ever.

His subsequent debut album for Curb sold as poorly, and got what it deserved. In addition to "Crippled Soldiers," 1990's _Blue Jungle_ included two more songs pulled from Reagan-Bush-era headlines—specifically, news reports of a homelessness epidemic. Yet beside earlier masterpieces on the subject, these new songs looked like Merle Haggard forgeries. Next to "Hungry Eyes," "Under the Bridge" was pure fantasy, its version of homelessness scrubbed clean of pain and dirt, want or death, while "My Home Is in the Street" gave up on the hard-knock lessons of "I Take a Lot of Pride" to channel Little Orphan Annie optimism. The rest of _Blue Jungle_ wasn't much better. The album's relative standouts—"Sometimes I Dream," "A Bar in Bakersfield" (what if, the song imagines, Merle had never made it big), a glossy new version of "Driftwood"—stood out mainly because everything else sounded so dreary and, topical numbers notwithstanding, so old.

Merle continued to write and record, but it would be four long years before he had a new record—and this from an artist who'd once shoehorned seven albums into twenty-three months. Haggard took to bitching in interviews that Curb was happy enough to use his name for bait, luring future stars like Tim McGraw to the label, but that it wouldn't release his music. When it finally showed up, _1994_ improved considerably on _Blue Jungle_. "Set My Chickens Free" was agreeably funky in both the odd and the on-the-one senses, while a remake of "Ramblin' Fever," solo-crammed and stretched to four minutes, challenged HNC on its own rocking terms and, if only aesthetically, won. But the album was nowhere near strong enough to overcome another dud of a first single: Barnes's slushy "In My Next Life," about a man who works until his hands are no longer fit to use, but is eager to get back to it up in heaven. Then again, not much could have withstood the album's afterthought title, Curb's scant promotion, and undercooked cover art—just "Merle Haggard" and, smaller, "1994," in grey type against an all-black background.

_1994_ entered the country charts the first week of April, inched its way to #60 (lowest-charting Merle Haggard album, ever), and was gone by the first week of May. That commercial failure carried over to the road, where venues got smaller—"honky tonks and army bases," as he put it in one _1994_ cut, "Troubadour." Merle could no longer count even on headlining. His two hands were still fit to use, though, so he kept at it, singing "everybody's favorite song . . . warming up the crowd for some big star . . . trying to keep my name up there in lights"

For just a second there, things turned back Haggard's way. On October 5th, during the nationally televised Country Music Awards, Haggard was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Emmylou Harris led the celebration, singing the opening to "Hungry Eyes" and narrating a brief bio that included a priceless clip: Merle rising to accept Entertainer of the Year honors, in 1970, his shoulders being squeezed from behind by a beaming Johnny Cash. Harris next introduced a group of current Nashville stars who offered a "Workin' Man Blues" that was described as "a good old country jam"—workmanlike, that is, and proud of its apprenticeship. Finally, Harris presented the award: "In some ways his life sounds like fiction, but if it were fiction no one would believe it . . ." Cue standing "O."

Merle's acceptance speech was perfectly in character. Rather than thanking a country music industry that applauded him tonight but wouldn't play his records come morning, he made a point of recognizing first "my plumber out in Palo Cedro . . . for doing a wonderful job on my toilet." It wasn't "f——k this town," but it was pretty close.

The week following his Hall of Fame induction saw the release of _Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard_. The various-artists collection gave several of Merle's biggest hits the mainstream Nashville treatment, with mostly solid results from the likes of Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, Alabama, and Randy Travis. Brooks & Dunn contributed a version of "The Bottle Let Me Down" that seemed to have nothing at all to do with the failures of self-medication, but that had everything to do with helping folks achieve an equally worthy end, scooting their boots.

Only a couple of weeks later, a second collection was released, _Tulare Dust: A Songwriters' Tribute to Merle Haggard_. It featured a lineup of like-minded Americana cohorts—Peter Case, Lucinda Williams, Marshall Crenshaw, John Doe, etc.—most of them traveling light, guitar and voice only. The spare approach fit skimpy indie recording budgets, but did aesthetic work, too: Less-is-more signified less is more _real_. On that score, the _Tulare_ acts were of a piece with Cash's _American Recordings_ , and in line with alt.country sensibilities generally, favoring a closer–to–deep catalogue version of Haggard's songbook. _Mama's Hungry Eyes_ had the obvious classics—"Mama Tried," "Sing Me Back Home," "Workin' Man Blues," "Today I Started Loving You Again," and the title cut, among others—just as you'd have figured it would. _Tulare Dust_ skipped those, choosing off the charts instead (Joe Ely, for instance, sounding sick to death but getting used to it on "White Line Fever") or at least choosing less frequently anthologized hits like "My Own Kind of Hat" or "Kern River."

Indeed, _Mama's Hungry Eyes_ and _Tulare Dust_ testified to the sheer quantity of quality material in the Haggard songbook. Together, the discs took in an impressive thirty songs, with only "Silver Wings" redundant. But the discs also argued for competing conceptions of what the country music tradition still meant to people at century's end, of the ways it might continue to matter, and to whom, in the coming millennium. On _Mama's Hungry Eyes_ , Haggard was an esteemed forefather whose past contributions would be honored and appreciated, though fleetingly and with perhaps more duty than devotion. It climbed to #52 on the country album chart, a nice showing for a project raising money for Second Harvest Food Bank. _Tulare Dust_ , meanwhile, intended for an audience all but invisible to country radio, and whose creators liked it that way, didn't chart at all. That was bad news for Haggard, long accustomed to chart dominance and the cultural impact and more lucrative bookings that accompany it. The good news was that the acts on _Tulare Dust_ thought Haggard still had something to say: His songs were old tools with plenty of use left.

At the same time, the Americana community understood that Merle Haggard would be, for many in its audience, an iffy reclamation project—and, just as it had been for earlier generations of country-infatuated rockers, the barriers to be overcome were named "Okie" and "Fightin' Side." In liner notes to _Tulare Dust_ , contributing artists (and executive producers) Tom Russell and Dave Alvin were effusive in their praise but a little defensive: "Detractors often dredge up 'Okie from Muskogee' or 'Fightin' Side of Me' as evidence of exaggerated patriotism, but they've missed the point." The point being, apparently, that they hated those songs, too, but liked his other ones a lot. For any Hag-appreciating rocker with political and cultural affinities to the left of, say, Hank Williams Jr., redirection was just a rule of the road.

Much less common were alt.country acts like the Starkweathers, who, in the final verse of their "Burn the Flag," backsassed Merle directly in a way that was tough to miss: "If you don't love it, _change_ it!" That, too, came in 1994. Haggard just kept coming up like that all year long—as inheritance, sounding board, inspiration—both out on the alternative fringes and smack in the HNC mainstream. A week after _Tulare Dust_ arrived in stores, Nashville hit maker Ricky Van Shelton released _Love and Honor_ , its title track on loan from Merle's 1974 _If We Make It through December_. Also that fall, Clint Black, whose "I Take a Lot of Pride" had been a _Mama's Hungry Eyes_ standout, enjoyed a top five country hit with "Untanglin' My Mind," a song he and Merle had written together. As 1994 came to a close, it seemed everything was pointing to a Haggard renaissance in 1995 of the sort Johnny Cash was already enjoying.

But if Merle had any shot at a Johnny Cash–style comeback, he missed out for the simple reason that he never showed up for the party. After the tributes, it was almost two years before Haggard released another album—and even fans on the lookout for a new record likely missed it. Merle's third album for Curb did worse than the first two, neither charting nor producing a charting single. Country music critic, journalist, and historian Michael McCall summarized the situation this way:

His record company didn't send promotional copies to reviewers until the album had been out for nearly a month, and no advertising or promotion has been devoted to the music. The album artwork and cover reflect this lack of care: the title, _1996_ , is boxed on the cover like a tomb, exactly like Hag's last set, _1994_.

In fact, the only difference between this cover and the preceding one was that the color scheme had been reversed from grey on black to black on grey—ashy and dull either way. Merle was enraged by the lack of support. He called out label chief Mike Curb in interviews ("He tried to kill my career any way he could") and even challenged his nemesis to a public boxing match. To be a singer and a writer with next to zero chance of being heard was maddening enough. That _1996_ boasted several strong new originals only compounded the frustration. A pair of updated Singing Brakeman–styled numbers, "Truck Driver's Blues" and "Sin City Blues," sang rueful call-and-response with the road, while "Beer Can Hill," about growing up drunk and disorderly in Bakersfield, found Merle joyriding through Oildale with Buck Owens, Dwight Yoakam, and the Cajun accordion of Merle's coproducer, Abe Manuel Jr.

Best of all was Merle's take on a ballad by Iris DeMent. Wowed by her keening version of "Big City" on _Tulare Dust_ , Merle had sought the singer out and fallen for her song "No Time to Cry." Cutting it himself let Merle wave from a distance to the off-the-charts country scene where DeMent was much beloved, but Merle's attraction to the song was personal. De-Ment had written "No Time to Cry" about the death of her father—"There beside my mother in the living room I stood, with my brother and my sister knowing Dad was gone for good"—and about the busy numbness of her life after his funeral. Merle recognized that pain and made it his own, ticking off commitments and responsibilities, a world of toil and tragedy ("The baby that was missing was found dead in a ditch today"), of another show to do and no time even to weep. "Now I'm walkin' and I'm talkin' doing what I'm s'posed to do-oo," he croons, barely in control. "Working overtime to make sure I don't come unglued." He changes what DeMent remembers from "when I was a girl" to "before there was a Merle," then snorts at his joke. Or grunts in agony, it's hard to say. Once again, someone had told Merle's story in a song.

_1996_ was his best work since leaving Epic nearly a decade before, but almost no one heard it. After the tributes and Hall of Fame announcement, it had seemed Haggard, with the right song and a bit of promotion, might yet find the footing to climb back onto the radio or at least to catch a ride on Cash's train to Americana glory. There was even a four-disc, career-spanning box set to build on: 1996's essential _Down Every Road: 1962–1994_. But there would be no renaissance for Haggard as long as he was on Curb. Those tombstone-like covers to _1994_ and _1996_ felt like markers for a career that was dead and buried.

Johnny Cash had been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame all the way back at the beginning of his own career downturn, in 1980, and had joined the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, two years before his Rick Rubin–assisted comeback elevated him to a level of pop culture immortality few artists have attained. Though his sensibility is country to the core, Cash came through that slender 1950s window when boom-chuck country boogie overlapped with rockabilly rebellion, and that fortuitously timed entrance, succeeded by an appreciation for rock songwriters like Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, helped put him on the short list of country acts embraced by the larger pop audience. As _Rolling Stone_ asked in the summer of 1994, "Can you name anyone in this day and age who is as cool as Johnny Cash?"

In an alternative universe, the answer might have been, "Well, there's Merle Haggard." The two had much in common. The San Quentin–incarcerated Haggard had considered Cash a role model ever since he saw the star perform at San Quentin on New Year's Day 1958, though it wasn't until 1964 or thereabouts that they'd met face-to-face. They were in the basement bathroom of a Chicago television station when Cash offered the kid "a double dot, a little old Dexedrine pill and a drink of wine." From there, Johnny became Merle's friend, advisor, and booster: Cash booked him twice for his TV show and encouraged Merle to come out of the ex-con closet; the pair were chart contemporaries at a time when the charts amplified national conversations by speaking in the more-or-less common language of pop-and-country-radio hits. The Man in Black and the Hag were kindred artistic personas, too, "outlaws" long before that term became a highly remunerative pop-country marketing category.

But Haggard was never going to be cool like Cash. At heart, Cash is a latter-day American romantic—like Mark Twain, he's into local color mostly for the tall tales—and over the breadth of his career, he's presented himself as a somber prophet who was, simultaneously and without contradiction, a corn-loving cutup. People allowed Cash his moral gravitas, sought it out even, because his judgments felt forgiving and because his righteousness came sugarcoated with backslapping laughter. The Man in Black is always edging toward symbol and myth, and his story songs hint, optimistically, at the possibility of a more moral, more intense and adventure-filled, more consequential life for us all. The Man in Black starts down-to-earth but soars.

The Hag looks to fly, but remains earthbound in the end. He's life-sized, circumscribed, life as it is, a realist—and like a character out of Crane or Dreiser, the Hag is most often not part of something bigger than himself so much as swept away by forces beyond his control. In the 1990s, Cash's life story spoke directly, inspiringly, to Alternative Country fans like me who'd been raised up blue collar, had maybe gone and got ourselves college-educated, but were on the lookout for ways to stay connected to the best part of roots we'd otherwise fled. Cash's catholic taste, in sounds and songs and collaborators, flattered those of us who liked to think wide-ranging record collections were proof of an evolved broad-mindedness generally. By evoking a past presented as folklore, Cash seemed living proof that even if you got above your raising, you could look back without looking down—and move ahead without too much of the shame and other hard feelings associated with a wrong-side-of-the-tracks youth. The Man in Black promised both the acceptance and the transcendence of one's roots.

Merle Haggard had risen, too, but because his music and image worked overtime not to let on, the Hag seemed a less likely role model for reconciliation. Glancing over his shoulder at a still touchable past from a point of view grounded unmistakably in Right Now, Haggard warned that the old stories of class division and prejudice weren't old in the least. His themes and Okie accent were relentless, merciless reminders—for those of us, that is, who had the memories and didn't appreciate their revival—of rigid kinfolk and white trash humiliation, of prayers for change unanswered, of ditch-digging dads whose hands were no longer fit to use but who had to get up for work in the morning just the same. Haggard, the man or the persona, wasn't real-er than Cash any more than his music was more authentic. But for some alt.country types who'd been born and bred blue collar, had gotten away and wanted to stay gone—and, too, for many Hot New Country fans who hadn't gone to college but knew in present tense the sting of redneck stereotypes—Merle Haggard's brand of country music hit just a little too close to the old home place. Cash's southern trash exoticism has been tamed—by his for-the-whole-family television series, his comparatively progressive politics, the totality of his iconic persona. But for those without a life history rooted in the white working class, Haggard remained threatening and a little scary. It is not a coincidence that the class divide of Nineties country—working-class HNC versus middle-class alt—is exactly the divide replicated in the audiences of the Hag and the Man in Black.

In 2000, on Cash's third American album, _Solitary Man_ , Merle joined his old friend on a song called "I'm Leavin' Now." They trade verses to begin with, each announcing with exaggerated bravado that he's had it and will be hitting the road just as soon as he finishes this song. "Get out of my face, get out of my space, I'm leavin' now," they sing at the end, together, though they sound headed in different directions: Cash, taking off because there are still so many places to see, pop culture immortality at the top of the list; and Haggard not bound anywhere in particular, but running, always running.

**If He Could Only Fly**

Merle Haggard in the Twenty-First Century

_Watching while some old friends do a line_

_Holding back the want-to in my own addicted mind . . ._

The Nineties had been a lost decade for Haggard, but with these opening lines to 2000's _If I Could Only Fly_ , his first album of new material in four years, Haggard seemed instantly to have found himself. And to have been found. _If I Could Only Fly_ came out on the independent Anti-label, a fit that was just odd enough—a country Hall of Famer on a punk label?—and just right enough—isn't a drug-using musical outlaw a kind of a rocker, after all?—that it was bound to pique the interest of the rock press, college radio, and other Americana-friendly outlets. Hag's comeback prompted comparisons to Johnny Cash's ongoing collaboration with Rick Rubin, the most relevant similarity being that Haggard was making the music he wanted to make and country radio could go to hell. There were no hit singles on the album, and no attempts at one.

As it turned out, that anticommercial approach paid commercial results. In fact, _If I Could Only Fly_ did approximately as well on the Hot Country Album Chart (making it as high as #26, lasting twenty-seven weeks) as Cash's _American Recordings_ had done (#23, for twenty-two). It was a big comedown for an act with fifteen #1 country albums to his credit (second only to Haggard-fanatic George Strait) and more top ten entries than any country act ever. But after those underperforming Curb albums— _1996_ had been such a nonevent it hadn't charted at all— _If I Could Only Fly_ was a very big hit.

Did I mention it was also Haggard's best work in years, since at least 1987's _Chill Factor_ and maybe even since _Big City_ all the way back in '81? Those arresting first lines were to "Wishing All These Old Things Were New," a Haggard original that found him fighting the urge to sniff coke with pals. Not running from the urge but standing his ground, facing and fighting it, and the song also had him massaging old wounds reopened when watching young men do a perp walk ("and they show it all on TV, just to see somebody fail"). Haggard's craggy, strained voice makes certain we understand how glad he is to see those days gone, but also hinted that he half wished that they weren't, maybe more than half. Other old things he missed in the song included some he'd never experienced, such as "good times like the Roaring Twenties," when Jimmie Rodgers walked the earth, and others he most definitely had out on his houseboat: "the Roaring Eighties, too!"

"That was before it all fell through," he groaned, invoking his not-so-roaring Nineties. Not that the decade had been all bad. He'd remarried in 1993, to longtime girlfriend Theresa Lane, and he'd become a father twice more. This fresh crop of good old days was covered elsewhere on the album. He'd been using—amending, exaggerating, reorganizing, inventing—details from his own life in his songs all along, but on _If I Could Only Fly_ , Haggard at last began to become the almost consistently autobiographical songwriter people had been pegging him for all along. On "Thanks to Uncle John," he paid respect to an old family friend who taught him how to play a "G" chord and helped him after his dad died: "Now John Burke was really not my uncle, but we were kin, 'cause he shared his home and family and he took me in." Another original, "I'm Still Your Daddy," begins brooding and hard: "I knew someday you'd find out about San Quentin . . . ," Merle says, in a voice sounding a little like the Man in Black's. But when he finishes the thought, singing ". . . And your heart would break and your faith would go away," his voice becomes instantly high and fluttery, a scared little boy's. He's singing to his two young children, Ben and Jenessa, telling them he's ashamed of what he did back then and hoping they will love him anyway.

The rest of the album mixed the playfully sweet and the sexually playful to extremes unprecedented in his catalogue. "Crazy Moon," a comely, timeless-sounding ballad of fanciful heartache, abuts "Bareback," a galloping western-swinger that begrudgingly advocates safe sex ("Ain't no taking chances like before!"), though from its locked-in groove, it seems to be adjusting just fine, which is followed by a whimsical children's song, "Think about a Lullaby," with dreamy concluding harp glissando. Haggard pictured himself throughout the album as nestled within a family life he adores. But it was still something of a shock when, just a few cuts on, this inveterate escape artist wished for once that he could just stay put. His two hands remained fit to use, though, and "If I don't travel, I don't make a dime!"

In the first decade of the new century, Haggard was putting out new music almost as rapidly as he had in his most productive years for Capitol. He followed 2000's _If I Could Only Fly_ on Anti-with _Roots, Volume 1_ , in 2001. That album found him once again honoring old influences like Hank Thompson, Hank Williams, and of course, ol' Lefty, even enlisting Norm Stephens, a vintage Frizzell sideman, to play guitar on the album and tour with him for a time. ("This man played _on the record_ ," he liked to gush in concerts while Stephens soloed during "If You've Got the Money.") The album's highlight came on a blasphemous original: A grinning Merle declares not only that he loves his wife "More Than My Old Guitar," but more than "God loves the poor." That's a lot.

Haggard's twenty-first-century revival actually began in the final years of the twentieth. Though not released on Audium until 2002, _The Peer Sessions_ —a collection of old pop and country standards drawn from the Ralph Peer publishing catalogue, cut in intimate small-combo settings—was actually recorded between 1996 and '98 when he was ostensibly working for Curb. Merle's uptown pop rendition of Jimmie Rodgers's "Miss the Mississippi and You" is just lovely, his "Shackles and Chains" pure lonesome. Then, in 1999, no longer Curbed, he rushed out _For the Record: 43 Legendary Hits_ , note-for-mostly-note versions of his biggest hits.

He was just getting started. In 2001 came _Cabin in the Hills_ , an excellent country gospel set that included a cover of Iris De-Ment's "Shores of Jordan," harmonies by Bonnie Owens, and a solemn-to-sanctified "This World Is Not My Home," by Albert Brumley Jr. That last led to _Two Old Friends_ , an entire album with the country gospel legend, released at the same time and which for stripped-down spiritual perfection is the equal of Merle's earlier _Songs for the Mama That Tried_.

In 2003, Merle released an album that claimed he was _Haggard Like Never Before_ , then proved it with a not-quite-coy seduction called "Because of Your Eyes" ("When I look at you, I double in size") and with the title track's earnest counting of the ways that "living on the road today don't have the same appeal." He proved he was a new man that year again when he came out in support of the vilified Dixie Chicks after they'd run down their country, seemingly, by griping about President George W. Bush during the buildup to the Iraq War.

He released two more albums the following year: _Chicago Wind_ featured a cranky Iraq War–era rant, "Where's All the Freedom," and a new, bluesier-than-before version of "White Man Singing the Blues." _Unforgettable_ , meanwhile, a one-off return to Capitol, made good on the hints of Tin Pan Alley he'd been trailing behind him for decades: The album swayed to jazzy fiddle, guitar, and piano and favored pop songwriters ranging from Ira Gershwin ("I Can't Get Started") and Hoagy Carmichael ("Stardust") to Cindy Walker ("Goin' Away Party"). Merle's reading of "Cry Me a River" was announced with a mixture of longing, heartache, and "fuck you" that was uncomfortable to hear—"Nooooo-oow you say you're lonely"—and irresistible.

He wasn't done yet. Over the next couple of years, Haggard released three more themed albums or collaborations: a second duet album with George Jones, _Kickin' Out the Footlights . . . Again: Jones Sings Haggard, Haggard Sings Jones_ ; the majestic _Last of the Breed_ with Willie Nelson and country crooner nonpareil Ray Price; and the self-explanatory _The Bluegrass Sessions_. Throw in his third career holiday album, _I Wish I Was Santa Claus_ in 2004, and a pair of _Live at Billy Bob's_ sets from 1999 and '04, respectively, and Haggard released fifteen albums in the time it had taken him to release three on Curb. Clearly he had it in mind to make up for lost time while he still had the time to do it. "These two old friends enter the studio 25 years after their first album together . . . ," read the album notes to _Kickin' Out the Footlights . . . Again_ , "to pay tribute to each other one last time . . ." That "one last time" recognized one last limit: So much life but only so much living.

Haggard slowed down considerably after that, though only by comparison. In early 2008, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and by the end of that year had had a hunk of a lung removed. But he was soon back to performing a hundred-plus shows a year. His voice was airier after that, his range newly circumscribed, more haggard—his old man voice from "Yesterday" was now his voice for real. But it was still vibrant and mostly intact, and he was still recording. _I Am What I Am_ , featuring masterful minor key originals like "Bad Actor" and a scary gospel song called "How Did You Find Me Here," appeared in 2010, followed in 2011 by _Working in Tennessee_ and rousing covers of two Johnny Cash–associated songs, "Cocaine Blues" and, with wife Theresa Lane, "Jackson."

Haggard had once more been writing political songs through this stretch. The best-known were both from _Chicago Wind_. "That's the News" criticized media coverage of the Iraq War, and "America First" insisted we "get out of Iraq" and start rebuilding our highways and bridges, a subject this road warrior, who just then was coheadlining in theater shows around the country with Bob Dylan, knew something about: "I make twenty trips a year from coast to coast." Also, as early as 2007, he briefly included a song in his sets that urged Hillary Clinton to run for president. That surprised a lot of people, but without radio play, and after three decades of desensitizing Culture War, none of these songs were going to have the impact of "Okie from Muskogee" and "Fightin' Side of Me" even if they'd been as good. They weren't. They weren't in sync with the day's dominant country mindset, either. Country radio increasingly favored the identity politics he'd introduced to the music back in his glory days but had been alternately rejecting or revising via nuance or rejecting outright since. The way he was will continue to be a big part of Haggard's legacy: Toby Keith's "Angry American" is the "Fightin' Side" of the post-9/11 era, and major hits like Montgomery Gentry's "My Town," Rodney Atkins's "These Are My People," Alan Jackson's "Where I Come From," Gretchen Wilson's "Redneck Woman," Blake Shelton's "Hillbilly Bone," and Randy Houser's "How Country Feels" (among many, many others) are all still declaring "I'm Proud to Be an Okie from Muskogee." In the twenty-first century, country radio has at times sounded like an entire format determined to "Pledge Allegiance to the Hag," as Erich Church phrased it in a 2006 track featuring a guest vocal from the Hag himself.

What I suspect will continue to draw future listeners to Haggard's twenty-first-century work will be his singing—you can hear him having fun on these late-in-life records, acting the fool, playing, in ways he'd previously only allowed himself around Christmastime—and the smart cover songs he's been recording more often than ever. Many of those saw him returning to musicians he'd been loving and living with all his life—Frizzell and Rodgers, first on the list as ever—but there have been surprises too. On a 2003 various artists tribute to classic duo the Louvin Brothers, he joined Carl Jackson on a version of "Must You Throw Dirt in My Face" that was queasy with shame. He's filled in a glaring blank on his résumé, too: On 2003's _Haggard Like Never Before_ , he finally covered a Woody Guthrie song, duetting with Willie Nelson on "Reno Blues (Philadelphia Lawyer)." He did Woody again in 2009, singing "Jesus Christ" over the closing credits to the Michael Moore film _Capitalism: A Love Story_. "When the patience of the workers gives away, would be better for the rich if they'd never been born," Merle snarled with real conviction, envisioning a future when that class of people who'd put him and his fellow Okies somewhere just below would themselves be put somewhere below, and not _just_ either.

Two tracks stand out for me among Haggard's twenty-first-century victory lap, not necessarily because they're his best from these years, though if someone said they were I wouldn't argue the point. I hear them as getting down to what's been at the heart of the Hag all along.

The first is a new version of Merle's onetime signature anthem, "Workin' Man Blues," from 2011's _Working in Tennessee_ , which features two special guests, old friend Willie Nelson and Merle's nineteen-year-old son Ben Haggard. "I've been a working man, damn near all my life," Merle declares, coming up on his seventy-fifth birthday. "I might get a little _high_ on the weekend," Willie says, updating the old line, and Merle, very much out of character, offers approval at the top his lungs: "Weeeee-eeell! Hey! Hey!" Then Ben, in a high Cali tenor, gets to sing a verse with his elders. Outsings them actually. I like that.

This new recording of the song keeps suggesting the old one straight along, but this "Workin' Man Blues" isn't riding a rocking Elvis Presley rhythm any longer. But the new groove still rocks—it's slower but just as steady, and it swings more. I like that, too, the way the record is new and old at once, the way sameness butts up against difference, and how each has something helpful to say to one another across the gap of generations. It's one more reminder that even a backward cast of mind as finely honed as Merle Haggard's is always bound to look ahead.

"Don't look back," Satchel Paige famously cautioned. "Something might be gaining on you." Over a career that's now passed the half-century mark, Merle Haggard has offered very different advice. Look back, his music instructs. Look back often. Because life is precious and because memories savored add context, intensity, and flavor to the present. Because looking back is our best measuring stick for the inevitable gains and losses of life and because it's the _only_ tool we have for judging how far we've come and how far we have to go. Oh, and look back for another reason too: _Because something might be gaining on you_.

The other latter-day cut I want to mention is the title track to 2001's _If I Could Only Fly_. A Blaze Foley song, "If I Could Only Fly" goes down with Liz Anderson's "The Fugitive," Dallas Frazier's "California Cottonfields" and "Too Many Bridges to Cross Over," and Sonny Throckmorton's "The Way I Am," not to mention about a dozen Merle Haggard compositions, as essential statements of the Haggard aesthetic. Merle had been singing the song in concert for years, ever since he'd first recorded it with Willie Nelson back in 1987. But where that recording was wistful and almost sweet, his twenty-first-century reading of the song is stark and harrowing, and its sweetness a little bitter like life's. "I almost felt you touching me just now . . . ," is how Merle begins, but there's no one to touch. "I feel so good," he sings, quite carefully, "and then I feel so bad. I wonder what I ought to do." Merle's voice has an eye to the sky, threatens to take wing, but Foley's melody keeps turning flat and halting, and there Merle is, grounded again, and alone. The music's so minimal, just the chords really, that it almost feels like even his old friends the Strangers aren't with him. "If I could only fly," Merle imagines. He would soar to his lover then and there would be no more lonely nights. But in the song he can barely stand up.

Right there's the Hag character in all its poignancy. He can't fly but he can't stop dreaming about how amazing, how freeing, it would be if he could. "If I could only fly . . . ," he sings, his baritone cracking, tumbling backward, then lifting. "If _I_ could only fly . . . if _we_ could only fly . . . if _you_ could only fly . . ." Then we wouldn't need to run anymore.

**Cuba, Missouri**

July 15, 2010

In late December 2010, Merle Haggard became a Kennedy Center Honoree. He'd hobnobbed with presidents before, of course, and when this particular president, Barack Obama, was about to be inaugurated two years earlier, Merle had written a poem, "Hopes Are High," and posted it on his website: "We've got bad times behind us and the good times up ahead/Bet your money on the promise land . . ." But Merle Haggard as a Kennedy Center Honoree was something else again. Here was that old Oildale Okie, San Quentin's own, being feted by the president and first lady, recognized as a Great American Artist and seated between Broadway composer Jerry "Hello, Dolly" Herman and jillionaire talk show host Oprah Winfrey—a seating chart that read on television like a middle-class seal of approval.

For Hag watchers, it was a moving sight—the seventy-three-year-old Merle looked grizzled but fine, a gold medal hung about his neck by rainbow ribbon and wearing a silver-and-grey beard of a decidedly Lincolnesque cut. He got teary and sang along quietly to himself when "Silver Wings" was performed in his honor. A Kris Kristofferson–narrated biography film was smartly done—it got to "Okie from Muskogee" soon enough but kicked off with "Footlights," a Merle favorite—and the inevitable Willie Nelson–led all-star jam skipped "Workin' Man Blues" in favor of "Ramblin' Fever." When it was over, Haggard stood, removed his black hat, and nodded thank you.

A few months earlier, Merle had been in a more familiar setting when he played the Crawford County Fair in Cuba, Missouri, along Historic Route 66, Ghost Road of the Okies. A lot of the old folks who'd never left these hills in the first place got to the show early to set up their lawn chairs in the good spots, under tall shade trees that lined the grass-and-dirt concert area. Middle-aged men nursed their beers, younger parents shooed away kids playing grab-ass across their picnic blankets, and everyone fought the July heat as best they could with complimentary "It's Cool to Be a Republican" cardboard fans. Every five minutes or so, a prerecorded message suggested we visit the Hag Store for CDs, autographed photos, and "cropped-top baby-tees."

Noel Haggard, Merle's boy from his first marriage, wandered out and played a few songs. Then came the Mathis Brothers, a North Carolina duo signed to Hag Records, who sang classics like "Walkin' the Floor over You" and "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" ("We're all about keeping traditional country music alive!"), and then Merle came out. He was dressed in black, from boots to Stetson, and he moved very slowly.

It took him a few numbers to get his voice going. Merle in his later years isn't afraid to deploy the spoken phrase when he needs it to catch his breath, but he does so sparingly, artfully, and he also plays a lot more electric guitar—it's become like a second voice. He launched "I Think I'll Stay Here and Drink" with jagged power chords, and when he took a solo, his notes were delicate and jazzy, then turned suddenly violent, almost pure noise.

Once his voice was warmed up, he sang ballads—"Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star," "Today I Started Loving You Again." On "If We Make It through December," a big guy to my right, silent and still for the last half hour, heard Merle croon "Got laid off down at the factory," pumped his fist in the air, and shouted "God DAMN it!"

People cheered, hard, for "Workin' Man Blues," though when Merle boasted about never being on welfare, normally a certain-applause line of the "Hell, yeah!" variety, it passed by in this county (45 percent of the locals are on food stamps) without so much as a clap. "I'm tired of this dirty old city," however, earned a half dozen enthusiastic whoops in the Missouri Ozarks.

Across the way, another man kept hounding Merle to play "Mama Tried." "Maaaaaa-maaaaaa," he bellowed between songs, each time louder and longer than before. "I'll play it," Merle finally snapped, "but I ain't gonna play it _now_." Then he thought about it: "Well, now wait a minute. . . . Would it _fit_ now? Yeah, I think it would. All right, this one goes out to this ol' loud fella over here." The crowd roared, a thousand people singing together—"Mama tried. Mama Tried. MAMA TRIED"—and very nearly a thousand people missing that final highest note, Merle included, and it was beautiful.

A young woman behind me, late twenties, said to no one in particular: "It's like every song he sings is the most amazing song ever. _Every song_."

Merle played "Fightin' Side of Me," dedicating it to the soldiers fighting overseas, solemnizing the moment and quelling the U.S.A. chant that had arisen instantly at his mentioning of the song's title. He played "Okie from Muskogee," introducing it as "A song I wrote for my father. He was from Oklahoma and he did not smoke marijuana. He. Did. Not." The applause seemed like it would never stop after that, and Haggard stood stock still, smiling broadly, and let it come. Then he was gone.

After a while I headed over to where his Silver Eagle was parked by the side of the stage to check out the autograph line. Merle was already onboard, though, the bus just beginning to lumber its way across the fairgrounds. It took a left onto the main road, old Route 66, and I watched until the taillights disappeared in the distance, Merle Haggard heading toward Oklahoma and points west, looking for home.
**Selected Discography**

Merle Haggard has released more than eighty albums over nearly half a century, and that's not counting a quartet of mostly instrumental albums by the Strangers or greatest hits and other anthology releases, both pricey and cheapo, that at this rate will sooner than later outpace official releases. It can be daunting even figuring out where to start. Never fear: Suggestions are here!

I'd say the best place to begin exploring the Haggard catalogue—the way to get the most essential Haggard music all in one place—remains _Down Every Road: 1962–1994_ (Capitol, 1996). That four-disc set encompasses a body of work as foundational to modern country music (as well as to all varieties of country rock) as the sides on James Brown's _Star Time_ set have been to R&B, soul, and hip-hop. For a less pricey first step, however, go with _The Complete Capitol '60s Singles_ (Omnivore, 2013), which collects on a single disc all of Haggard's 45s (B-sides included) from the first half decade of his career when he was establishing the sound and persona he has in one way or another pursued ever since. Here's hoping a companion disc, gathering his '70s Capitol singles, is on the way.

Something along those same lines needs doing for Merle's short half decade at MCA Records, as well: The only available overview at present is the twenty-four-track _From the King to the Barrooms_ (Indie Europe/Zoom, 2008), which misses key recordings, including some of the hits, while inexplicably going six songs deep into Merle's disappointing Elvis tribute. Efficient single-disc options are even scarcer for anyone looking to understand Haggard's decade at Epic Records. The least bad choice, _The Essential Merle Haggard: The Epic Years_ , clocks in at a miserly fourteen tracks—not including "Kern River" and "Natural High," which is to say the disc doesn't even meet the limited criteria of its title. As for the time Merle served at Curb in the 1990s, no current anthology covers this period of his career nor is one desired.

What serious Haggard fans will want to do, eventually, is venture beyond anthologies to the man's individual albums. Of those four score albums, almost all are worth your time in one way or another. Even culling from the herd only the very best of his albums would still have us choosing from among dozens. For recommendations nearer to complete, see _Merle Haggard: The Running Kind_ itself, but what follows is this selected discography's attempt to be extremely selective: A list of only a dozen Merle Haggard albums, taking in the masterpieces (well, the bulk of them anyway), but also attempting to capture the scope of his sounds, styles, themes, and interests.

Merle Haggard and the Strangers,

_Mama Tried_ (Capitol, 1968)

A theme album about prison as both place and state of mind. Its bookends are key: The regretful-but-defiant "Mama Tried" and Dallas Frazier's "Too Many Bridges to Cross Over." "Like an eagle, I'm a prisoner of the wind . . ." His first masterpiece.

Merle Haggard and the Strangers,

_Pride in What I Am_ (Capitol, 1969)

From the boastful humility of the title track to the beautiful strangeness of "The Day the Rains Came" to the hounded "I Can't Hold Myself in Line" to the kiss-my-ass celebration of "I'm Bringing Home Good News," this brooding, low-key, and mostly acoustic album gets my nomination for greatest country-rock album ever.

Merle Haggard,

_Same Train, a Different Time_ (Capitol, 1969)

The country music tradition's finest tribute album is, not at all coincidentally, an exemplar of how the country tradition works: Yesterday's songs done up so they sound like today.

Merle Haggard and the Strangers,

_Hag_ (Capitol, 1970)

The most consistently political album of Hag's career and, bonus, one of his best, thanks especially to "Shelley's Winter Love," "Jesus, Take a Hold," "I Can't Be Myself," "I'm a Good Loser," and "The Farmer's Daughter."

Merle Haggard and the Strangers,

_Someday We'll Look Back_ (Capitol, 1971)

Read 'em and weep: "Someday We'll Look Back," "Train of Life," "One Sweet Hello," "One Row at a Time," "Big Time Annie's Square," "I'd Rather Be Gone," "California Cottonfields," "Carolyn," "Tulare Dust," "Huntsville," and "The Only Trouble with Me." If this isn't Merle Haggard's best album . . .

Merle Haggard,

_Serving 190 Proof_ (MCA, 1979)

Then this one is. A low and lonesome testament to rugged individualism ("My Own Kind of Hat") running smack into a wall ("Red Bandana") and the disillusionment and depression ("Footlights," "I Can't Get Away") that follow. Self-medication included ("Heaven Was a Drink of Wine"), along with hard-won wisdom ("Roses in Winter").

Merle Haggard,

_Songs for the Mama That Tried_ (MCA, 1981)

The most reverent and soulful, the sparest and most beautiful, of his four gospel sets. "Swing Low Sweet Chariot" finds Merle's baritone hitching a ride with a choir all the way to glory.

Merle Haggard,

_Big City_ (Epic, 1981)

The definitive statement of backward-glancing Reagan-era country, thanks to the title track, "I Wish a Buck Was Still Silver," and a swell cover of "Stop the World and Let Me Off."

Merle Haggard and George Jones,

_A Taste of Yesterday's Wine_ (Epic, 1982)

In which Merle Haggard joins Tammy Wynette as the only human being to ever outsing George Jones. Also, humor doesn't get any darker than "Must've Been Drunk" or "I Think I've Found a Way."

Merle Haggard and Leona Williams,

_Heart to Heart_ (Mercury, 1983)

Probably the most underrated album in Merle's catalogue. Leona is at her best here. Roy Nichols is very near to his, as well.

Merle Haggard,

_The Epic Collection (Recorded Live)_ (Epic, 1983)

_Okie from Muskogee_ was a more culturally significant concert album, and _I Love Dixie Blues_ a more historically minded one, but for capturing Merle's emotive and musical range as a singer, as well as showcasing the improvisational skills of his Strangers, this is the live album to get.

Merle Haggard,

_If I Could Only Fly_ (Anti-, 2000)

The first and still the best of his twenty-first-century releases. The alternately harrowing and heart-swelling personal ballads ("Wishing All These Old Things Were New," "I'm Still Your Daddy") will grab you first. But it's the loosest, hottest western swing of his life ("Bareback," "Honky Tonk Mama") that will keep you coming back.
**Acknowledgments**

Of course, I must first thank Merle Haggard. Listening again, and so intensely, to his body of work was fun, challenging, and inspiring—and not a little humbling.

Those who influenced my thinking about Haggard, class, and country music are many. In varying ways—I know some of them personally, even well, but others only through their work—they together formed a kind of critical chorus of voices in my head: Dave A. Cantwell, Cheryl Cline, Julie Criner, Chuck Eddy, Howard Eisberg, John Floyd, Bill Friskics-Warren, the late Paul Hemphill, Charles Hughes, Mike Ireland, C. J. Janovy, Roy Kasten, Bill C. Malone, Greil Marcus, Dave Marsh, Barry Mazor, John Morthland, Diane Pecknold, the late Richard Peterson, Tex Sample, Ed Scanlon, Alan Scherstuhl, Mike Warren, Jon Weisberger, Carl Wilson, Gary Wilson, and Don Yates.

Several others not only influenced my work but helped me directly. Craig Werner and Danny Alexander read behind me and provided invaluable feedback and support. I owe a great debt to Deke Dickerson and to all the other liner notes writers and sessionographers of Bear Family Records' several Merle Haggard box sets. I must thank Casey Kittrell, Victoria Davis, Lindsay Starr, Leslie Tingle, and Allison Faust at the University of Texas Press for their commitment and their patience, and Paul Spragens, copyeditor extraordinaire. Peter Blackstock approached me about contributing a volume to the American Music Series, for which I am beyond grateful. Many others—including the late Liz Anderson, Cary Baker, Don Cusic, Todd Everett, Chet Flippo, Dallas Frazier, Michael Grey, Peter La Chapelle, Michael McCall, Patrick Milligan, Bryan Murray, Bill Osment, Robert Price, and several of the good folks at Johnson County Community College's Billington Library—were generous with their time and expertise when I had questions or otherwise needed assistance.

Finally, thank you to Doris Saltkill for her bottomless support, practical and emotional and otherwise: Every word I write is for you. Someday, as Merle Haggard sings, we'll look back and say, "This was fun."
