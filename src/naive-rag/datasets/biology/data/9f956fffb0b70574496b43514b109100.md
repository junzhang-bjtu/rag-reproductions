**Introduction: Turtles as Hopeful Monsters**

I

HERE THEY ARE, STILL WITH US, BOXED UP IN A SHELL, SEEMING survivors of the distant geologic past: prehistoric creatures that both predated and outlived the dinosaurs. As a symbol in Hindu and Chinese mythology, the turtle supports the earth—but what supports the turtle? The philosophically intriguing answer is this: it's turtles all the way down. Sluggish on land, seemingly stubborn in their behavior, turtles came to symbolize longevity, strength, and endurance in ancient China. The longevity of the turtle lineage is indeed remarkable, as is its evolutionary strength if measured by the numbers of species that have populated Earth for at least 220 million years, which is the approximate age of the oldest fossil turtle currently known. (For a discussion of fossils some 260 million years old, controversially interpreted as the oldest stem-turtle, see chap. 3.) In spite of their highly constrained body plan, turtles show a surprising potential for evolutionary diversification, with species that conquered a great variety of habitats: forests and grasslands, deserts and karst mountains, rivers, ponds, lakes, even the open sea, with some 331 living species currently recognized (Fritz and Havas, 2007; van Dijk et al., 2012).

As Adler has remarked, "Turtles are one of nature's most immediately recognizable life forms" (2007:139), bizarre in their own way, which is what seems to attract people's attention as well as scientists' curiosity. Where do turtles come from, and how did their unique anatomy and bodily functions evolve? These are questions that have spurred intense research as well as heated debate for 200 years and more. Yet even in the wake of the development of revolutionizing techniques in modern molecular biology, the answer remains as elusive as ever. Progress has been made, but a lot still remains to be discovered.

The eminent twentieth-century evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky once noted, "Nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution" (1973:125). Philosophers of biology Kim Sterelny and Paul E. Griffiths paraphrased this famous line as, "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the context of its place in phylogeny, its context in the great tree of life" (1999:379). To ask where turtles come from is to raise the question of turtle ancestry. It certainly is uncontroversial that turtles are reptiles, but that does not tell us what group of reptiles gave rise to the turtle lineage in the distant part. What was the ancestor of turtles? That question was certainly a legitimate one to ask in the middle of the twentieth century and earlier, when the study of fossils was largely motivated by the search for ancestors of still-living descendants. The study of fossils retrieved from successive layers of rock was at that time compared to leafing through an illustrated book on evolution, supposedly revealing a gallery of ancestors and descendants.

Paleontologists started to research the ancestry of turtles well back in the nineteenth century, but until recently, all the fossil turtles pulled from sedimentary rock spanning vast geologic time were already finished exemplars, complete with carapace and plastron. It's indeed turtles all the way down! In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the study of evolutionary relationships was revolutionized; comparative biology went through a cladistic revolution. The search for ancestors was rejected as dilettante science; instead, the search for sister groups became all the rage. When, through evolutionary time, a species lineage splits into two, the stem species gives rise to two daughter species. These two daughter species are sister species; their respective descendants thus form sister groups. Rather than asking what was the ancestor of turtles, the question—in the aftermath of the cladistic revolution—must be, what kind of a reptile species was it that shared with the turtle lineage a common ancestor that was not also ancestral to any other reptile lineage? In other words, which lineage of reptiles is more closely related to turtles than either is to any other reptile group? To answer this question requires some foundational knowledge about the basic structure of the reptile skull and the various modifications it underwent as reptiles diversified into turtles, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. This is because the skull, as well as other parts of the skeleton, may hold the key to understanding turtle origins. More recently, molecular data, in particular DNA data, have in large measure been adduced in the search for turtle origins. But in spite of all these efforts, the deep evolutionary history of the turtle lineage remains only dimly lit.

Some paleontologists may still maintain that turtles are living fossils, descendants of ancient stem-reptiles that have long vanished from the surface of the earth. Other authors, working mostly with skeletal features, have argued that turtles are more closely related to the tuatara and the scaly reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, than they are related to any other reptile group, including crocodiles and birds. Researchers working with DNA data, in contrast, have found that turtles are more closely related to crocodiles and birds than they are related to any other reptile group, including the tuatara and the scaly reptiles. Although discussion and debate continue, the current situation looks like one where the experts have agreed to disagree. Beyond hard yet still inconclusive evidence, rhetoric is also at work in science. Science is not just about observation and measurement; it is also about how scientists talk about their observations and measurements. The controversial case of turtle relationships provides prime examples of how the language used by a group of scientists can guide scientific inquiry in a particular direction to the exclusion of alternative perspectives. Science, at least the kind that seeks to decipher evolutionary relationships, does not happen in the germ-free environment of a clean lab, pursued by a cold, detached, and unbiased intellect. It is instead an eminently social enterprise, collaborative and competitive at the same time.

Better knowledge of turtle sister group relationships would certainly help to understand how the extravagant turtle body plan evolved. How did the turtle shell, its associated structures, and the consequent physiological peculiarities of turtles evolve? Everybody would certainly agree that a finished turtle, complete with carapace and plastron, differs radically in its anatomy from all other reptiles, such as crocodiles or lizards. But how are such radical evolutionary transformations possible? Darwin argued that evolution is a slow, gradual, stepwise process of transformation, fueled by random variation and constrained by natural selection. No biologist would question the reality of such Darwinian evolution, a process that plays out at the level of populations of interbreeding organisms that represent a species—perhaps a species that is about to split, slowly and gradually, into two daughter species. What some evolutionary biologists doubted in the past, however, and continue to doubt today, is that such Darwinian evolutionary processes are sufficient to explain radical evolutionary change as is evident in the turtle body plan.

There thus must exist additional mechanisms of evolutionary transformation—mechanisms that cut deeper than Darwinian variation and natural selection. The historical and contemporary research into these mechanisms could collectively be subsumed under an umbrella theory of "hopeful monsters," a term introduced by Richard Goldschmidt. Past—and now obsolete—theories of orthogenetic evolution stipulated a goal directedness and cyclicality of evolutionary processes. Every major evolutionary lineage, each representing a distinct body plan, would lawfully have cycled through a phase of youthfulness, adulthood, senescence, and death (extinction). The birth (origin) of a new major evolutionary lineage would have occurred through a disruption and reorganization of early embryonic development in representatives of the youthful phase of the ancestral evolutionary lineage. The evolutionary development of a major evolutionary lineage would thus have run parallel to the individual development of an organism. Modern theories of evolutionary developmental biology stipulate that it is the rewiring of the developmental program guiding early embryonic development that lays the foundation for the emergence of evolutionary novelties, for which the turtle shell is a prime example. The embryonic development of the turtle shell, together with recently found fossils of the oldest turtle currently known, conclusively refute the theory advanced by Jan Versluys in 1914 of a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor that treats the carapace not as an evolutionary novelty but as the product of a gradual and stepwise transformation of ancestral bony structures. Although the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor was an entirely theoretical construct, it was nevertheless infused with a touch of reality, although not through paleontological discovery but rather through consensus building among scientists—a construction rather than a tangible fossil.

The journey we are about to embark on starts with an entry-level account of early stages of investigations into the reptile tree of life. A number of authorities on reptile evolution are introduced from an insider's perspective of science, as are the protagonists of the cladistic revolution and the goals of the battle they fought. The historical quest for the turtle ancestor will be sketched, followed by an account of modern, i.e., cladistic, approaches to the investigation of turtle relationships. In order to address the question of the origin and evolution of the turtle shell, it is first necessary to contrast the Darwinian account of species origination and transformation with various theories of hopeful monsters, both old and new. Tensions will become apparent between the burgeoning science of genetics and the equally youthful sciences of paleobiology and population biology—tensions that reflected the social politics of the times leading up to World War II. The years after the war saw a progressive hardening of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, which reduced all evolutionary change to population-level processes driven by the Darwinian twin mechanisms of variation and natural selection. However, some critics remained unconvinced of this monolithic account of evolution and raised their voices in the late 1970s and 1980s in the first blossoming of a research program that would later be dubbed evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo. The old idea of the hopeful monster once again began to guide research into the mechanisms of major evolutionary transitions. This perspective opens the door to a discussion of the origin and evolution of the turtle shell, a prime example of an evolutionary novelty that will be illuminated through an account of its embryonic development. It has long been claimed that embryonic development can teach us something about evolutionary transformations. What's even more exciting is the claim, issued by a selected few, that embryonic development could even allow prediction of the kinds of fossils that still remain to be discovered. But such discoveries are not easy to come by.

For the remains of an organism to become fossilized is a rare chance event. For a fossil to be found is an even chancier event—unless there prevailed in the past regional conditions highly favorable to the fossilization of carcasses, as was the case some 252 to 220 million years ago at the bottom of the sea that covered what today is southwestern China. Add to this an army of fossil hunters leaving no stone unturned or unsplit, and your chances of finding important fossils greatly increase. Since the late 1990s, the rural population of southwestern China has engaged in a veritable gold rush, with their gold being cashed out in the form of Triassic marine reptiles. Unauthorized—and often dangerous—excavation activity, the forgery of fossils, and illegal fossil trade all hint at an unbridled capitalist spirit. In the midst of all this frenzy, science has reaped huge profits as well, albeit of an intellectual nature. The idea that embryonic development might help predict what kind of transitional fossil might be expected was spectacularly born out by the discovery of fossils of the oldest turtle currently known, which come from marine Triassic deposits in southwestern China. (Older fossils have recently, and controversially, been placed on the turtle stem, as discussed in chap. 3.) Truly a turtle in the making—a turtle on the half shell!

Herr Professor

OFF WE WERE ON A PLANE TO LONDON, OUR SPIRITS RISING HIGH in anticipation. It must have been the fall of 1972. I was an undergraduate student in zoology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, my companion a graduate student in zoology at the University of Zurich. We had both dedicated ourselves to the study of amphibians and reptiles, a branch of zoological science called herpetology. Othmar Stemmler, son of local celebrity Carl Stemmler, informally tutored us both (Honegger and Obst, 2014). Othmar's father was a keeper at the Basel Zoological Garden responsible for the great apes, who had acquired some prominence through his popular and engaging books and radio shows about zoo animals and African safaris. Othmar was an elementary school teacher, spending most of his free time working as a volunteer in the herpetological section at the Basel Natural History Museum. Herpetology had had a long and famous history at the museum, which had resulted in a large and historically significant collection of amphibians and reptiles, with numerous rare and important specimens from all over the world. However, herpetological research at the Basel museum, once of international reputation, tapered off and came to a halt toward the mid-twentieth century, the collections left orphaned. Heini Hediger, a renowned pioneer in the field of animal psychology and director of the Basel zoo from 1944 through 1953, was the last scientist of international reputation who, again as a volunteer, had worked in the herpetological collections of the Basel museum before Othmar's time (Honegger, 2015).

Although he was self-trained, Othmar Stemmler was in the early 1970s one of only two or three experts in Switzerland who specialized in the study of species-level taxonomy of amphibians and reptiles. He took me under his tutelage at the Basel Natural History Museum while I was still a high school student in the late 1960s and introduced me to the art and science of species-level taxonomy. Ernst Mayr's (1904–2005) then brand-new textbook, _Principles of Systematic Zoology_ (1969), was never far from reach. Mayr, originally of German extraction, was the undisputed preeminent evolutionary biologist of the day, professor at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, and author of the then-current standard text on evolutionary theory, his 1963 _Animal Species and Evolution_. Mayr's systematics was heavily based on his own field studies of population biology and patterns of speciation, i.e., modes of species origination in birds, especially those of New Guinea. After graduating from the University of Berlin, Mayr accepted appointment as a curator at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York in 1931—an employment that offered a most welcome escape from the troubled economy and politics of the Weimar Republic. He vacated his New York position in 1953 when he moved to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. After the collapse of the Third Reich in his home country, Mayr was instrumental in organizing, with the help of the American Ornithologists' Union, the mailing of CARE packages to needy German ornithologists, drawing on his old contacts to make sure that no Nazi fellow travelers would profit from these efforts (Rieppel, 2013a).

At the Basel museum, with Mayr's book at hand, Othmar and I measured size, recorded colors, and counted scales until we had convinced ourselves that some local population of lizards or snakes in some corner of this world was sufficiently distinct from its neighbors so as to be recognized as a new species, or subspecies. Together with like-minded reptile aficionados, all of them older and more experienced than me, Othmar loved to put together collecting expeditions that ventured out to places around the Mediterranean, though with a preference for the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Back at the museum, the collected animals had to be properly pickled, identified, tagged, and cataloged, tasks I went about in the customary white lab coat but without latex gloves (the carcinogenic properties of formalin had not yet been recognized). Some gecko lizards of the genus _Tarentola_ brought back from localities ranging along the northern margins of the Sahara desert seemed to not quite fit any of the diagnoses of the species then known and formally recognized in the genus. But the number of specimens at our disposal was too small to build a solid taxonomic case for the description of a new species. So off we went to London, my fellow student from Zurich and I, where we had arranged for an appointment in the section of amphibians and reptiles at what was then called the British Museum of Natural History in South Kensington.

The friendly and helpful staff at the museum put all we needed at our disposal: specimens, work space, calipers, and microscopes. But we did not seize this great opportunity after all. Instead, we enjoyed Carnaby Street and King's Road, bookstores and record stores, curries and fish and chips for dinner, and of course Guinness at the pub. London was still affordable at the time. The new species, if it was one, remained undescribed. Perhaps scale counting and calculating limb proportions was not my thing after all. Indeed, as unlikely as this may sound, while sitting in the plane to London, I was studying a classic textbook on the anatomy and embryonic development of vertebrates—that is, animals with a backbone—published by Goodrich in 1930. Edwin S. Goodrich (1868–1946) was an eminent zoologist at Oxford University, specializing in comparative anatomy, embryology, paleontology (the study of fossils), and phylogeny, i.e., the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships based on the insights generated by the aforementioned disciplines. Pages sporting complex drawings of snake skulls with their many teeth and fangs were followed by no less hard-to-understand illustrations of toothless turtle skulls: the massive skull of a sea turtle, the more delicately built skull of a soft-shelled turtle, and the skull of the oldest fossil turtle then known, from the Late Triassic of Germany, adorned with bumps and encrustations some 220 million years old. The text around those illustrations rambled on about the "temporal roofing" that in snakes had "almost entirely disappeared," quite in contrast to turtles, where, at least in the pictured sea turtle and in the fossil one, the cheek region of the skull located behind the eye socket was entirely closed. But this, Goodrich claimed, was not the primitive, ancestral condition for turtles; it was instead "a secondary covering of the temporal region by dermal scutes" (Goodrich, 1930:354). What was I to make of that? With such verbiage still difficult for me to grasp, Goodrich's account and illustrations of embryonic reptile skulls, of blood vessels and nerves snaking their way through a cartilaginous labyrinth, and the significance of all this for the understanding of reptile evolution completely evaded me. I marveled at the illustrations, underlined text I thought I could make sense of, and asked myself if Goodrich's rich, strange, and fascinating world would ever become fully intelligible to me. The intellectual challenge certainly seemed bigger and more attractive than that of counting scales and measuring limbs.

My search for Goodrich's 1930 textbook, _Studies on the Structure and Development of Vertebrates_ , which I found in a famous secondhand bookstore located at the south head of the Mittlere Brücke in Basel, had been motivated by Georg Haas (1905–1981), the Herr Professor, as everybody called him, at the University of Basel (and later the University of Zurich) (Werner, 1965, 1982; Gans, 1983; Adler, 1989:101). He frequented that store whenever he was in town, as did every foreign visitor to the Zoological Institute, the latter located just a few steps from the store up a steep and narrow alley into the historic center of the town clustered around the Basel Minster. Haas, who was born into a Jewish family in Vienna on January 19, 1905, obtained the foundation for a classical, broad-based education at the Humanistisches Gymnasium (classical grammar school) before enrolling at the University of Vienna to study zoology and paleontology under herpetologists Franz Werner (1867–1939) and Otto von Wettstein (1892–1967), and Dutch functional anatomist Jan Versluys (1873–1939), the latter as of 1925 director of the Second Zoological Institute (Salvini-Plawen and Mizzaro, 1999:30). Versulys—a protégé of the politically compromised paleobiologist Othenio Abel (Ehrenberg, 1975:101; Svojtka, 2011:63n56; Taschwer, 2012)—was the principal advisor for his PhD thesis, which he completed in 1928, and which dealt with the functional anatomy of the head skeleton in primitive and poisonous snakes. Explaining the highly complex jaw mechanics of the burrowing blind snakes in the genus _Typhlops_ in the courses he taught later, Haas would provoke incredulous stares from his students when he exclaimed, "Imagine myself being the skull of _Typhlops_ , my arms its upper jaws," all the while moving about his angled arms in no clearly discernible pattern. Indeed, these snakes use their upper jaws in alternating movements that create a unique raking mechanism when feasting on termite and ant eggs and larvae, although they would not spurn adults as prey either.

The Herr Professor also reminisced about taking courses from eccentric paleontologist Franz Baron Nopcsa (1877–1933), of aristocratic Transylvanian extraction, who in the years immediately before the Great War lobbied for an independent kingdom of Albania. He thought that the Habsburg government of Austria-Hungary should install him as king of Albania, which would then allow him to instigate a guerrilla war against the Turks (Elsie, 1999; Weishampel and Kerscher, 2013:404). Haas pictured Nopcsa sitting at his desk, leafing through an enormous folio-sized sketch book featuring illustrations of all kinds of reptile skulls in an attempt to decipher possible evolutionary, i.e., phylogenetic, relationships among them. He also recounted an episode from a seminar on paleobiology offered by Othenio Abel, the founder of said discipline, which aims to reconstruct the biology of extinct plants and animals (Rieppel, 2013b). Could she deduce the direction from which the wind was blowing on the basis of ripple marks manifest on Paleozoic sedimentary rock from Morocco, Abel had asked a baffled student? Nopcsa, who sat in as well, quickly responded in the student's stead: "Could it be that the wind blew once from the West, once from the East, once from the North, and once from the South, just as it does today?"

In the years 1931–1932, Haas was a postdoctoral fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem, where he studied the microscopic structure of unicellular organisms called protozoans under its director, zoologist and natural philosopher Max Hartmann (1876–1962). Dark, or rather brown, clouds were rising ever faster on the horizon, however. News reached him from Vienna of the growing antisemitism at the university, which increasingly turned violent (e.g., Pauley, 1992:192). Othenio Abel, president of the University of Vienna during the academic year 1932–1933, has been implicated in pulling strings behind the scene to stir up antisemitic sentiments and was accused of using his influence to prevent Jews from pursuing an academic career at the university (Taschwer, 2012). Later, effective with the beginning of the academic year 1934–1935, Abel would be sent into early retirement because of his political, indeed National Socialist, activities, which he pursued when he was president of the University of Vienna (Deichmann, 1996:71; see also Rieppel, 2013b). In anticipation of such developments, and advised by faculty from the University of Vienna, Haas decided in 1932 to heed the invitation to join the fledging Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine (Werner, 1982:491). The department of zoology was located in an old, picturesque building on the Russian Compound, with Mount Scopus in sight across the valley.

Haas was an expansive personality—a bachelor gourmet cook, lover of classical music, and avid reader of history. At least in his older age he had trouble enduring the summer heat in the Levant, and he looked for opportunities to teach as a guest lecturer at the University of Basel, where I first met him, and later at the University of Zurich, where I met him again. A course he offered on the origin of mammals set me on the track to study Goodrich's monograph. The platypus: here is a "duckbilled, beaver-tailed, otter-footed" mammal that lays eggs—Wikipedia facts well known to anybody only remotely interested in natural history (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus>, accessed June 21, 2016). What I did not know, and what is also not recounted in Wikipedia, is the fact, pointed out in great detail by Herr Professor, that the pectoral girdle of the platypus more closely resembles that of a reptile than that of a mammal. Herr Professor got so excited in his account of such bony structures and their evolutionary significance that he almost crushed the precious mounted skeleton.

Herr Professor's scientific interests were wide ranging. A major part of his research was spent on the head anatomy of scaly reptiles (squamates), in particular the many forms of burrowing lizards and primitive snakes, hoping to discover an evolutionary link between those. But he was equally at home in systematic and biogeographic studies of the reptile fauna of the Levant, and Israel in particular. Biogeographers study the historical distribution of plant and animal species, as this provides one more key to an understanding of their evolutionary relationships. The Levant is of particular biogeographic interest, as it lies on the intersection between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. And as if this were not enough, exposures of Triassic rocks at Makhtesh Ramon, a large ancient meteor crater in the Negev Desert, allowed Haas and his students to collect marine reptiles some 240 million years old, such as nothosaurs and placodonts (of which more later).

An unexpected but important door opened in the wake of the Six-Day War of 1967. As the Suk in Eastern Jerusalem became accessible to Israelis, Haas rushed to get highly praised Arab tobacco for his pipe. Surprisingly, he found fossils for sale on the doorsteps of a tobacco store. As he inquired about their provenance, he found them to come from 'Ein Yabrud on the West Bank, approximately 20 kilometers north of Jerusalem, where limestone of mid-Cretaceous age was being quarried for building stone and facing. The delicate, fine-grained, and flat-cleaving limestone had to be quarried by hand, which is how the fossils were found in these marine deposits, roughly 95 million years old. Haas befriended the quarry owners, asking them to show him their fossil finds first. He purchased the scientifically important specimens for the National Natural History Collections kept at Hebrew University, and the remainder could go to the tobacco stores in the Suk. This is how Haas built an impressive collection of mid-Cretaceous (Cenomanian) marine reptiles for the Hebrew University—a collection that included lots of turtles, but most prominently simoliophid snakes with well-developed hind limbs, destined to become the objects of a heated debate about snake origins that erupted twenty years after Haas's death.

Over in London, with Goodrich in hand, I took time out from fooling around and set out to find the University College, and within it the department of zoology, where vertebrate paleontology was taught, a subject that had no representative at the University of Basel. Kenneth Kermack (1919–2000) was an expert in the study of the earliest mammals from the uppermost Triassic, fossil remains some 205 million years old, which he studied in collaboration with his wife, Doris, and his assistant, Frances Mussett. He taught a master's course in vertebrate paleontology and offered support for my application to the British Council for a scholarship that would allow me to study in London for one year. I passed my diploma examinations in the spring of 1974 and got ready to leave for London in the late summer with scholarship in hand. Haas again taught at Basel University that summer semester and was thrilled to send me off: "Go to the British Museum (Natural History)," he urged. "They have a fully disarticulated skull of an ichthyosaur [a dolphinlike marine reptile from the Jurassic, some 190 million years old] there, where all the bones have been separated from one another for closer inspection, a specimen well worth of analysis and description. And don't forget to have a good look at the skeletal collection of primitive snakes they have in the section of amphibians and reptiles!" Would I be allowed back, after the fiasco with the gecko lizards just a couple of years ago?

The year in London proved transformative. Kermack, an utterly eccentric personality, took us on a whirlwind tour through vertebrate paleontology, as well as on a memorable field trip to the Devonian Old Red Sandstone on the Orkney Islands. A search for fossil fish some 390 million years old up and down a stretch of the coast was spectacularly unsuccessful—Kermack had misread the geological map. I asked him about the possibility of writing my master's thesis on the disarticulated ichthyosaur skull that Haas had pointed me to, but he was decidedly opposed to the idea of me wandering off to the Natural History Museum in South Kensington. My topic was to be a certain group of lobe-finned fishes called rhipidistians, the probable ancestors of the earliest land-dwelling tetrapods, the amphibians. What made things worse was that my master's thesis was to be a pure literature review, with no real fossils involved. Since the course was pass or fail, I planned to invest just enough time into my thesis to secure a pass, but I secretly went off to the museum all the same, telling people there not to let Kermack know. The helpful and friendly staff in the section for amphibians and reptiles did not blink an eye when I showed up again, allowing me unrestricted access to their collection of skeletons. Garth Underwood (1919–2002), at the time the world's leading expert on snake evolution and classification, patiently introduced me to the intricacies of the osteology of primitive snakes, especially their skull (Stewart, 2003). Together with Angus d'A. Bellairs, Underwood had published a hugely influential review paper on the origin of snakes, which, although dating back to 1951, still set the standard. They concluded that snakes had evolved from some burrowing, lizardlike ancestor, a hypothesis that had also motivated much of Haas's research.

Bellairs (1918–1990) was one of the most distinguished herpetologists of his time, expert in reptile anatomy, embryology, ecology, and behavior as well as author of numerous technical and popular books and papers (Bryant, 1991; Gans, 1991). In his office at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, we argued endlessly about the significance of the primary and secondary lateral head vein for a proper understanding of the reptile braincase wall, and what this could tell us about the evolution of the major lineages of reptiles. I had come a long way from first poking my nose into Goodrich's monograph. When discussions heated up, Angus would pull a fat volume from his bookshelf, the pages of which he had carved out so as to be able to hide a bottle of sherry inside. I was introduced to the annual meetings on Vertebrate Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy that were organized at some British university or alternatively in France, where in the years to come I would meet a host of illustrious representatives of the discipline from all over the world. Beverly Halstead (1933–1991), who off and on changed his name to Tarlo, once climbed on a table to give a daring demonstration of the sex life of dinosaurs—not too different, he thought, from that of agamid lizards he had observed in Africa. He showed up at the meetings with a different female companion each year, whereupon Kermack never failed to ask him in a manner audible to all: "Ah, Bev, you got married again?" Bellairs, an avid collector of antiques, was by his own testimony delighted to find that in most British cities adult stores could be found in the same neighborhood as antique stores; he showed up at the meetings with a broad grin on his face, a telling bag in hand containing his latest acquisitions. The young Michael Benton, a rising star in vertebrate paleontology, in one of his talks on reptile phylogeny, characterized the acclaimed doyen of British dinosaur research, Alan Charig (1927–1997), as pursuing a dilettante approach to science—strong rhetoric, although it was not meant in a hostile sense; rather, it signaled a paradigm shift in evolutionary studies that had been brought about by the cladistic revolution. None of that would have been imaginable in the stiff scientific circles back home in Switzerland.

The Cladistic Revolution: Darwin's Death in South Kensington

Although I would go on to spend a lifetime studying reptile anatomy, embryology, and evolution, with many a specimen from the London Natural History Museum under my microscope and scalpel, another entirely new world opened for me during my master's studies—not in the section of amphibians and reptiles of the museum, however, but in the section of fossil fishes in the department of paleontology. A scientific revolution was going on in biological systematics during those times, and the coffee room in the fossil fishes section was one of its epicenters. As an undergraduate in Basel, I had once already borrowed Willi Hennig's (1913–1976) _Grundzüge der Phylogenetischen Systematik_ (Fundamentals of phylogenetic systematics) of 1950 from the university library (Schmitt, 2013). I had sat down with large-format index cards to take excerpts from the book during what I expected to become long evenings. I soon gave up in despair, or was it ennui? The text was long and winding, the language impenetrable in places, and it was loaded with neologisms I had a hard time understanding, let alone remembering. How much easier to understand Ernst Mayr's _Principles of Systematic Zoology_ of 1969, the textbook that I had used in my work at the Basel Natural History Museum! In contrast to Mayr's more recent text, Hennig's 1950 volume had a remarkable lack of broader impact, in hindsight the result of its contorted and difficult-to-understand prose. It is fair to say that outside the circle of systematists who study insects, the book was largely ignored.

Hennig, himself an entomologist who worked first in Berlin, then in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart, must have recognized the shortfalls of his first effort. He revised his 1950 _Grundzüge_ in a manuscript that—with much delay—was translated into English at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, then published by the University of Illinois Press in 1966, without the author having approved the final text. This version of the book, entitled _Phylogenetic Systematics_ , at last triggered an intense debate between the classical evolutionary systematists à la Mayr (of which I was one), the mathematically inclined numerical taxonomists who were the first to make computers the standard tool of their trade, and Hennig's new adepts. The latter group was dubbed the cladists by Mayr, and the scientific revolution they fought and won accordingly became known as the cladistic revolution (Mayr, 1965, 1968; Hull, 1988). The term "cladistic" derives from ancient Greek _clados_ , "branch" or "twig," thus recognizing the fact that Hennig's phylogenetic system is to be represented by a strictly bifurcating treelike diagram, a cladogram, which is meant to picture successive species lineage splitting events that ultimately gave rise to the tree of life. Although the systematists who gathered for coffee in the fossil fishes section at the London Museum—not all of them specializing in the study of fossil fishes, however, but one in butterflies and others in botany—took center stage in the cladistic revolution, they became known not just as cladists but as transformed cladists, or pattern cladists (Beatty, 1982). The most charismatic and influential among them was renowned paleoichthyologist Colin Patterson (1933–1998) (Forey, Gardiner, and Humphries, 2000).

Patterson's initial transformation to a pattern cladist was motivated not through his reading of Hennig's book but rather through a monograph on Transantarctic chironomid midges published by Swedish entomologist Lars Brundin (1907–1993) in 1966—indeed an unlikely read for a paleontologist specializing in fossil fishes (Brundin, 1966). Significantly, Brundin prefaced his monograph with a summary of his understanding of Hennig's principles of phylogeny reconstruction. The publication of Brundin's monograph coincided with the arrival of a young graduate student from the University of Hawaii, who had secured a postdoctoral position at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, beginning in 1966. Gareth Nelson researched systematics and the evolutionary history of fishes for his PhD, work that motivated him to spend some time as a guest researcher at the Swedish Natural History Museum in Stockholm, Brundin's home institution (Nelson, 2014). At the time, this museum was one of the world's foremost centers for the study of fossil fishes, especially Paleozoic fishes that comprise bizarre, bottom-dwelling, and filter-feeding forms without jaws (the agnathans), as well as the putative ancestors of land-dwelling tetrapods (the crossopterygians, on which I had to write my master's thesis). While interacting with the paleontologists, Nelson shared a deep interest in biogeography with Brundin, to whom he was introduced by a resident fish paleontologist. Brundin's account of Hennig's principles electrified Nelson, as he recognized in those a method of phylogeny reconstruction far superior to the evolutionary approach championed by ornithologist Ernst Mayr and paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1902–1984) (Simpson, 1961). Nelson found that systematics, as represented in Brundin's account of Hennig's work, was no longer a matter of aesthetics, as Simpson had proclaimed, nor a matter of expert authority, as Mayr would have liked it to be, but rather a true science that was ultimately based in logic. In November of the same year, Nelson stopped over in London to inquire about a job opening at the AMNH in New York. He timed his trip to the British Museum of Natural History so he could meet a member of the search committee, Donn Rosen (1929–1986), a specialist in fish research from the AMNH visiting his British colleagues to pursue collaborative projects. Colin Patterson recalled the memorable visit: "Then, one day early in 1967, Gary Nelson, who was spending six months in the BM [British Museum (Natural History)], told me that something had just appeared in the library that I might find interesting.... It was Brundin's monograph on chironomids just arrived. I was bowled over by it—it was like discovering logic for the first time."1

In Nelson's recollection, Brundin's "critique... began the [cladistic] revolution" (2004:133), one he himself helped ignite in the natural history museums in London and New York, where he eventually landed a job. An intense discussion of cladistic principles of phylogeny reconstruction flared up, forging close ties and avid intellectual interchange between the two institutions. Brundin was invited to present, at the Fourth Nobel Symposium on Current Problems of Lower Vertebrate Phylogeny, held at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in June 1967, the insights on systematics and its relationship to paleontology that he had gained through his reading of Hennig, a presentation that both Nelson and Patterson attended (Brundin, 1968; Hull, 1988:144; for a more detailed account, and subsequent Nobel symposia, see Nelson, 2014). Opponents of cladistics judged his contribution a "vigorous defense of Hennig's view... long on rhetoric, but short on methodology" (Wake, 1970:95). Patterson saw things differently: "The heart of Brundin's paper was one message: 'phylogenetics is the search for the sister group.' That message eventually got through" (1989:472). This amounted, in Nelson's recollection, to a revolution of paleontology, as it moved the study of fossils from "the search for ancestors" to the "search for the sister group" (2014:145). Brundin's revolutionary insight gained from reading Hennig was that even in the presence of fossils, Hennig's method cannot recover sequences of ancestors and descendants, but only relative degrees of phylogenetic (evolutionary) relationships in terms of a nested hierarchy of sister groups. Two species are sister species if they uniquely share a common ancestor (stem species) that is not also ancestral to a third, more distantly related species. The same holds for more inclusive groups—that is, groups of species of common descent. Consider a species lineage evolving through time. As it splits, the stem species lineage will give rise to two daughter species lineages. These two daughter lineages will be sister species, and their descendants will form sister groups. Consider, as Hennig did, evolutionary history to consist at its core in species lineages splitting and splitting again. The graphic representation of such a history will be a dichotomously structured diagram specifying sister group relationships as they result from successive species lineage splitting events. In Hennig's account, the tree of life assumes the structure of a nested hierarchy of sister groups, not a flowchart of ancestors and descendants. The concept of sister groups came famously—and controversially—into play at the 26th Symposium of Vertebrate Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy held at Reading University in 1978, organized by Beverly Halstead, a bitter opponent of cladistics. In attendance at a special session where Hennig's principles of phylogenetic systematics were to be debated was Rex Parrington (1905–1981) from the University of Cambridge, Kermack's archrival in the study of early mammals. (Kermack claimed that Parrington had stolen some bags full of material that he had set aside in a quarry where they both excavated.) The result of the debate of Hennig's principles, in Halstead's account, "was summed up for many by Parrington's... exasperated exclamation that according to a cladist a lungfish is more closely related to a cow than to a salmon, to which C. Patterson... answered 'Yes, I cannot see what is wrong in that'" (1978:760).

The reason simply is that the lungfish and the cow share a character that is not also shared by the salmon: the presence of internal nares, or choanae, which among living animals are present in the lungfish and all tetrapods but are absent in all other (living) vertebrates. This indicates that the lungfish and the cow share a common ancestor from which they inherited the internal nares, one that is not also ancestral to the salmon, where the character is absent. In other words, the salmon descends from a species lineage-splitting event that occurred much earlier than the species lineage splitting event to which the lungfish and the cow can be traced back. Considering a salmon, a lungfish, and a cow, and no other organisms, the lungfish and the cow are thus more closely related to one another than either of them is to the salmon, as they share a more recent common ancestor that is not also ancestral to the salmon.

These were the kinds of arguments, emotions, and debates that I first encountered during my master's studies in London, drinking diluted (by Italian standards) coffee in the fossil fishes section of the Natural History Museum. I would return for years thereafter, first to listen and learn, then to participate in the discussions, which carried over from the morning coffee break to the pub at lunchtime. The group would leave the museum around noon or shortly thereafter, cross Cromwell Road, and pass by the South Kensington Tube station to stroll down Onslow Square. The destination was a pub called the Cranley. We called it the Cladists' Arms because it was there that a lot of cladistic theory emerged from discussions over ales and gin and tonics during what essentially amounted to a liquid lunch. The Gang of Four, comprising Gary Nelson's colleague, Donn Rosen, from the American Museum; Colin Patterson and his colleague, Peter L. Forey, from the British Museum (Natural History); and Brian Gardiner from Queen Elizabeth College, in London, had embarked on a highly controversial study, arguing on cladistics principles, and contrary to the received wisdom of the time, that lungfishes, not the rhipidistian lobe-finned fishes I had to write about for my master's thesis, were the sister group of tetrapods (Rosen et al., 1981). The study was published in 1981 at a time when things had further deteriorated since my year spent as a master's student in London.

The Natural History Museum in London had opened two new exhibits, Dinosaurs and Their Living Relatives in 1979 and Man's Place in Evolution in 1980, both organized around cladistic principles and both inviting visitors, through interactive stations, to take their own stab at the reconstruction of evolutionary, i.e., sister group, relationships that result from repeated species lineage splitting events. Such a move from "stuffed animals" to interactives was part of the new exhibition scheme developed and implemented by Roger Miles, an expert in fossil fishes, a cladist of the first generation, the newly appointed head of the department of public services—and of Marxist conviction, as expressed in private settings (Miles and Tout, 1978). While the interactive stations offered an opportunity to museum visitors to explore and apply the essence of cladistic methodology, the exhibit developers went further in making the claim, in the exhibit's guide, that "none of the species we are considering is the ancestor of any of the others." (Properly expressed, the controversial claim should have been, and still is, that no one species can be ancestral to one other species; any species can only be ancestral to two daughter species that result from a species lineage splitting event, which gives rise to sister species.) This statement, in its brief—indeed rudimentary, and hence misleading—wording, immediately provoked harsh criticism from Beverly Halstead, who once again raised his rattling voice against cladistics in a letter of correspondence to the prestigious science journal _Nature_ , associating cladistics with Marxist ideology along the way and proclaiming the death of scholarship at the museum (1980:208). Halstead's polemics triggered a flurry of responses in the correspondence pages of _Nature_ , one of them from Patterson, who stated boldly that "cladistics is not about evolution, but about the pattern of character distribution in organisms," i.e., about classification: "Halstead's complaint is his failure to grasp the distinction between pattern [systematics that studies the hierarchical patterns of sister group relationships] and process [the evolutionary explanation of the pattern of relationships]" (Patterson, 1980:430). Halstead retorted, calling on the director of the Natural History Museum in London to face the charges of deteriorating scholarship and political indoctrination allegedly manifest in its public exhibits: "A continued 'dignified silence' in the present circumstances is simply not good enough" (1981:742). The February 1981 issue of _Nature_ finally carried a one-page editorial titled "Darwin's Death in South Kensington," penned by the editor himself, John Maddox, who was never one to shy away from controversy:

What is the British Museum (Natural History) for? Research? Public enlightenment, even entertainment?... The museum... has not replied to the several issues which have been raised since Dr. Colin Patterson's cool comment on the role of cladistics in taxonomy [i.e., that it is not about evolution, but about classification instead]. Halstead... is right to draw attention to this deafening silence.

The editorial went on to pluck a half sentence from the latest brochure published by the museum, one that read "if the theory of evolution is true," and concluded, "The rot at the museum has gone further than Halstead ever thought. Can it be that the managers of the museum which is the nearest thing to a citadel of Darwinism have lost their nerve, not to mention their good sense?" (Maddox 1981:735; cited with permission from the publisher). How could anybody doubt, at such time as the 1970s and early 1980s of the twentieth century, the truth of evolutionary theory? At that time, it might have been at the 1982 symposium on Vertebrate Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy, held at the University of Cambridge; I remember a day of heavy rain. Attendees faced the problem of what to do with their raincoats until a janitor rolled a clothes rack into the classroom where the lectures were scheduled to be delivered. "Bev [Halstead], there's something for you to hang yourself from," Colin Patterson's sonorous voice rang from the row of back seats. Back in his office at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, Angus Bellairs raged that he could no longer take his grandson to the museum to show him the whale skeleton that had so fascinated him when he was a boy. All this occurred because the space had been taken up by a new exhibit on Human Biology ("An Exhibition of Ourselves," as it was subtitled), one that even introduced schoolchildren to such delicate issues as gender and sex. Time for a swig of sherry!

The Pupil-turned-Colleague

In 1982, I was working as a senior scientific assistant at the Paleontological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich.2 My goal was the _Habilitation_ , i.e., to write a thesis that would earn me the qualification for a career as a university docent and eventually, I hoped, professor. Haas had been instrumental in securing me this employment late in 1978, the year during which, in the spring, I had defended my PhD thesis at the University of Basel. My PhD thesis had two parts. One concerned the evolutionary relationships of anguimorph lizards (monitor lizards and their relatives) as deciphered on the basis of the anatomy of the skull and jaw adductor musculature. The other was an analysis of jaw mechanics in a monitor lizard, _Varanus salvator_ , a protected species, four juvenile specimens of which hade been seized from animal traders by Swiss customs officers and turned over to me for my research. At one point I traveled with my four lizards to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to perform electromyography on the jaw adductor muscles in the lab of one of the leading North American herpetologists, Carl Gans (1923–2009), a Jew of German extraction himself who was locked into a love–hate relationship with Georg Haas.

Gans was a workaholic, famous for his high expectations, his abrasiveness, and his wide-ranging interests in reptiles. He set himself a monument by initiating, and editing through Academic Press in London, the multivolume series Biology of the Reptilia, the first volume of which was published in 1969. Three months before leaving for Ann Arbor, I submitted a manuscript on the braincase of primitive snakes to the _Journal of Morphology_ , which at that time was edited by Gans. When I arrived in his lab, he handed the manuscript back to me, without having sent it out for peer review. He was unwilling to publish my paper, he explained, and anyway, unless I did what he told me to do, I would never get a job. Later during my stay, he asked me on a Saturday night to review a chapter for his book series by the next morning. The chapter was written by an eminent senior comparative anatomist. My endless earlier discussions of the head anatomy of reptiles with Angus Bellairs came in handy at this point. I don't remember the details, only that I found the chapter flawed. When I told Gans so Sunday morning, he turned white. The coeditor, standing next to him, broke out in laughter and exclaimed, "See, that's what you get from courting these big names of senior scientists all the time for your book series, instead of turning to younger researchers." The collection of manuscripts constituting the volume was meant to go to press more or less immediately. Would I mind rewriting the chapter, Gans asked in despair? If I agreed, he would publish my paper on the snake skulls in the _Journal of Morphology_ after all. Such was my first serious exposure to high politics in academia. I had long ago sent my manuscript to a different journal that was published in London; I lied as I claimed it had already been accepted for publication there. But I agreed to fix the chapter just so there would be no mistakes.

My lizards eventually stopped eating, as they were hurting from the electrodes I had to stick into their jaw muscles. Gans then wanted me to study drinking in pythons instead, but I declined to again hurt animals for a research question that I did not find particularly interesting. Although experimental functional anatomy was fascinating, it turned out that it was not my thing. Better to dissect pickled museum specimens and study fossils instead, neither of which would suffer from my research interests. At my thesis defense back in Basel, the dean of the faculty of natural sciences grabbed my thesis manuscript and offered to publish it, as written, in the highly prestigious _Denkschriften der Schweizerischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft_. I was surprised because during my undergraduate student years I had never been able to forge a good relationship with him as a professor; my interest in reptiles, and vertebrates in general, prevented me from recognizing any value in his uninspiring courses in invertebrate zoology. I still remember him getting hopelessly confused and lost in his account of cell fate determination in developing sea urchin embryos.

In 1979, my wife and I toured Israel on our honeymoon and took the opportunity to visit Haas at home and at work. For dinner, he scooped a mixture of cooked tomato slices and chicken hearts from an enormous cooking pot that appeared subject to continued replenishment for God only knows how long. When he introduced me to his staff at the Russian Compound, he explained in his resounding voice, "He plays the same trumpet as I do," meaning that our research interests overlapped. We had by that time started to collaborate, specifically on the head anatomy of an extremely rare burrowing lizard from New Guinea in the genus _Dibamus_ , of which a specimen from the Basel Natural History Museum had been made available for thin sectioning to allow microscopic investigation.

Lecturing at the University of Zurich, Herr Professor would take me midafternoon to a café to discuss the perplexing mid-Cretaceous snakes with well-developed hind limbs from 'Ein Yabrud. "Snakes must have had a marine origin after all," he asserted.

"You have spent a lifetime researching the origin of snakes from secretive, burrowing lizards," I retorted.

"Yes, I know, I know, but what should I do?" he exclaimed, throwing up his hands in distress. In his publication, he eventually hinted at the possibility—anathema to a cladist like me—of multiple snake origins, once from the sea and once from underground (Haas, 1979).

After coffee or ice cream, we passed the most luxurious specialty deli in Zurich. "You'll send me a package for Christmas again this year, will you?" he asked the head of staff. "You know what I like!" With that, he turned on his heels and left the store.

As I followed him, my mind wandered down the nearby Bahnhofstrasse to the headquarters of Swiss banks at the Paradeplatz, the home of highly controversial Jewish fortunes, which their owners had tragically lost through murderous persecution during World War II. Haas "died unexpectedly in his sleep, in Jerusalem on 13. Sept. 1981. Next to his bed was a suitcase, packed in readiness for yet another of his near-annual journeys to Switzerland" (Werner, 1982:491). Herr Professor and I had planned to finally put the finishing touches on the manuscript describing the skull and jaw adductor musculature of _Dibamus_ , and discussing its implications for the origin of snakes. I was left to complete the work on my own, which I dedicated to my deceased mentor.

Cladi-boy

My situation in Zurich started to slowly deteriorate—not with students but with faculty. I slowly turned into the much criticized, even ridiculed, "cladi-boy," as a professor in zoology, an ardent admirer of Ernst Mayr's work, called me. Like Patterson, I loved the logic on which the so-called transformed cladists based their systematics—their classifications. Like Patterson and his colleagues, I realized that such stringent logic cannot be compatible with Darwinian historical contingency, the serendipity that necessarily characterizes evolution driven by a process of random variation and natural selection. And like Patterson and his colleagues such as Gareth Nelson, I recognized a hierarchical structure in embryonic development that would seem relevant to the hierarchical classification of organisms based on cladistic principles. Such a tie between embryonic development and hierarchical classification had already been recognized by eminent German embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876) in a groundbreaking monograph that he published in 1828. We all agreed that evolutionary relationships, i.e., the phylogeny of organisms as reconstructed on the principles of cladistics, cannot be read off the fossil record. They can, however, be researched using embryonic development as a clue. Again, cladistics is not about ancestors and descendants but about sister group relationships, i.e., relative degrees of evolutionary relationships. If so, might it not be possible to read the phylogeny of organisms off their embryonic development? At the end of the day it is not, but we gave it the best possible try.

The retired director of the Paleontological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich, Emil Kuhn-Schnyder (1905–1994), had spent a career on the systematic excavation of Middle Triassic marine fishes and reptiles at Monte San Giorgio in southern Switzerland (canton of Ticino). Today Monte San Giorgio and its fossiliferous sediments is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. When I first arrived in Zurich, Kuhn-Schnyder told me that for him, to dig through successive layers of fossiliferous rock was the same as to leaf through the pages of an illustrated book on evolution. Small wonder he could not stomach the emergence of cladistics. Nor could his successor, my supervisor, Hans Rieber, an invertebrate paleontologist. Nor could any one among the biology professors at the university at the time. In 1983, I published a book titled _Kladismus oder die Legende vom Stammbaum_ (Cladistics, or the legend of the phylogenetic tree). It earned me applause from my students and a sympathetic review in the conservative _Neue Zürcher Zeitung_ that praised the theoretical austerity of cladistic principles, but in the eyes of Kuhn-Schnyder and Rieber (1984), the time had come to expose the creationist implications of cladistics. Academic freedom was enshrined in the system; I kept my job. But I successively lost my privileges, eventually even the free access to the collections of fossil fishes and reptiles from Monte San Giorgio that I had originally been hired to curate. With the help of a friend on the staff of the university library, I turned to secretive studies of eighteenth-century French biology. Naturalist turned philosopher Charles Bonnet (1720–1793) from Geneva became my new hero: to this day, his _Palingénésie Philosophique_ , published in two volumes in 1769, remains one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.

One day in the late 1980s, Peter Crane, then curator of fossil plants (paleobotany) at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, was brought to my office. Crane, one of the few first-generation cladists among botanists, was on an extended research visit to the Institute of Botany at the University of Zurich. My publications on the head anatomy of lizards and primitive snakes and on the fossil fishes and reptiles from Monte San Giorgio had by that time started to earn me some international reputation. But that was not what Crane came to see me about. He wanted to talk cladistics, especially now, after my book on the _Fundamentals of Comparative Biology_ , published in 1988, had earned a favorable review by Gareth Nelson (1989) in the leading journal _Systematic Zoology_. Someone told me that one morning, Gary Nelson showed up for coffee break in his department at the AMNH, slammed my recently published book on the table, and said, "I liked that." In the course of our conversation, Crane must have realized how unhappy I was in my position. Back in Chicago, Crane informed the department of geology at the Field Museum of Natural History, where a curatorial line had become vacant, of my situation, alluding to the fact that I might be "movable," as they say in academic circles. Crossing Grant Park on my way to my job interview at the Field Museum on a sunny morning, I sensed a feeling of immense relief and liberation. A few months later, on my way to my new position in Chicago, the flight attendants on Swissair served up a bottle of Champagne for me that had been ordered as a going-away gift by the students I left behind. I started my job as curator of fossil amphibians and reptiles at the Field Museum in May 1990.

Working in Zurich, I had acquired familiarity with the diversity of Triassic marine reptiles, especially the sauropterygians, which were represented in large numbers. But my work remained more or less restricted to the material from Monte San Giorgio and from an equivalent neighboring locality just across the border in Lombardy, northern Italy. Swiss civil servants such as university employees at the time did not travel much, and if they did, they rarely went on extended trips. In any case, that was the policy of my supervisor, Professor Hans Rieber. Now in Chicago, I felt the possibility to embark on a far-flung, indeed global, review of Triassic sauropterygians. The sauropterygians are a branch on the reptile tree of life, i.e., a clade of reptiles that secondarily invaded the sea early in the Triassic. They first show up in the fossil record in the late Early Triassic, about 250 million years ago. Thereafter, they rapidly diversified. All the various groups were already represented in the sediments of Monte San Giorgio, spanning a period of 245 to 235 million years ago. There were the placodonts, carrying large, flat tooth plates in their upper and lower jaws indicating a diet of hard-shelled invertebrate prey. Some of these placodonts developed a bony armor, seemingly much like turtles do. There were the smaller pachypleurosaurs, lizardlike animals with thickened vertebrae and ribs that inhabited coastal waters. Related to them are the larger nothosaurs, which diversified in shallow and warm-water seas that had developed as a consequence of a general sea-level rise during the Early Triassic, flooding low-lying areas of continents. The skull of advanced nothosaurs was elongate and very low, with the long jaws carrying protruding fangs that well equipped them to catch squid and fish with a sudden sideways snapping bite. Some of the larger nothosaurs occasionally ventured farther into the sea, as indicated by the supernumerary phalanges they developed in their hands and feet, rendering those larger and more efficient for paddling. All of these forms went extinct in the course of the Late Triassic, some 205 million years ago, a time when the climate got hotter and the sea level dropped, causing their habitats to disappear. Only the Triassic pistosaurs, more distantly related to the nothosaurs but outwardly of similar build, survived in a certain sense: they gave rise, at the end of the Triassic, to the more widely known plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, and elasmosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous seas. These large creatures roamed the deep waters of the open ocean, their limbs transformed into flippers. These were the famous sea monsters featured in Victorian accounts of extinct life. Some claim they still see them today in Loch Ness in Scotland.

The marine biota of the Triassic harbored a great variety of sauropterygians, all of them adapted to shallow-water near-coastal environments, and hence more regionally distributed than their Jurassic and Cretaceous descendants that roamed the open sea. They offered a rich potential for systematic revision, phylogeny reconstruction, functional anatomical analysis, and paleobiogeographic studies at a time when modern continents only just started to take shape. How did terrestrial reptiles anatomically and functionally adapt to a life in the sea? How did they diversify, where, and how fast? How were the species of sauropterygians distributed in time and space, and how did their distribution relate to the slowly progressing evolution of modern continents? Questions over questions, which—accustomed to the Swiss system—I carefully outlined in my first grant proposal to the US National Science Foundation (NSF). It was rejected. My new colleagues at the Field Museum sat me down, however, and taught me how to write an NSF grant proposal the American way. I scored the next one. I had more money for research travel and equipment than I could ever have hoped to get in Switzerland. The State Museum of Baden-Württemberg (where Willi Hennig had worked during the second half of his career), now located in Stuttgart instead of Ludwigsburg and holding exquisite collections of Triassic sauropterygians from the German Muschelkalk, was for me from a logistic point of view closer to Chicago than to Zurich. The world was wide open; the journey could begin. In order to properly research the pattern of sauropterygian diversification and distribution throughout the Triassic period, I first needed to locate their proper place on the evolutionary tree of reptiles as a whole, however. Nobody had tried to do so on cladistic principles before.

Misplaced Turtles

I rushed to amass as many characters as I could that would allow me to assess the evolutionary relationships of sauropterygians within the reptiles as a whole. I needed to score these characters across the whole variety of reptiles, representing all major groups from the Paleozoic to the present. That, however, included not just crocodiles, lizards, and snakes, their fossil relatives, and many others, but also turtles. I had little experience working with turtles. I had done some work on the anatomy and embryonic development of the skull and associated jaw adductor muscles in the snapping turtle _Chelydra serpentina_ , and I had used the same species to investigate patterns of ossification throughout the skeleton (Rieppel, 1976, 1977, 1990, 1993a). In the collections of the institute in Zurich, there was also a skull of a Jurassic turtle from the area of the city Solothurn, roughly 155 million years old, that I had described, along with comments on the evolution of the braincase in turtles (Rieppel, 1980). But a turtle specialist I was not. Once I had assembled what I thought was sufficient evidence and encoded it, I ran it through my computer—with most unexpected results. Never before had sauropterygians been included in an analysis of evolutionary relationships across the whole range of reptile diversity. The inclusion of sauropterygians into the analysis of reptile interrelationships pulled the turtles from the root system of the reptile family tree, where they had traditionally been placed, all the way up into the upper crown. Goodrich's memoir came to mind—the way I had struggled to understand his remarks on the turtle skull while sitting in the plane on my way to London. I had an anomaly on my hands, a maverick, if not heretical, hypothesis of turtle relationships, one universally rejected by the accredited vertebrate paleontologists of the time, yet one that Goodrich seemed to have thought of as well. I remembered Haas, who had agonized about his marine mid-Cretaceous snakes with well-developed hind limbs, and their implications for snake origins from sea or land. Now it was my turn to throw up my arms and ask myself, what should I do?

I had always had an interest in philosophy of science. When I was an undergraduate, Karl R. Popper (1902–1994) was my favorite philosopher of science. He enjoyed an enormous reputation, at least among scientists. Like Haas, he was the scion of a Jewish family born in Vienna, but his parents had converted to Lutheranism before he was born. In 1937 he emigrated to New Zealand, and then in 1946 he moved on to England, were he obtained a position at the London School of Economics. He ended his stellar career as Sir Karl. A friend of mine, a professional philosopher, urged me to leave Popper behind, to move on and look at the work of more modern, avant-garde philosophers of science such as Thomas S. Kuhn, who had written about scientific revolutions, but I would have none of it. I cannot pretend to have fully understood at the time what Popper was saying, or rather writing about, in his 1934 volume _Logik der Forschung_ (published in English in 1959 as _The Logic of Scientific_ Discovery)—not as an undergraduate, and not when I was first facing the conundrum of turtle relationships. It would take me another ten years to come to grips with his hard-core hypothetico-deductivism and its significance—or rather lack thereof—for practical, i.e., empirical, science.

My enthusiasm for Popper's philosophy of science was fueled by the fact that fellow cladists tried to cast systematics as a science that would measure up to those criteria of a true science that had been articulated by Popper—quite in contrast to Mayr's _Principles of Systematic Zoology_ (1969), which they dismissed as a pseudoscience. Roger Miles from the British Museum (Natural History) was among the first ones to do so. It also did not help my understanding of Popper that cladists from the AMNH misrepresented Popper's philosophy to some degree as they tried to make it work for cladistics in a series of reviews of Popper's books, which they published in the journal _Systematic Zoology_ (Rieppel, 2009). The way I understood Popper was that science can never obtain secure knowledge; it can never obtain the truth. But it can test a given hypothesis and in the process potentially falsify it, thus opening a door to learn from negatives. Conversely, according to Popper, only those hypotheses and theories can be considered scientific that lend themselves to test and potential falsification. For Popper, science is like a hugely complicated building with theories as its building blocks. That building, Popper argued, was erected on a swamp, and while science could ram the pillars supporting that building ever deeper into the ground, it could never reach firm bedrock. Taking Popper to heart, I decided not to simply ignore my result about turtle relationships but to put this result out there for others (and myself) to test further, and to possibly falsify. The heretical hypothesis of turtle relationships far up in the reptile tree thus made its way into the first major monograph that resulted from my NSF-sponsored sauropterygian research; it also contained a discussion of sauropterygian relationships within reptiles as a whole. One of the reviewers, a colleague and friend, urged me to put the strange turtle business into an appendix, so that it would not detract from the main point of my paper. So I did. "The results remain problematical," I conceded in that appendix, yet at the same time,

the results remain interesting... because if nature is hierarchically ordered... then the relationships of any three taxa should remain stable (if they reflect history) no matter how many taxa are later added to the analysis: the lungfish should always come out closer to the cow than to the trout, no matter how many other "fishes" or tetrapods are subsequently added to the analysis. (Rieppel, 1994:82)

There was a glaring hole in my analysis, however, and that was my relative ignorance of Paleozoic reptiles, stem-reptiles some 250 to 300 million years old, to which turtles had traditionally been thought to be related. I needed help, so I turned to another colleague and friend of mine, Robert Reisz, a top expert on Paleozoic reptiles from the University of Toronto. At first he thought I was joking; then said he was too involved with a host of other projects to take on yet another one. But he had a graduate student, Michael deBraga, who was interested in collaborating and making research on turtle relationships part of his PhD thesis. In an effort to test the earlier result, we scrutinized the data and added to them—Michael of course not only for a host of Paleozoic reptiles but also for synapsids, the earliest fossil relatives of mammals. The signal was confirmed, with the turtles high up in the reptile tree. The results of our collaboration were duly published in 1996 in _Nature_. The following year, Gene Gaffney, then the undisputed leader in the study of fossil turtles and turtle evolution from the AMNH, organized a turtle symposium under the umbrella of the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in New York that year. When I got up to deliver a presentation of our findings, Gaffney introduced my talk with the words, "And now everybody may hiss as much as you like" (<http://www.dlblanc.com/coloherp/cb-news/archive/taxonomy/TurtleTax.php>, accessed June 20, 2016).

Yet our paper motivated a number of molecular systematists, working with DNA data, to test turtle relationships (on which more later). When the first large-scale molecular study, published in _Science_ in February 1999, robustly confirmed heterodox turtle relationships, the story made the front page of the _New York Times_ (Hedges and Poling, 1999; Yoon, 1999). Later that same year, I received an invitation to contribute a chapter on turtle origins to the highly prestigious book series Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics (Rieppel and Reisz, 1999). I agreed, but only on the condition that Robert Reisz would coauthor the paper. The editor hesitated, saying that this could throw the whole project into jeopardy. My answer was that if Robert's input would show the novel placement of turtles high up on the reptile tree to be wrong, then that hypothesis ought not be perpetuated. Eventually the editor agreed, and with such a prestigious outlet, Robert became interested in collaboration after all. So I applied for a Field Museum scholarship to bring him to Chicago.

Once he was set up in his hotel, Robert strolled into my office one morning and announced in a weighty voice, "I will now start going through your data matrix"—the one that Michael deBraga and I had put together, which in the meantime had been published in detail in the _Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society_ (deBraga and Rieppel, 1997). While Robert critically scanned through our database, surely expecting to see the strange reptile tree it supported to eventually fall apart, I turned to the study of the embryonic development of the turtle shell, with stunning surprises in store. Robert found a few mistakes, as is common in phylogenetic analyses of such broad scope, but the heterodox result was once again confirmed. Our collaboration resulted in the identification of three main problem areas relevant to the question of turtle origins.

The first is the assessment of the precise relationships of turtles within reptiles as a whole, or, in cladistic terms, the identification of the sister group of turtles. A well-supported hypothesis concerning turtle relationships within reptiles as a whole is an indispensable prerequisite for an understanding of which aspects of turtle anatomy, physiology, and behavior are primitive and which ones are evolutionarily advanced, or specialized. If turtles were the sister group of some branch of Paleozoic reptiles, then they might indeed represent living fossils—but not so if turtles nested high up in the reptile tree.

The second problem area concerns this most extraordinary characteristic of turtles: the turtle shell. In virtue of its shell, the turtle differs radically from other tetrapods, both in its anatomy and its physiology (Jackson, 2011). Here is a poor creature encased in a rigid shell; how does it move about, ever so clumsily? How does it breathe? Compared to a lizard or a crocodile, a turtle looks truly monstrous. What are the evolutionary mechanisms at work in such a transformation, and how well can they be accommodated by a strictly Darwinian account of evolution?

The third problem area concerns the environment within which such radical reorganization of the tetrapod body plan took place. In Darwin's account, evolutionary transformation promotes adaptation. Is it possible to explain the origin of the turtle body plan, and the evolution of the turtle shell specifically, in adaptive terms? If so, in which way would the turtle shell represent an adaptation? Darwin opened his groundbreaking _On the Origin of Species_ of 1859, with a quote from a letter renowned astronomer Sir John Frederick Herschel (1792–1871) had posted from Cape Colony in South Africa to the leading British geologist of the time, Charles Lyell (1797–1875), on February 20, 1836. In the course of his geological studies, Lyell had recognized that species go extinct, i.e., disappear from the fossil record and hence from the surface of the globe. He had no answer to the question, however, of how those extinct species were replaced through geologic time by new and different ones, as was indeed documented by the fossil record. "Of course I allude to that mystery of mysteries," Herschel wrote, "the replacement of extinct species by others" (Cannon, 1961:305). Darwin in turn hoped to "throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers" (1859:1). It might indeed similarly be argued that the origin of turtles constitutes such a mystery of mysteries for those trying not only to reconstruct the tree of life but also to understand the evolutionary mechanisms that promote such fundamental anatomical transformations as are represented by the turtle and its shell. The two mysteries are intimately interconnected; it is precisely the fundamental transformation of the tetrapod body plan that renders the placement of turtles on the reptile tree of life so difficult.

Early Debates on Turtle Relationships

THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS IN WHAT IN LATIN—at the time the universal language of science—was called a _systema naturae_ , a system of nature's contents, was first formalized by Swedish botanist Carl von Linné, better known under the Latinized version of his name, Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778), with which he signed his publications. It was Linnaeus who introduced the binomial nomenclature for species, where each species name comprises two terms, the name of the genus to which the species belongs and the specific epithet naming the species in its genus. For example, the neighbor's dog is part of the species _Canis familiaris_ : _Canis_ is the genus name, and _familiaris_ is the specific epithet that distinguishes the family dog from other species in the same genus, such as _Canis lupus_ , the gray wolf. Having thus established a formal framework for the naming of species, Linnaeus then sorted genera into families, families into orders, and orders into classes in a hierarchical classificatory scheme that is still in use today. Most importantly, Linnaeus distinguished an artificial from a natural system. The artificial system would be the one that reflects the logic of human thought; the natural system, in contrast, would reflect "affinities"—that is, something like overall similarity among species. The artificial system is built on the logical subdivision of nature's contents in terms of dichotomies: teeth present or absent; claws present or absent. The natural system, in contrast, tries to capture all the subtle similarities or differences between species: the greater and more numerous the similarities, the closer the affinity between species.

At the time of Linnaeus's writing, the term "affinity" was meant to express degrees of structural similarity, not evolutionary relationships, the latter a connotation that the term "affinity" acquired only later, most prominently through the influence of Charles Darwin. Linnaeus distinguished plant genera primarily on the basis of the geometrical arrangement of the reproductive organs in plants, such as the sepals and petals, the carpels and stamens in flowers (Stevens, 1994:12). The genera, once recognized and diagnosed, were then sorted into families, these into orders, and the latter into classes using two different methods. One method enforces a regular dichotomous subdivision in a way that ensures the easy and unequivocal identification of each genus. The result resembles a dichotomously structured identification key and was called an artificial system by Linnaeus, who flattered himself to have been the first to have consistently implemented it in botany (Daudin, 1926:38). The other method would take into account as best as possible all the variable degrees of similarity and consequent affinity between genera that can be discerned by a detailed comparative study of the entire plant anatomy. The resulting natural system would thus capture a "network of affinities," which Linnaeus expressed in the metaphor of a maplike structure with mutual affinities on all sides (Daudin, 1926:47; Müller-Wille, 2007).

What survived the test of time are Linnaeus's hierarchical system of classification and its associated nomenclature, as well as the principle of dichotomization of nature in biological classification. A nice example (among many others) for the application of the principle of dichotomy to animal classification that relates to turtles was provided by Constant Duméril (1774–1860), a disciple of the famous Georges Cuvier (of whom much more later) at the National Natural History Museum in Paris. Duméril called his approach to animal classification _zoologie analytique_ (analytical zoology), thus underscoring its logical structure.

Duméril's 1805 classification of amphibians and reptiles is built on the presence or absence of certain characters: limbs present (lizards + crocs, turtles, amphibians) or limbs absent (snakes); claws present (lizards + crocs, turtles) or claws absent (amphibians); teeth present (lizards + crocs) or teeth absent (turtles). The logic underlying this classification is impeccable, but the biology is obviously flawed. Snakes would certainly seem to be more closely related to lizards and crocs than would frogs and salamanders. But to be entirely fair to Duméril, it should be noted that at the time, obscure and little understood limbless amphibians, the caecilians or gymnophionans, were grouped with snakes, thus obscuring the latter group's otherwise obvious reptile relationships.

The pressure to capture natural affinities, i.e., historical relations in biological classification, increased with the dawn of evolutionary thought. With Charles Darwin, the idea that new species arise from ancestral ones—one that had been around for quite a while—was for the first time validated through an explanation based on entirely natural causes: variation and natural selection. When thinking about the way these mechanisms would promote species origination, Darwin—in his notebook B, which he started in July 1837—drew a famous sketch, a treelike branching diagram that today, in its more fleshed-out version, is known as the tree of life.1 Darwin intended the branching in the tree to represent the splitting of an ancestral species lineage into descendant ones. Since then, a treelike branching diagram has become the paradigmatic way to represent evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships, although it is well known that some organisms enter into reticulated evolutionary relationships that would have to be graphically represented as a network. One of these mechanisms is the origin of a new species through hybridization between two parental species, a mode of species origination that is relatively frequent in plants and that had already been recognized by Linnaeus. Another mechanism promoting a network of relationships is the transfer of genes, or bits of DNA, between organisms that belong to two or more different species, a process called either horizontal or lateral gene transfer. This is most frequently—but not exclusively—observed among bacteria and unicellular organisms, the protists. Even so, and especially for more complex, multicellular organisms, a hierarchical system that can be graphically represented as a branching tree of life remains the best way to capture evolutionary relationships, i.e., the successive splitting of species lineages. The information such a system is meant to convey is no longer to facilitate the identification and reidentification of species and genera, however, as was the case in Linnaeus's day, before the theory of evolution. After Darwin, such a natural system is meant to represent the evolutionary, i.e., phylogenetic, relationships among species and genera.

But why the need to introduce a new, special term—phylogeny—to refer to descent with modification? The reason is the long, checkered history of the term "evolution" (from French _évolution_ ). It was first introduced into biology to denote the unfolding of the embryo during its development (Bowler, 1975). Many prominent eighteenth-century French biologists and philosophers believed the embryo to preexist in its entirety, with all its parts present, in the egg produced by females. (A rival theory located the preexisting embryo in the head portion of the spermatozoon produced by males.) The elusiveness of such preexisting embryos in chicken eggs opened for inspection was attributed to their exceedingly small size and the transparency of the tissues. On that account, embryonic development is simply a process of the successive unfolding—through nutrition, growth, and enlargement—of preexisting structures, and the French term for "unfolding" is _évolution_. Only later did the term come to refer to the Darwinian process of descent with modification. It may be such ambiguity in meaning that motivated Darwin to use the term only once in his _Origin_ , in the very last sentence: "From so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved" (Darwin, 1859:490). To disambiguate the language of biology, Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919)—the German Darwin, as many called him—introduced the term "ontogeny" to refer to embryonic development, while the term "phylogeny" he introduced to refer to evolutionary development, i.e., descent with modification.

But the ontogeny–phylogeny distinction was not the only innovation that Haeckel brought to the language of biology. In his immensely influential 1866 treatise, _Generelle Morphologie_ , a two-volume tract on animal comparative anatomy, ontogeny, and phylogeny, Haeckel was the first to introduce the term "monophyletic," and he was also the first to provide graphic renditions of phylogenetic trees. A phylogenetic tree with a single root, instead of multiple separate roots, Haeckel called a monophyletic tree ( _mono_ , "single," and _phyletic_ , "evolutionary"; a monophyletic tree has a single evolutionary origin). Haeckel returned to the concept of monophyly many times in his later writings, leaving behind a legacy that left the term poorly defined—indeed rather ambiguous—in its meaning. But on a charitable reading of his first use of the term in his treatise of 1866, one could argue that Haeckel initially wanted monophyly to apply to a tree that depicts the evolutionary history of a section of the animal kingdom that derives from a single common ancestor—hence the single root. Unicellular organisms, the protists, Haeckel did not believe to form a monophyletic group. Instead, he believed the great diversity of protists to have had multiple independent evolutionary origins, the protists collectively thus constituting a polyphyletic group ( _poly_ , "multiple," and _phyletic_ "evolutionary"; a polyphyletic tree has multiple roots, or evolutionary origins). Conversely, and in modern parlance, a monophyletic group is a group of organisms that comprises their most recent common ancestor and all, and only, its descendants. Each human being has a unique origin, from a specific egg fertilized by a specific spermatozoan. Many philosophers argue that it is this particular, unique origin that individuates a human being, i.e., renders each human being a unique individual. Similarly, these philosophers argue, it is the uniqueness of its evolutionary origin that individuates a species (renders a species an individual), and hence also the group that comprises all, and only, the descendants of a certain (stem) species.

**2.2.** First use of term "monophyly" by Ernst Haeckel, in text accompanying plate I in volume 2 of _Generelle Morphologie_ (1866). At right bottom corner of plate I, he writes: "Monophyletic genealogic tree of organisms, mapped out and drawn by Ernst Haeckel, Jena, 1866."

A modern classification is required to represent the phylogenetic relationships of organisms and thus to correspond to a natural system, not an artificial one. Because new species originate from ancestral species through speciation, and because speciation is generally (but not uncontroversially) held to result from the splitting of a species lineage into two daughter species, the natural system is graphically represented by a dichotomously branching treelike diagram, which cladists call a cladogram. The classification that corresponds to such a cladogram is considered natural if all the groups of species it contains are monophyletic. Placing turtles either close to the root of the reptile tree or far up in its crown will thus imply radically different phylogenetic relationships of turtles, and hence also a radically different classification of turtles within a hierarchical system of monophyletic groups of reptiles. Placing turtles near the root of the reptile tree renders them archaic survivors of ancestral species that went extinct 250 and more million years ago. With turtles nesting in the crown of the reptile tree, these archaic-looking creatures suddenly become modernized. This has important consequences. If turtles are something like living fossils, physiologists, for example, would have reason to believe that body functions in turtles represent the primitive condition for reptiles and their descendants, the birds. This would not be the case if turtles nest high up in the reptile tree.

Well into the twentieth century, reptile classification remained rather fluid, indeed controversial. The basic groups of living reptiles, such as turtles, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes, had long been recognized, but their precise composition, and especially their relationship to one another, remained a matter of debate. An early contribution that triggered an extensive, long-lasting conversation came from a young Germanborn paleontologist, Georg Baur (1859–1898), who in the years 1884–1890 served as assistant to paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh (1831–1899) at Yale University. Marsh, as is widely known among dinosaur aficionados, was locked in an epic battle against his archrival from Philadelphia, Edward Drinker Cope (1840–1897). The two men fought over dinosaur bones dug up in the American West, engaging in a race for priority in the description of as many of new dinosaur species as possible. They have been immortalized as protagonists of the so-called bone wars or dinosaur wars, which often took ethical standards of science to their limit—and even beyond. Intrigues between the excavation crews they sent to the boneyards out West sabotaged fieldwork, publications were predated in order to secure priority of species descriptions, and accusations of theft of fossils and plagiarism all intertwined in a rivalry that had reached its pinnacle by the end of the 1870s. Baur stepped out of Marsh's shadow much later, and in a much less controversial manner, with a contribution on the reptile skull that he published in the _Journal of Morphology_ in 1889. Baur's paper is short, a compact read that presupposes foundational knowledge of the reptile skull in order to be understood. Such fundamental knowledge of the structure of the reptile skull is likewise required to understand reptile classification and the problem of turtle relationships. The reptile skull is better understood, however, from a bottom-up perspective (from fish to reptile) rather than from a top-down perspective (from mammal to reptile), as the bottom-up perspective also represents the evolutionary trajectory.

When considering a dog, a human, or any other mammal, the skull appears—at least superficially—to be a relatively simple structure: a cranial box housing the brain, two eye sockets, and paired openings for the nose and ears, respectively. On that cranial box hinges the lower jaw. That will do for most conversations at Halloween parties; only students of anatomy will have to delve into the details that characterize the many cranial bones and the multiple openings transmitting cranial nerves. What seems simple at the level of mammals is, however, an evolutionarily highly derived condition, resulting in a structure that, in terms of its evolutionary history, is intricate and highly complex. This is not the place to trace the evolutionary history of the mammalian skull, however. But we do need to understand some of the evolutionary history of the reptile skull to get a handle on reptile classification. So let's start with fish—say, some bony fish, such as a gar or bowfin. Here, the skull is composed of three evolutionarily independent yet tightly interrelated structural components. In the lower vertebrates, the skull can be best comprehended on the model of Russian nesting dolls, with an outer shell (the enclosing doll) comprising an inner shell (the enclosed doll), and space between the two to accommodate third-component elements. Perhaps it is anatomically more correct to say, as the eminent American paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer (1894–1973) did, that the skull in a gar or bowfin, but also that of a sea turtle, for example, forms a system composed of two telescoped bony cylinders, the larger, outer one (first component) enclosing the smaller, inner one (second component), with space between the two to accommodate third-component elements. The inner cylinder is the braincase, housing the brain and the sense organs such as the nasal capsules, the eye sockets, and the ear capsules. The braincase is preformed in cartilage in the embryo and may persist in a cartilaginous state in the adult at least in some of its parts, while in other parts the cartilage may be replaced by bone in a process called ossification. Because it encapsulates the brain, the braincase is also known as the neurocranium. And because of its position inside the outer bony cylinder, the braincase is sometimes also called the endocranium. Given its deep position relative to the outer bony cylinder, and given the fact that the whole structure is preformed in cartilage before part of it may ossify, the braincase is a component of the inner skeleton, or endoskeleton, derived from the ancient Greek term _endon_ , "within."

**2.3.** Schematic and idealized representation of primitive structure of vertebrate skull.

_Redrawn after Portmann, 1976, fig. 78; drawing by Marlene Donnelly, The Field Museum_.

The outer bony cylinder is, by comparison, part of the outer skeleton, or exoskeleton, derived from the Greek exo, "outside." It is a protective covering of the head and of the anterior braincase floor made up of bones that ossify directly in the deeper layer of the skin, the dermis, without any cartilaginous precursors. The skin of vertebrates has two layers: the outer epidermis (the Greek prefix _epi_ \- means "above") and the inner dermis. Flakes of skin that peel off our body as a consequence of a sunburn are superficial layers of the epidermis, as is the "skin" periodically shed by lizards and snakes. A cut that results in bleeding has penetrated the epidermis and reached the underlying dermis. Bone that ossifies directly in the dermis without being preformed in cartilage is accordingly called dermal bone. The outer cylinder of the skull is correspondingly called the dermatocranium. In the space that remains between the neurocranium and the dermatocranium are located the gill arches and their associated musculature. The gill arches are collectively referred to as the splanch-nocranium, and being preformed in cartilage during development, they are again endoskeletal structures. The jaw apparatus of jawed vertebrates (the gnathostomes) evolved from the anteriormost two gill arches. But this also means that the muscles operating the jaws must be located in the space between the outer dermatocranium and the inner neurocranium. In the adult human skull, as in other mammals, the endoskeletal neurocranium (the inner cylinder) and the exoskeletal dermatocranium (the outer cylinder) have combined to form a single unified cranial box, rendering the original components difficult to discern. The jaw muscles are consequently superficially positioned on the skull. Ossified remnants of the ancestral gill arch skeleton are retained in mammals in form of a bone (alisphenoid) located just behind the eye socket (orbit) as well as in the three ear ossicles; other parts of the ancestral gill arch skeleton are retained in the throat skeleton. The seemingly simple cranial box so characteristic of mammals is thus revealed to be a highly complex structure comprising elements from three systems, each of which has its own evolutionary history: the braincase, the dermatocranium, and the ancestral gill arch skeleton.

With that introduction, we should now be ready to follow Baur's expositions on the reptile skull. Baur's 1889 paper had two parts to it. The first dealt with the braincase in ways that are not relevant here. The second treated the various modifications that affect the temporal region in the dermatocranium, also called the cheek region, located behind the eye socket (orbit) in the reptile skull. Baur recognized that by comparison with ancestral (fossil) amphibians, a complete dermal roofing of the temporal region of the skull—as it occurs in the earliest stem-reptiles from the Paleozoic—is primitive for the group. In this primitive condition, the outer dermal covering of the skull behind the eye socket is complete, concealing the muscles that operate the jaws from view. However, this primitive condition of the reptile skull was modified in various ways during the evolution of reptiles, mostly in ways that would reduce the dermal covering of the cheek region. Crocodiles, for example, and their fossil relatives, such as dinosaurs, as well as the tuatara from islands around New Zealand, develop two openings, or fenestrae (Latin for "windows"), in the temporal region of the skull (dermatocranium), one located above the other. Thus there is on either side of a crocodile or tuatara skull, from front to back, an external naris, an eye socket, and an upper and lower temporal fenestra. The bony bar that separates the upper from the lower temporal fenestra is called the upper temporal arch, or arcade; the bony bar that closes the lower temporal fossa along the lower (ventral) margin of the cheek region is called the lower temporal arch, or arcade. The functional reasons for the initial evolution of such temporal fenestration remain poorly understood. Lizards have only an upper temporal fenestra bounded by an upper temporal arch. Below that, the cheek region is wide open, i.e., not covered by dermal bone. The lower temporal arch has been lost. Snakes have a wide-open temporal region of the skull, with no trace of an upper or lower temporal arch. Such further modifications in the temporal region of the dermatocranium had important yet different consequences for the jaw mechanics in lizards and snakes. The wide-open temporal region in the snake skull, for example, allowed for a rearrangement of the jaw adductor musculature, now located in a superficial position that made it possible, for evolutionarily advanced snakes, to feed on prey that has a diameter larger than the diameter of the snake's own head.

In turtles, things are different yet variable again, and hence less easily assessed. Sea turtles, like the leatherback sea turtle ( _Dermochelys coriacea_ ) or the green sea turtle ( _Chelonia mydas_ ), have a complete dermatocranial covering across the temporal region of the skull. The dermatocranium thus forms a complete outer cylinder enclosing the inner cylinder (braincase), with the jaw muscles accommodated between the two. That would seem to correspond to the primitive condition for reptiles, as exemplified by Paleozoic stem-reptiles. The problem already noted by Goodrich in his 1930 textbook is that the number of bones making up the complete dermatocranial covering of the cheek region is smaller in turtles than in primitive reptiles. Some bony elements have been lost in turtles; others have correspondingly expanded, or perhaps some have fused with their neighbors in the course of turtle evolution. In other turtles, the dermal covering of the cheek has been reduced in a way that can, in certain extreme cases, mimic the presence of an upper temporal arch. In yet others, the temporal region of the skull lacks any dermatocranial covering.

How to make sense of this variation? The first question to ask, of course, is whether the complete dermatocranial covering of the cheek region in modern sea turtle skulls by a reduced number of bony elements does indeed correspond to the primitive reptile condition, or whether this is a secondary development—a secondary "roofing over," as was argued by Goodrich in his classic text of 1930. Setting this question aside, Baur further recognized that if the dermal covering of the cheek region is reduced—to variable degrees—in turtles, this never occurs through the development of any fenestration such as is the case in crocodiles, dinosaurs, or the tuatara. Instead, the bony covering of the cheek region is reduced by emargination: bone is, metaphorically speaking, eaten away from the back margin of the skull forward and from the lower margin of the skull upward, creating deep embayments in the upper and lower cheek region. As this process continues, the dermal covering of the cheek region is eventually reduced to a slender bar of bone that mimics an upper temporal arch, until even that disappears.

Putting a series of turtle skulls on a table alongside a skull of a crocodile, of the tuatara, of a lizard, and of a snake renders several comparative judgments possible. The crocodile and the tuatara have two temporal openings, or fenestrae, behind the eye socket, each bounded by the upper and lower temporal arch. They thus differ fundamentally from turtles. The lizard has only an upper temporal fenestra bounded by an upper temporal arch, but the cheek below it is wide open. Outwardly, some lizards, especially agamids, look very much like the tuatara, and the condition of the dermatocranium in the temporal region of the lizard skull would indeed seem to be easily explained as a consequence of the loss of the lower temporal arch. Snakes, with a completely open temporal region of the skull, could then be said to have lost both the lower and upper temporal arches. This is precisely the opinion Baur had previously held, but he later changed his mind: "It seems very much probable that the Squamata [i.e., lizards and snakes] never possessed an infratemporal fossa [a lower temporal fenestra], but that the broad arch was reduced [by emargination] from below as in the Testudinata," i.e., as in turtles (1889:473). The implication here is that unlike the tuatara, ancestral lizards would have had an upper temporal fenestra only, while the der-matocranial covering of the cheek region would have been complete below it. In the course of lizard evolution, this lower part of the cheek region would have become emarginated, eventually to a degree that only a slender bar of bone was left to close off the upper temporal fenestra. In snakes, even that bar of bone would then have been eaten away through reduction. The implication (which he did not spell out) of Baur's change of mind, then, is that lizards (and snakes) share an evolutionary pattern of reduction in the cheek region of the dermatocranium with turtles and not with crocodiles, dinosaurs, and the tuatara. On that account, lizards (and snakes) would be more closely related to turtles than to crocodiles, dinosaurs, and the tuatara.

That implied conclusion certainly did not sit well with his supervisor's archrival, Cope. "At the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, held in Troy, N.Y., in 1870," he had presented his views on the significance of the differentiation of the dermatocranium in the temporal region of the reptile skull (Cope, 1892:11; see Cope, 1871). "It is evident that the correct classification and phylogeny of the Reptilia will not be completed without" a proper understanding of the dermatocranial arches in the skull of reptiles, he continued, and—quoting extensively from Baur's 1889 paper—cited the latter's view that lizards never had a lower temporal fenestra and arch but instead had emarginated the lower cheek region in a turtlelike manner. Cope then launched into an extensive review of reptile skulls, first in Paleozoic and then in Mesozoic forms, to which living forms could be related. On the basis of his interpretations, Cope derived turtles directly from Paleozoic stem-reptiles then called "Cotylosauria," while the lizards he characterized—in contrast to Baur's revised opinion—as having lost the lower temporal arch that forms the ventral closure of the lower temporal fossa in the tuatara. He believed the snakes to have lost the upper temporal arch as well, thus fully opening up the temporal region of the skull. It might perhaps seem difficult to understand why paleontologists would get caught up in such esoteric debates, but they did because the results mattered. Both Baur and Cope agreed that the primitive reptile skull had a completely covered cheek region. They also both agreed that turtles reduced the bony covering of the cheek region through emargination, not through fenestration. And they agreed that the two temporal openings in the tuatara, in crocodiles, and in dinosaurs are the result of fenestration, not of emargination. They both saw the exact same thing when looking at a lizard skull: a reptile skull with an upper temporal opening bounded by an upper temporal arch, below which the cheek region is not covered by bone. Finally, they both asked the same question: how is the lizard skull to be evolutionarily derived from the primitive reptile condition? It is at this juncture where they each read a different evolutionary story into the lizard skull. Baur thought the lower cheek region in lizards that once was covered by bone had become emarginated like in turtles, whereas Cope thought lizards had lost the lower temporal arch, which in ancestral lizards closed off a lower temporal fenestra. In Baur's revised account, lizard skulls shared a feature with turtle skulls, namely the emargination of the lower cheek region from below. In Cope's account, there was nothing that would link turtles to lizards. The two antagonists relied on the same evidence, but they invoked different evolutionary interpretations that implied different hypotheses of turtle relationships.

Baur, who moved to a professorship at the University of Chicago, published a lengthy defense of his views in 1895 in the German journal _Anatomischer Anzeiger_. His defense targeted not only Cope's critique but also that voiced by famous German comparative anatomist Ernst Gaupp (1865–1916), who could "absolutely not follow" Baur's expositions of 1889 (Gaupp, 1895:110n1; on Gaupp, see Fischer, 1917). Gaupp was a student of the enormously influential systematist, comparative anatomist, and phylogeneticist Ernst Haeckel from the University of Jena, and he was also heavily influenced by Haeckel's friend, Carl Gegenbaur (1826–1903), the preeminent comparative anatomist among zoologists of his time (Richards, 2008; Rieppel, 2011). In a lengthy monograph, Gaupp found both lizards and (some) turtles to share the presence of what looks like an upper temporal arch, but unlike Baur, he interpreted the lizard skull the same way as Cope had before, i.e., implying the loss of a lower temporal arch rather than an emargination from below (Gaupp, 1895:115).

Baur, Cope, Gaupp—these were just a few protagonists among many who contributed to these early debates about reptile classification and the relationships of turtles. A contribution, however, that would finally stand the test of time was offered by a former student of Cope's, Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857–1935), with a short note in _Science_ published in 1903 (on Osborn, see Gregory, 1937). At that time, Osborn was a professor at New York's Columbia University and a curator in the department of vertebrate paleontology at the AMNH, where he rose to the post of president in 1908. On the bright side of Osborn's personality shone his preeminence in dinosaur research and dinosaur collection building at the AMNH. The dark side of his personality was committed to eugenics, a pseudoscientific movement that promoted measures to prevent so-called genetically inferior individuals from reproduction, with the goal of improving racial strength, vitality, and superiority. Such a commitment would later culminate in Osborn's enthusiasm for the Hitler–Hindenburg regime; indeed, he expressed hopes for a bright future in Germany that were to be bitterly disappointed.2 In his short 1903 commentary to _Science_ on reptile classification, Osborn referred to a note he had received on February 7, 1903, from the wannabe king of Albania, Viennese paleontologist Franz Baron Nopcsa, informing him of a paper by Broom who, in 1901, had not only divided the reptiles into two major groups on the basis of the differentiation of temporal arches in the dermatocranium, "but also went so far as to assign a phylogenetic value to that distinction" (Osborn, 1903:275).

Robert Broom (1866–1951) was an eccentric Scottish MD with a deep interest in paleontology who was living in South Africa. His medical practice was interrupted for a few years by his appointment, from 1903 through 1909, as professor of geology and zoology at the University of Stellenbosch. His travel abroad took him mainly back to Britain, but he also followed up on an invitation from Osborn to visit the AMNH in 1909 (Watson, 1952; Le Gros Clark, 1951). Although he published on a wide variety of topics in reptile comparative anatomy and phylogeny, Broom specialized on what used to be called mammal-like reptiles from the Karoo region with Permian and Triassic outcrops. The mammal-like reptiles preceded the dinosaurs as the dominant land-dwelling tetrapods and gave rise to mammals before their demise in an Upper Triassic mass extinction event that opened up the opportunity for dinosaurs to rapidly diversify. Broom donated the specimens he collected to the South African Museum of Cape Town, which also appointed him as curator of fossil reptiles. Broom's 1901 monograph—the one Nopcsa alerted Osborn to—dealt with the anatomy and relationships of _Oudenodon_ (spelled _Udenodon_ by Broom), a Late Permian mammal-like reptile from the Karoo, some 260 million years old (Broom, 1901). In discussing the phylogenetic relationships of _Oudenodon_ , Broom again recognized the fully closed temporal region in the dermatocranium as the ancestral condition for reptiles. From that ancestral condition, he derived two main lines of reptile evolution. The first is the mammal-like reptiles that develop a single temporal arch composed of the jugal and squamosal bones, a lineage that would eventually give rise to mammals. The other major line of reptiles is characterized by the development of two temporal arches, Broom argued, neither of which is made up from the same elements of the dermatocranium, as is the single temporal arch characteristic of mammal-like reptiles. In this second line of reptile evolution recognized by Broom, the jugal forms part of the lower temporal arch, and the squamosal forms part of the upper temporal arch. Osborn, who had harbored similar thoughts, followed up on Broom's observations with his 1903 note in _Science_ , adducing additional evidence in support of the division of fossil reptiles into two major evolutionary lineages. The first of Broom's lineage, the one leading to mammals, he called the Synapsida, and the second lineage characterized by two temporal arches he called the Diapsida. Both of these names are still in use today. Significantly, Osborn placed turtles and the marine plesiosaurs into the synapsid lineage, together with mammal-like reptiles, whereas crocodiles, the tuatara, lizards, and snakes he considered part of the diapsid line.

Reptile classification started to take on a modern shape with a landmark publication in 1917. Samuel W. Williston (1851–1918) from the University of Kansas (and later the University of Chicago) was a paleontologist and entomologist who earned his first paleontological accolades on a fossil-hunting expedition for Othniel Charles Marsh. The trip was followed by postgraduate studies at Yale University. Later in life, Williston became a leading vertebrate paleontologist specializing on Mesozoic marine reptiles (Williston, 1914). He was also a member of a committee charged with the task of standardizing the nomenclature for the bones in reptile skulls; he also authored a classic text on the _Osteology of the Reptiles_ , published posthumously by Harvard University Press in 1925. In his 1917 paper, Williston credited Cope for having been the first to have recognized the significance of the temporal arches for the classification of reptiles, but he named Osborn as the one who—with the help of "Dr. J. Howard McGregor"—first followed through on that basis by naming the two major evolutionary lineages of reptiles he recognized, the Synapsida and the Diapsida (Cope, 1871; Osborn, 1903:276). Building on that foundation, Williston recognized two more branches, i.e., evolutionary lineages in the reptile tree, of which only one concerns us here. It is the one that comprises the Paleozoic stem-reptiles in which the temporal region of the dermatocranium is fully closed, a branch Williston called the Anapsida. Together with those ancient stem-reptiles, Williston included turtles within his Anapsida, thus laying down what was to become the classic orthodox view of turtle relationships. In Williston's own words,

It was Baur who first asserted that turtles could not have originated from reptiles with a perforated [i.e., fenestrated] temporal region. Cope derived the order directly from the Cotylosauria.... I approved and emphasized Baur's views in 1904. Case and Hay both hold the same opinion, and only recently Watson has forcibly and convincingly presented the claim of _Eunatosaurus_ [ _sic_ ], from the Permian, as a real connecting link between the two orders. And Broom and others are of the same opinion. This unanimity of opinion renders further discussion superfluous. (1917:420)

A consensus to evolutionarily derive turtles from anapsid stem-reptiles from the Paleozoic may have been hammered out among American paleontologists, with the honorable Davis M. S. Watson (1886–1973) from the University College London on their side, but this consensus definitely did not include Goodrich, who kept the discussion going. Deriving turtles from anapsid stem-reptiles implied that the fully closed temporal region in the skull of those turtles where it occurs is primitive for the group, even if that dermatocranial cover of the cheek region comprises a lesser number of individual elements. Goodrich saw things differently. Reptiles and their fossil relatives, he argued in a paper published in 1916, are not a monophyletic group that can be traced back to a single common ancestor—a single stem species from which they were all descended. Instead, the reptilian assemblage will one day have to be broken up, he said with brilliant foresight, some to be allied with mammals (a lineage he called Theropsida) and others to be allied with birds (a lineage he called Sauropsida). The remaining Paleozoic stem-reptiles with their anapsid skull (i.e., with a completely closed temporal region of the der-matocranium) he sorted into a third group he called the Protosauria. He then went on to criticize the consensus concerning turtle classification that was conjured up by Williston, pointing out that the corresponding classification is based on just a single character complex, namely the differentiation of the dermatocranium in the temporal region of the skull: "Moreover, as is always the case when we endeavor to classify by a single character, we are liable to confuse forms in which foramina [i.e., fenestrae] have begun to appear with others in which they have been or are being secondarily obliterated, and to misinterpret aberrant modifications" (Goodrich, 1916:263). In other words, it was Goodrich's view that the skull alone could not offer a reliable clue to turtle relationships. He thought it was impossible to interpret the closed temporal region of the dermatocranium observed in some turtles—fossil and extant—as either primitive or as a secondary condition (a secondary roofing over) on the basis of a comparison of skull structure alone.

Goodrich, rejecting skull structure as the only relevant character complex for reptile classification, turned his attention to the ankle, which in turtles, the tuatara, crocodiles, and lizards he found to share a certain striking specialization (a hooked fifth metatarsal bone, of which more below), one that he then presented as a character diagnostic of his sauropsidan lineage. The tuatara, crocodiles, and lizards are, of course, classic diapsid reptiles, part of Osborn's Diapsida. Including turtles in his Sauropsida on the basis of the hooked fifth metatarsal, Goodrich implicitly allied the turtles with Osborn's Diapsida. The conclusion thus had to be that in those turtles where the temporal region of the dermatocranium is closed, it was the consequence of a secondary roofing over, not the primitive condition inherited from Paleozoic stem-reptiles.

Between Goodrich's paper of 1916 and Williston's of 1917, most points had been articulated that still dominate the debate on turtle origins and relationships today. Does the complete dermatocranial covering of the temporal region of the skull in those turtles where it occurs represent the primitive condition, or is it the result of a reversal of evolutionary history, i.e., a secondary closure? Are turtles to be derived from Paleozoic anapsid stem-reptiles, perhaps such forms as _Eunotosaurus_ from the late Middle Permian (some 260 million years old) of the Karoo in South Africa, as was argued by H. G. Seeley in 1892, and later—in a much more expanded argument—by D. M. S. Watson in 1914? Or should turtles be allied with diapsid reptiles? (For a critical evaluation of Watson's study, see Parsons and Williams, 1961.) What is the exact embryonic composition of the hooked fifth metatarsal, and viewed from such a developmental perspective, is it indeed the same highly specialized characteristic in the foot of the tuatara, lizards, crocodiles, and turtles? The dilemma concerning turtle relationships was nicely put by Broom in a paper he published in 1924 in memory of Williston. The paper, he announced in a footnote, had already been written in 1919 for a proposed memorial volume honoring Williston—a project that eventually fell through. Then, as now, Broom's statements were valid: "The second group of reptiles which has given rise to trouble is the Chelonia [turtles], and there is no order of reptiles living or extinct concerning whose affinities greater differences of opinion have been expressed" (Broom, 1924:48, cited with permission from the publisher). His lucid diagnosis of the conundrum likewise remains valid today:

The chelonian is manifestly an extremely aberrant type, where the ancestral characters are so obscured by their being intermingled with remarkable specializations that it is very difficult to tell which is which.... Those who regard the structure of the temporal region of the skull as the safest guide to affinity will naturally place the Chelonia with the primitive [anapsid Paleozoic stem-reptiles]; those who hold that more reliance can be placed on the structure of the girdles and limbs will be more impressed with the affinities to primitive diapsids such as _Sphenodon_ [the tuatara]. (Broom, 1924:50, cited with permission from the publisher)

The Cladistic Revolution Captures Turtles

Many of Goodrich's original insights that he published in 1916 have in their essence been vindicated by modern cladistic analysis of reptile relationships. On cladistic principles, the amniotes, i.e., all organisms whose reproduction involves an amniote egg characterized by extraembryonic membranes (i.e., all reptiles, birds and mammals), are subdivided into two major evolutionary lineages, or clades: the Synapsida and the Reptilia, respectively. The Synapsida comprise the so-called mammal-like reptiles of earlier authors and all of their descendants, i.e., the mammals. The Reptilia include the primitive, anapsid Paleozoic stem-reptiles and all of their descendants, including the birds. When fossils are excluded from consideration, the modern concept of Reptilia corresponds to Goodrich's concept of Sauropsida. In other words, if only living organisms are considered, the names Reptilia and Sauropsida are synonymous. Within the Reptilia, the Anapsida is no longer considered a natural (monophyletic) group of common descent (i.e., a group that includes its most recent common ancestor and all, and only, its descendants). Anapsid is today only an anatomic term and no longer a taxonomic one. It no longer denotes an evolutionary lineage but merely refers to the closed temporal region in the dermatocranium that is characteristic of Paleozoic stem-reptiles and some turtles. Instead, the Paleozoic stem-reptiles sort into two major evolutionary lineages, the Parareptilia and the Captorhinomorpha, both thought to be characterized by an anapsid skull (with exceptions among parareptiles).

The parareptiles are a diverse assemblage, including the first herbivores that evolved among tetrapods, the pareiasaurs, mostly large and bulky creatures from the Late Permian of South Africa and Russia. Another parareptilian branch closely related to the pareiasaurs are the procolophonids, relatively small forms with a specialized dentition comprising peglike teeth. The clade first appeared in the Late Permian and diversified in the Early Triassic in the Karoo of South Africa. The Paleozoic (Permian) mesosaurs are aquatic parareptiles, up to about 60 cm (2 feet) long and once thought to be found in continental rather than open marine deposits on both sides of the Atlantic in South Africa and South America. They were historically used as evidence in early discussions of continental drift, as it was thought that their peculiar geographic distribution indicated that the southern continents must at one time have formed a supercontinent known as Gondwana.

The Captorhinomorpha are the second Paleozoic reptile lineage characterized by an anapsid skull. They comprise the classic stem-reptiles, relatively small, land-dwelling, insect-eating animals that diversified during the Permian, some 260 million years ago. They are not themselves the sister group of the parareptiles, however. Instead, the Parareptilia are the sister group of the Eureptilia, the latter representing the major branch of reptile evolution. The Captorhinomorpha are a basal branch in the eureptilian lineage, and as such they constitute the sister group to all remaining reptiles, all of them included in the Diapsida. As a consequence, the Parareptilia and the Captorhinomorpha cannot be grouped together in a monophyletic clade that includes their most recent common ancestor and all, and only, its descendants. The term "Anapsida" thus cannot be used as a taxonomic term but can only stand as an anatomical term, referring to a skull in which the cheek region in the dermatocranium is completely closed. It is perhaps ironic that the anapsid skull has recently been claimed not to represent the primitive condition for the Parareptilia. The most recent analysis showed the most basal parareptiles to have a skull with a lower fenestra in the temporal region of the skull. Within the Parareptilia, this primitive condition was modified in two ways: either the lower temporal arch was lost, which resulted in a ventral embayment of the cheek region, or the lower temporal opening was secondarily closed, which resulted in an anapsid skull (MacDougall and Reisz, 2014). In contrast to the term "Anapsida," the term "Diapsida" can be retained not just as an anatomical term denoting a skull characterized by the presence of two temporal openings but also as a taxonomic term denoting the by far most diversified group of reptiles, one that also includes the birds.

A couple species of early diapsids from the Late Paleozoic (Carboniferous, Permian) form a separate basal branch among the Diapsida, one that constitutes the sister group of the Neodiapsida, or Sauria of some authors, i.e., of those diapsids that have living descendants. The Neodiapsida, or Sauria, divide into two major branches of reptile evolution, the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. The lepidosauromorphs include the tuatara ( _Sphenodon_ ) and the scaly reptiles (the Squamata), which comprise lizards, a group of burrowing lizards called amphisbaenians, and the snakes—and of course their fossil relatives. Although the squamates are a highly diverse group, with nearly 9,000 living species, the diversity of the lepidosauromorph clade still pales in comparison to that of the archosauromorphs. The Archosauromorpha include the crocodiles and their fossil relatives, among which are counted such diverse groups as the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs. Because birds are descended from theropod dinosaurs, they need to be included in the archosauromorphs in order to render the Archosauromorpha a natural group, i.e., a monophyletic clade that includes its most recent common ancestor and all, and only, its descendants. In addition to all the reptile groups just named, there is a host more, such as the marine dolphinlike ichthyosaurs; the sauropterygians; an enigmatic and poorly understood group of marine reptiles, the saurosphargids; and a host of others, none of which matters for the turtle story. In a nutshell, and as of today, turtles have been related—on the basis of cladistic analysis—alternatively to the pareiasaurs or procolophonids among the Parareptilia, but also to the captorhinomorphs among the Paleozoic eureptiles. Turtles have been related along with the Sauropterygia to the lepidosauromorph branch of diapsids, implying a Mesozoic rather than a Paleozoic origin, whereas molecular (DNA) data place them on the archosauromorph branch with the crocodiles and birds. Although sophisticated computer algorithms are being used in the search for turtle sister group relationships, the situation still resembles the one aptly characterized by Broom in the early twentieth century: there is hardly any major reptile group with which turtles have not been at least tentatively allied, even on the basis of cladistic analysis. This is remarkable, as cladistics has been touted to be a nonauthoritarian, objective method with which to reconstruct evolutionary relationships.

The modern understanding—or rather lack thereof—of the evolutionary relationships of turtles with other major branches in the reptile tree started with the work of Eugene S. Gaffney (2013) from the AMNH. Influenced again by Gary Nelson and others, Gaffney was among the first-generation cladists at that institution. In his self-assessment, Gaffney stated, "Although I was an active participant and minor contributor to the Clade Wars of the 1970s, I've never been much of a systematics theoretician" (2013:11). Still, together with Norman I. Platnick from the same institution, he coauthored the influential reviews—mentioned in the previous chapter—of Popper's books on the philosophy of science in _Systematic Zoology_ , thereby adapting through some distortion Popper's characterization of what a true science is, or should be, to cladistic methodology. This was one of the strategies to bolster the claim for superiority of cladistics compared to other schools of biological systematics. But Gaffney is much better known, indeed famous, for his lifelong work on the comparative anatomy and phylogeny of fossil and living turtles: "The first effect of cladism or phylogenetic systematics on turtle taxonomy," Gaffney said, "can be seen in my revision of the Baenidae in 1972" (1984:292). The Baenidae is an extinct family of turtles from the Late Cretaceous of North America, which Gaffney chose to study as part of his PhD project. Whereas most of Gaffney's work focuses on the interrelationships among turtles, he also wrote two papers (Gaffney and McKenna, 1979; Gaffney, 1980) that addressed the broader issue of turtle origins, i.e., the sister group relationships of turtles to other reptiles.

In one of his rare excursions into reptile diversity outside turtles, Gaffney coauthored a description of a Late Permian captorhinid stem-reptile from Rhodesia, some 250 million years old. In their comments on captorhinid systematics, Gaffney and his coauthor obliquely mentioned the possibility that turtles might be closely related to a subgroup of these early anapsid stem-reptiles (Gaffney and McKenna, 1979). The reason for their hesitant comment on turtle relationships was the lack of a well-corroborated analysis of amniote relationships that should have provided the framework for a more rigorous test of potential relations tying turtles to captorhinids. Those higher-level relationships of amniotes Gaffney tackled in a paper that was published the following year, in 1980. Going back to Osborn's distinction of Synapsida and Diapsida, Gaffney framed the problem of turtle relationships in the form of the most basic statement amenable to cladistic analysis, a so-called three-taxon statement (as in the salmon–lungfish–cow debate sketched in the previous chapter). Given three taxa, i.e., the Synapsida (mammals and their fossil relatives), the Diapsida (crocodiles, the tuatara, lizards, and snakes, their fossil relatives, and their descendants), and the turtles, the question becomes, which two taxa among the three are more closely related to each other than either of them is to the third? Given three taxa, there obtain three, and only three, possible answers: the Synapsida is closer to the Diapsida than either is to turtles; the Synapsida is closer to turtles than either is to the Diapsida; or the Diapsida is closer to turtles than either is to the Synapsida. Primarily on the basis of characteristics that relate to the structure of the nose, Gaffney opted for the first of these three alternatives. Much later, Gaffney reiterated more explicitly his hypothesis of a sister group relationship between captorhinid stem-reptiles and turtles, summarizing new evidence in support of a "refined Anapsida that is not very different from its initial formulation by Williston (1925)" (Gaffney and Meylan, 1988:160). At the time of his writing, the Parareptilia had not yet been recognized as a natural, i.e., monophyletic, group, with the consequence that Gaffney could continue to use the term "Anapsida" as a taxonomic name, just like Williston had done.

The first signal for the existence of a parareptilian clade was picked up and published in the same edited volume that also contained Gaff-ney's paper on turtle phylogeny (Gauthier, Kluge, and Rowe, 1988). The authors of the relevant chapter were not convinced, however, that the Parareptilia their analysis had recovered was a well-supported monophyletic clade, one that includes its most recent ancestor and all, and only, its descendants. A group that includes the ancestor and only some of its descendants is called paraphyletic in cladistic jargon—hence the name Parareptilia. But the possibility of the existence of a parareptilian clade was still put out there for others to confirm or reject through additional research. The monophyly of Parareptilia was indeed tested, and confirmed, seven years later, in a paper published in 1995 by Michel Laurin and his doctoral supervisor, Robert Reisz, from the University of Toronto. Already in January 1991 these two authors had made headlines with a paper published in _Nature_ in which they described the oldest known procolophonid, _Owenetta_ from the Late Permian of the Karoo, Broom's old hunting grounds in South Africa. That in itself was perhaps not overly exciting, but the authors used the insights they had gained through the study of _Owenetta_ to argue that turtles were in fact related to, and hence ultimately descended from, procolophonids, a subgroup of the Parareptilia (Reisz and Laurin, 1991). _Owenetta_ was to be recognized as close to the ancestry of turtles. At the time, this idea was both new and revolutionary. "The tale the mock turtle tells in _Alice in Wonderland_ is obscure and incomplete, so we are unsure whether certain fossils are mock ancestors or true ancestors," noted one commentator (Fraser, 1991:278). But in their more comprehensive 1995 study, Laurin and Reisz reaffirmed their position on the basis of a large-scale cladistic analysis of amniote interrelationships that robustly supported a procolophonid–turtle relationship within the monophyletic Parareptilia. Among the many features—mostly subtle characteristics of skull structure—that the authors found turtles to share with _Owenetta_ , as also with other procolophonids, was the funnel-shaped configuration of the bone located at the back end of the skull (the quadrate) that supports the tympanic membrane, and from which the lower jaw is suspended. Laurin and Reisz grouped the procolophonids and turtles together under the name "testudinomorphs," finding the pareiasaurs to be the sister group of the latter clade within the parareptiles, again robustly supported by cladistic analysis.

The hypothesis of a procolophonid–turtle sister group relationship would not stand unchallenged for long, however. Michael S. Y. Lee, then a graduate student at the University of Cambridge, in 1993 published a paper in _Science_ titled "The Origin of the Turtle Body Plan: Bridging a Famous Morphological Gap." The gap invoked here refers to the radically different body plan of a turtle, most distinctly characterized by the shell, which separates the turtles from other reptiles with a more generalized tetrapod appearance. Lee argued that turtles are the sister group to the pareiasaurs (Pareiasauridae), not the procolophonids, both nested within the parareptiles. With his hypothesis, Lee revived, on the basis of a comprehensive cladistic analysis, a hypothesis that had first been issued by Gregory in a classic 1946 paper. William K. Gregory (1876–1970) was a graduate student of Osborn's at the AMNH and Columbia University in New York, two institutions at which Gregory would himself pursue a highly successful career as curator and professor, respectively (Colbert, 1975). It was Gregory who arranged the posthumous publication of Williston's landmark _Osteology of the Reptiles_ by Harvard University Press in 1925. He would later go on to publish his own books, one of his most famous being _Evolution Emerging—A Survey of Changing Patterns from Primeval Life to Man_ that appeared in 1951. His work on the evolution of humans led him to publish on the infamous fossil hoax, the Piltdown Man, allegedly collected in the Weald of Sussex, England. The "fossil" remains were described in 1913 and named _Eoanthropus dawsoni_ by Arthur Smith Woodward (1864–1944), in honor of its supposed discoverer, Charles Dawson (Smith Woodward, 1913:137). Woodward, an expert on fossil fishes at the British Museum (Natural History), did not recognize the fossil as a fake. In contrast, Gregory in 1916 confirmed other critics' opinion that at least the mandible is that of a modern chimpanzee, not that of an ancestral fossil human. But in 1946, his interest focused not on the origin of humans but of turtles.

Before arguing his case that pareiasaurs should be considered the ancestors of turtles, Gregory commented on alternative theories that had been proposed earlier. He opened his review of turtle origins with reference to two authors who had derived turtles from sauropterygians—more precisely, from placodonts. The latter are a group of marine reptiles of diapsid affinities, which first appeared in the fossil record some 245 million years ago in marine Triassic deposits near Winterswijk in the Netherlands (Neenan, Klein, and Scheyer, 2013). The group, known from central European, circum-Mediterranean, and Chinese localities, persisted into the latest Triassic in the Southern Alps. As indicated by their name, the placodonts' trademark is the platelike crushing teeth in the upper and lower jaws, which they used in pursuit of hard-shelled invertebrate prey such as bivalves, cephalopods, and crustaceans. The greatest diversity and evolutionary longevity within the group was achieved by the armored placodonts, which developed a complex protective armor composed of dermal ossifications, known as osteoderms (bony plates that ossify directly in the deep layer of the skin, the dermis). All armored placodonts developed a bony shield covering the back of the animal known as a carapace; some added a tail shield that covered the pelvic region and part of the tail; others still added belly armor, known as a plastron.

Superficially, the body armor of some of these placodonts strikingly resembles that of turtles. But German paleontologist Otto Jaekel (1863–1929) thought he had found, in addition, a great many resemblances in the skull of turtles and that of an armored placodont he was describing, and he consequently concluded that turtles are descended from armored placodonts. Jaekel was a graduate of the University of Breslau; after stints at the universities of Munich, Strasbourg, and Berlin, in 1906, he was named professor of geology and paleontology at the University of Greifswald. His major claim to fame was his excavation of the Late Triassic dinosaur _Plateosaurus_ from the Halberstadt locality near Berlin. It was during these excavations, which lasted from 1909 through 1911, that Jaekel also found new specimens of the extremely rare _Proganochelys_ , then the oldest known fossil turtle. In the aftermath of these activities, Jaekel was in 1927 accused of all sort of misdeeds in the _Völkischer Beobachter_ , the main publicist outlet of Hitler's National Socialist German Worker's Party (NSDAP). He had allegedly flown the Communist red flag from his window while pursuing fieldwork in Halberstadt, and he sold dinosaur bones for personal profit. Jaekel thereupon wrote a stern letter to "Sehr geehrter Herr Hitler!" as well as to the editor of the journal, threatening legal action if these allegations were not withdrawn: "Unless you publish in your journal a full rectification, I shall find myself forced to hand over the entire affair to the state attorney." It was still possible in 1927 to address Hitler in such a tone. Jaekel eventually prevailed and had the informer as well as the managing editor of the piece incriminating him convicted of libel.3

Long before he got embroiled in such disputes, Jaekel published in 1907 a beautiful monograph of a newly discovered armored placodont, one he named _Placochelys placodonta_ (Jaekel, 1902a, 1907). The specimen came from the Late Triassic (Carnian, some 230 million years old) of the Bakony Mountains overlooking Lake Balaton, collected at a locality near the city of Veszprém in what was then Habsburg Austria-Hungary. In a preliminary note (1902a), he had already announced the find, named the species, and claimed it to be an ancestor of turtles. The hypothesis that this placodont is close to the ancestry of turtles is what gave the species its name, _Placochelys placodonta_ , which translates to "turtlelike placodont with crushing teeth." When he later described the fossil turtles he had himself collected in the Late Triassic deposits of Halberstadt, Jaekel radically changed his views about turtle relationships; the fossils, he stated, "clearly prove that turtles have nothing to do with reptiles, but instead are close to the Paratheria, and hence close to the origin of mammals" (1918:213ff.).

In his memoir _On the Classification of the Reptiles_ commemorating Williston, written in 1919 but published in 1924, Broom had voiced a similar opinion (independent of Jaekel, as Gregory concluded), namely that turtles are to be derived from placodonts. According to Broom, "At first sight, the skull [of placodonts] looks very unlike that of a chelonian, but, on a more careful examination, there are seen to be some striking similarities" (Broom, 1924:53). However, in reviewing these earlier propositions, Gregory found such striking similarities to lie elsewhere: "When I turned my attention to the pareiasaurs... they seemed on the whole to afford an excellent starting point for the chelonian line, both in their general construction and in many features of the skull, vertebrae, ribs, girdles, limb bones, hands and feet" (1946:282).

In 1996, Michael S. Y. Lee—now at the University of Sydney—further elaborated on the idea of a pareiasaur–turtle relationship, this time in _Nature_. But in this paper, Lee went much further in his expositions on turtle origins than Gregory had done, or than he himself had done in his 1993 paper. No longer content to merely state relative degrees of phylogenetic relationships as they are recovered through cladistic analysis and represented by a bifurcating cladogram, he now developed what is known as an evolutionary scenario. Using the cladogram as a scaffold, he hung on it a scenario as to how an early, primitive (anapsid) stem-reptile could have evolved and transformed in such a way as to become a pareiasaur first, then a turtle through further evolutionary transformation. "Turtles exhibit some of the most extreme postcranial modifications in vertebrates," Lee wrote. "Our understanding of chelonian origins has been restricted by a paucity of information on intermediate forms" (1996:812). What this says is that a wide anatomical gap separates turtles from ordinary tetrapods such as lizards, and that in the absence of intermediate forms, it is difficult to imagine how evolutionary transformation resulted in such an aberrant body plan as the turtle's. In his reappraisal of turtle origins, however, Lee set out to "show that certain pareiasaurs—dwarf, heavily armored forms such a [ _sic_ ] _Nanoparia_ —approach the chelonian morphology [i.e., anatomy] even more closely than previously thought" (1996:812; see also Lee, 1997). However, to go from a stem-reptile to a large pareiasaur, and from there to a dwarf, heavily armored pareiasaur, and from there to turtles in terms of a continuous series of evolutionary transformations, landed Lee in a conundrum: are the pareiasaurs (i.e., members of the family Pareiasauridae) as a whole the sister group to turtles, or is a dwarf, armored pareiasaur species the sister group to turtles? In the latter case, turtles would not be the sister group of pareiasaurs but instead would be nested within the pareiasaur tree. With respect to the latter hypothesis, Lee recognized "conflicting evidence suggesting that pareiasaurs are the monophyletic sister group of turtles" (1996:812). Lee thus had two conflicting hypotheses. Cladistic analysis showed turtles to be the sister group of pareiasaurs as a whole. His evolutionary scenario placed turtles inside the pareiasaurs as a descendant of a specialized, dwarfed, heavily armored pareiasaur species. This is a typical case of conflict between cladistic thinking and classic evolutionary thinking. Cladistic thinking moves in terms of sister group relationships, whereas evolutionary thinking moves in terms of ancestors and descendants. The "bridging [of] a famous morphological gap" that separates turtles from other tetrapods through a series of intermediate forms that stand in an ancestor–descendant relationship to one another stands in direct conflict with cladistic methodology that sorts organisms into a nested hierarchy of sister groups (Lee, 1993:1716).

In bridging the gap between cladistic thinking and evolutionary thinking, Lee adopted the classical, i.e., Darwinian, model of evolutionary change as a process of gradual, steady evolutionary transformation in small, successive steps, as is implied by the twin mechanisms identified by Darwin. Variation, in ever so slight degrees, and natural selection must result in an evolutionary transformation of organisms that occurs in small steps, one after the other, such that all intermediate conditions of form must be realized through time. There cannot be, under this transformationist paradigm, any abrupt, saltational evolutionary change that leaves a morphological gap between the ancestral and decendant conditions of form. A second, theoretical conception of evolutionary change adopted by Lee was that of a correlated progression in evolutionary transformation. This is "the idea that evolutionary changes in one feature of the organism allow changes to take place in some other traits, changes which in turn influence the further evolution of the original feature. These feedbacks and interactions mean that the different organs appear to coevolve with each other" (Lee, 1996:814).

The concept of correlated progression threatens to place an enormous metaphysical burden on evolutionary scenarios, as will be discussed in more detail later, in the context of a historical review of theories of saltational evolution. Suffice it to say at this juncture that the concept of correlated progression could be interpreted to imply progression toward something—toward some sort of goal, such as, for example, the turtle body plan. Could there be a goal directedness in the evolution of the turtle shell? If there is, what would be the mechanism of such directed evolutionary transformation? What would be a natural mechanism that would guide a whole series of successive steps of evolutionary transformation unerringly toward a life in a shell?4 For Darwin himself, the evolutionary process was progressive. He wrote: "And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporal and mental endowments will tend to progress toward perfection" (1859:489). But modern Darwinian theory, with its mathematical models explaining the working of random variation and natural election, forcefully denies any possibility of a goal directedness of evolutionary processes. Second, the concept of correlated progression requires the coevolution of organs or organ complexes, the latter evolving in tandem in a process of evolutionary transformation that is guided by some hypothetical system of feedback loops. But what exactly are the developmental (ontogenetic) or evolutionary (phylogenetic) mechanisms that constitute these feedback loops? How would the development and evolution of the turtle shell guide the development and evolution of the limbs and their girdles, and vice versa? How would the development and evolution of a rigid turtle shell trigger correlated changes in the development and evolution of new mechanisms of respiration, and vice versa? Those are some of the questions that will have to be addressed in a discussion of the evolution of the turtle shell. This will also be the context in which to return to a discussion of Lee's scenario of correlated progression in the evolution of turtles.

Let us return to the original project in this chapter, which is to achieve an understanding of reptile classification that would hint at the turtles' place in the reptile tree of life. In the mid-1990s, two competing hypotheses derived turtles from two different groups of Paleozoic parareptiles: procolophonids versus pareiasaurs. None of the analyses that had generated these results included any reptiles, fossil or living, from times beyond the Paleozoic, other than turtles, of course. If diapsids were included at all, as in the Laurin and Reisz analysis, they were very basal forms from the Late Paleozoic, some 310 to 250 million years old. The decision to restrict the analysis of turtle relationships to a comparison with reptiles from the Paleozoic only was rooted in the firm conviction that turtles are living fossils, an ancient branch of reptile evolution whose origin reaches all the way back to the earliest stem-reptiles. The same conviction was also implicit in Gaffney's proposal, which linked turtles with Paleozoic captorhinomorphs. Goodrich's call for caution and circumspection had faded over time.

This is where the study that I conducted with Michael deBraga fundamentally differed: we included in our analysis of turtle relationships a host of Paleozoic synapsids as well as parareptiles, plus eureptiles ranging from the Paleozoic captorhinomorphs all the way up to living forms. Those newly added groups of reptiles from the Mesozoic to modern times created a pull that shifted turtle origins from the Paleozoic into the Triassic, which made a lot of sense. The robust bony remains of turtles, especially the shell, should stand a good chance of fossilization, at least in terms of bits and pieces. Given that the first undisputed fossil turtles come from the Late Triassic, the origin of turtles from Paleozoic procolophonids or pareiasaurs would leave the turtle lineage undocumented in the fossil record for maximally 80 million years and minimally 40 million years—a ghost lineage of remarkable duration. In our analysis, turtles came out as the sister group of sauropterygians, which themselves make their first appearance in the fossil record in the late Early Triassic. This significantly reduces the ghost lineage for turtles. The ghost lineage for turtles might be even more reduced if a controversial fragmentary fossil some 240 million years old, from the Middle Triassic Muschelkalk of Germany, was indeed a turtle.

This fragment of a carapace was collected in 1969 in an abandoned quarry near Hegnabrunn in Bavaria. It was preliminarily identified as a turtle by the curator of fossil reptiles at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Rupert Wild, and formally described by its collector, Hans-Volker Karl, under the name _Priscochelys hegnabrunnensis_ in 2005. Because the German Muschelkalk also harbors placodonts, including armored placodonts of the genus _Cyamodus_ , a controversy soon emerged whether the carapace fragment called _Priscochelys_ indeed represents a turtle (it would have been the oldest one then known) or whether it instead represents the remains of an armored placodont. One expert opinion, based on anatomical considerations, confirmed the chelonian nature of the fossil; another expert opinion, based on microstructural analysis of the bone, identified the carapace fragment as one of a cyamodontoid placodont (Joyce and Karl, 2006; Scheyer, 2008). The (surprisingly) rare carapace fragments from the Muschelkalk of Germany that have been unequivocally assigned to cyamodontoid placodonts look different from _Priscochelys_ , however, rendering the latter's chelonian nature more plausible. At the end of the day, the specimen is too incomplete to significantly contribute to the discussions of turtle origins; its importance lies more in fixing the time of the first appearance of turtles in the fossil record, if indeed it does.

Be that as it may, the debate surrounding this carapace fragment shows how similar the body armor in turtles and cyamodontoid plac-odonts can be perceived—an issue that will have to be revisited in the discussion of the evolution of the turtle shell. In our analysis, however, turtles did not come out as the sister group to placodonts, or cyamodontoid placodonts, as had been argued by Jaekel and Broom, but as the sister group of Sauropterygia as a whole. This result implies an independent, i.e., convergent, evolution of body armor in turtles and placodonts. Turtles and sauropterygians thus together form an evolutionary lineage, or clade, that in our analysis is linked to the lepidosauromorph branch of reptiles, one that also includes the tuatara, the squamates (lizards, amphisbaenians, and snakes), and their more immediate fossil relatives. Such a position of turtles on the reptile tree implies, however, that turtles are diapsid reptiles—much more modern in their origins than if they had been descended from Paleozoic parareptiles. That result also implies that the complete dermatocranial roofing of the temporal region of the skull is secondary in those turtles where it occurs, mimicking the ancestral condition of reptiles rather than representing it, just as Goodrich had argued.

The publication of our results triggered a flurry of investigations into turtle relationships, based both on anatomical comparison and molecular, mostly DNA, data. DNA can, of course, not be retrieved from Mesozoic fossils—at least not outside Hollywood; molecular studies had to restrict the analysis of turtle relationships to living forms. Here again we get a classic three-taxon statement concerning the turtle, the lizard, and the crocodile, although most studies threw in a bird as well. If the turtle is not a diapsid reptile but has to be derived from Paleozoic stem-reptiles, then the DNA data should show the crocodiles (and birds, if included) to be more closely related to lizards than either of those is to turtles. If, on the other hand, the DNA data show the turtles to be more closely related to lizards than to crocodiles, our result based on anatomical characteristics would have been confirmed by molecular data. What the great majority of the molecular studies showed instead is that turtles are more closely related to crocodiles (and birds, if included) than to lizards. In contrast to our own studies, most molecular analyses thus link turtles to the archosauromorph branch of reptile evolution, although still within diapsids.

Since the late 1990s, the controversial relationships of turtles have spawned a large body of literature that needs not be reviewed here. Suffice it to say that investigations based on a comparative anatomical approach strongly, but not exclusively, favor a lepidosauromorph relationship of turtles within diapsids, rendering the tuatara, lizards, and snakes the closest relatives of turtles among living reptiles. Molecular studies overwhelmingly, but not exclusively, support an archosauromorph relationship of turtles within diapsids reptiles, rendering the crocodiles and birds the closest relatives of turtles among living reptiles. Most recently, molecular analyses of turtle relationships have been expanded to a genomic scale, with masses of data overwhelmingly supporting archosauromorph relations of turtles (Crawford et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). This is not to say that such a conclusion has been generally accepted today. There is an obvious discrepancy in the signals concerning turtle relationships generated by comparative anatomical versus molecular studies—a discrepancy that still has no satisfactory explication today. There is a general tendency among contemporary systematists to proclaim the supremacy of the molecular data over anatomical ones, and thus to anchor the truth about the phylogenetic relationships of turtles in their genetic code. Rather than seeking a truth that may not be at arm's length of science, however, it would seem more interesting to investigate why it is that comparative anatomical, as opposed to genomic, approaches yield such disparate results concerning turtle relationships with lepidosaurs or archosaurs, respectively. Unfortunately, that conversation is largely eschewed in favor of arguments about the superiority of one method over another. In addition, there are still some paleontologists who argue that turtles are in fact not diapsids but rather must be derived from some Paleozoic stem-reptile, procolophonian, pareiasaurian, or otherwise.

Language Games

Many people think that science is all about observation and measurement. Indeed, figuring out the evolutionary relationships between organisms starts with observation in some form or other—direct observation in the case of comparative anatomical studies, indirect observation in the case of the alignment of strands of DNA in search of a phylogenetic signal. What is perhaps less well understood is the fact that science is not just about observation but is also about the way scientists talk about their observations. There is a reality of facts based on tangible objects, but there is also a reality that emerges from dialogue, as every lawyer or diplomat well knows. Popper famously argued that there is no such thing as raw, theory-free observation. Another philosopher, Norwood R. Hanson (1958), put that insight to work in an enlightening example. Imagine a patient sitting across the doctor's desk. The day before, an X-ray tube had expired, which the doctor had put on his desk so he would not forget to order a replacement. Utterly ignorant of X-ray technology, the patient looks at this strange object on the doctor's desk, wondering what it is. Hanson argued that at this moment, the doctor and the patient both see the same thing, yet they see the same thing differently. Given his background knowledge, the doctor sees the expired X-ray tube for what it is, such that he might worry about the cost of replacement. The patient, in contrast, sees the object as something in need of an explanation. It is only after having heard and understood the doctor's explanation that both doctor and patient see the same thing: see the expired X-ray tube for what it is. To merely see an object is thus not the same as to see an object while understanding what it actually is.

Popper was certainly right when he claimed that every one of us, scientists included, approaches the world around us in light of previous experiences, insights, hopes, and fears—in short, in light of our background knowledge. Every observation reported by scientists is thus prone to be tainted by background knowledge in their field, i.e., by beliefs and expectations that derive from theories that scientists hope to confirm or refute. As a consequence of this insight, one that today is generally accepted among philosophers of science, Popper compared the scientific community to a jury in court. It is this jury, i.e., the community of scientists that shares common research interests, that decides whether any given report on observations should be accepted or rejected. But that puts scientists in a position of having to advocate for their observational reports in as convincing a manner as possible, just as lawyers try to argue as convincingly as possible in defense of their clients. If that is the case, then the reality as pictured by science is constituted not just and only by the observable furniture of the world, but also, in some part at least, by language and the way it is used by scientists in the description of the furniture of the world. The concept of language games was developed by Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951), likely the most influential philosopher of the twentieth century. The concept is concerned with the way in which the words that comprise language acquire meaning through their use in relation to actions rather than through precise definitions. Another philosopher, Nelson Goodman (1906–1998), spoke of the entrenchment that secures the meaning of predicates through language use. Again, predicates such as "blue" or "green" acquire their meaning through repeated use with reference to objects of the respective color, not through precise definition. Such philosophical perspectives would seem to interfere with the objective of scientists who seek to provide as precise a definition as possible for the terms used to report on scientific findings.

It is a fact rooted in observation that most land-dwelling animals with a backbone share four limbs that come in two pairs. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as limbless salamanders and snakes.) It is not an observation but a conjecture, albeit one that can be substantiated with reference to fossils, that land-dwelling vertebrates inherited four limbs that come in two pairs from a common ancestor. By virtue of them generally having four limbs, the land-dwelling vertebrates are called tetrapods (Tetrapoda). Conversely, the tetrapod limbs have been recognized as a key character of Tetrapoda, hinting at a common evolutionary origin for all tetrapods. The conclusion is that the tetrapod limbs originated only once, namely in the most recent common ancestor of all tetrapods. The limbs of tetrapods can serve vastly different functions, and hence they can differ profoundly in shape, such as the wings of birds and the forelimbs of horses, bats, and moles, but the bird wing can easily be recognized as an evolutionary transformation and specialization of the primitive tetrapod limb, and the same is true for the forelimb of a horse, bat, or mole. The bird wing is the same but different as the forelimb of a mole: birds modified the tetrapod limb in an adaptation to flight, whereas moles modified the tetrapod limb in an adaptation to burrowing. This example illuminates the fundamental scheme that underlies all efforts to decipher evolutionary relationships on the basis of comparative anatomy. First there is the recognition that all tetrapods—some exceptions not withstanding—share four limbs that come in two pairs, anterior and posterior. This correspondence reveals the limbs to be homologous throughout all tetrapods. Homology here means a structural correspondence that is revealed by anatomical comparison, which is explained by a common evolutionary origin. Of limbless tetrapods such as snakes, we consequently do not say that they have no limbs; instead, we say that they have lost limbs (Platnick, 1978). Second, calling limbs homologous throughout Tetrapoda carries an important evolutionary connotation: homologues are corresponding parts of two or more organisms that enter into a relation called homology, and homology is defined as a structural correspondence due to common ancestry (Brigandt, 2002). If the limbs are said to be homologous throughout tetrapods, the evolutionary implication is that tetrapods share a common evolutionary origin, i.e., they share a common ancestor from which they inherited the developmental pathway that, if it plays out to completion, results in four limbs that come in two pairs.

Homologues are namesakes. Homologous parts in two or more organisms are called by the same name. The heart is homologous throughout vertebrates; it is the same but different in different species of vertebrates. The heart of a fish has two chambers and the heart of a mammal has four chambers, but is still called by the same name in both. Names, however, are difficult to deal with—so much so that careful unpacking of that issue is necessary. The man who introduced the term "homologue" was Sir Richard Owen (1804–1892), at the time Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in London. In that capacity, he published in 1843 his _Lectures on the Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Invertebrate Animals_ , a book to which he appended a glossary in which he introduced the term "homologue," from "(Gr[eek] _homos; logos_ , speech)," defining it as "the same organ in different animals under every variety of form and function" (1843:379). Writing in 1843, he did not link homology to common ancestry but only to structural correspondence. The link between homology and evolution was left for Darwin to discover. Lecturing on the anatomy of vertebrate animals later in life, a time when he served as superintendent of the natural history section of the British Museum, Owen modified his definition: "A 'homologue' is a part or organ in one organism so answering to that in another as to require the same name" (1866:xii). The "skull" is such a name, as are the "tetrapod limb" or "heart." We freely use the name "skull" to pick out the anterior part of the vertebrate axial skeleton, the bony structure that sits on the anterior end of the vertebral column, that encapsulates the brain and major sense organs, and that carries the jaws in both salmon and mammal, even though the skull in salmon and mammals differs widely in shape and function. The skull is the same in salmon and mammals because of its common evolutionary origin, but it is different in shape and function because it had a different evolutionary history in salmon and mammals.

The skull has played an important part in reptile classification: emargination (in turtles) versus fenestration (in diapsids) of the cheek region of the dermatocranium, the formation or loss of an upper and lower temporal arch, and so on. "Dermatocranium," "upper temporal arch"—these are names picking out homologues, the relevance of which lies in the fact that today, in a world after Darwin, we define homology as structural correspondence due to common ancestry. Homologues are namesakes, i.e., called by the same name. The temporal region of the dermatocranium is the same in all reptiles but different because it was affected by different modifications in the course of the evolutionary history of different lineages of reptile phylogeny. Fenestration, the formation of temporal fenestrae, characterizes diapsid reptiles, whereas the cheek region in turtles is subject to emargination. The upper temporal arch, forming as a consequence of fenestration, is homologous in crocodiles, dinosaurs, the tuatara, and those lizards that retain it. What looks like an upper temporal arch in some turtles with a deeply emarginated cheek region is not a true temporal arch because it results from a different developmental and evolutionary process. The term "upper temporal arch" thus cannot be used as a label in the description of (some) turtle skulls. Conversely, if the name were used for (some) turtles, it would also carry certain evolutionary, i.e., phylogenetic, implications, namely that turtles and diapsid reptiles derive from a common ancestor from which they inherited the upper temporal arch. However, Goodrich did not ascribe an upper temporal arch to turtles when proposing them to be related to diapsids; instead, one of the characters he based his argument on concerned a bone in the foot, the fifth metatarsal, the bone that in humans supports the pinky toe.

The crux of all classification, to the extent that it should represent the evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships among the organisms classified, is to identify the right homologies—that is, to identify those structural correspondences between two or more organisms that provide a key to their evolutionary past, which are indicative of their common ancestry. When Goodrich asserted that the peculiarly bent, indeed hooked, structure of the enlarged fifth metatarsal, as observed in turtles, crocodiles, the tuatara, and lizards, is suggestive of a homology of the hooked fifth metatarsal in diapsid reptiles and turtles, he was in effect saying that the hooked fifth metatarsal is of common evolutionary origin in diapsid reptiles and turtles. In other words, diapsids and turtles share a common ancestor from which they inherited the hooked fifth metatarsal. If diapsid reptiles are to be a monophyletic, i.e., a natural group that includes its most recent common ancestor and all, and only, its descendants, then on the basis of that argument, turtles must be classified with diapsid reptiles, not with anapsid stem-reptiles. It is the same but different: the same name (hooked fifth metatarsal) applies to the homologous structures in the foot of turtles and diapsid reptiles, even though the details of articulation in the foot may be different in crocodiles as opposed to lizards or turtles.

A name functions like a tag; it picks out things of the outer world and signifies those things in language, including scientific discourse. However, it is one thing to pick out and tag an organism through baptism, thus bestowing a proper name on that organism, such as Bill Clinton. No ambiguities obtain here. Bill Clinton did in fact become the 42nd president of the United States, but it could have been possible (at least, and however unlikely, it would not have been in principle impossible) for Bill Clinton to become a saxophone player with the Rolling Stones. No matter; the name "Bill Clinton" always picks out the same individual, whatever that individual is doing (again, the notion of the same but different). This is how proper names function, although it is a function that requires the persistence of the self-identity of the individual named from the time the egg cell is fertilized until the time of death. It is quite clearly another thing, however, to claim that the name "hooked fifth metatarsal" picks out the same thing in the foot of a crocodile, a lizard, and a turtle, especially if these same things may differ in detail as a consequence of their evolutionary history. For many authors, the "same but different" that characterizes homologues implies identity of these homologues—in our example, the identity of the hooked fifth metatarsal in turtles, lizards, and crocs, an identity that is rooted in the unique evolutionary origin of the hooked fifth metatarsal in the most recent ancestor of turtles, crocodiles, and lizards.

A prerequisite for all classifications that are meant to represent evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships is certainly the correct identification of homologies. That depends on the one hand on a comparative method that allows us to pinpoint corresponding parts, or organs, in two or more organisms that could be homologous. Beyond that, however, homology implies common ancestry, and in the absence of a time machine, the latter implication cannot be confirmed through observation. The relation of homology therefore does not obtain from raw observation alone. Instead, while ultimately rooted in a comparative analysis of anatomy, it nevertheless remains to a large degree a hypothetical relation. That opens up space—philosopher Willard Quine (1908–2000) called it "empirical slack" (1951:179)—for different applications of names as we talk about homologues and the implied relation of common ancestry. Philosopher of biology John Griffiths used the concept of entrenchment (in Nelson Goodman's sense) in relation to the terms that pick out homologues (Griffiths, 2007:653). The meaning of the terms "skull," heart," and "tetrapod limbs," as homologues of vertebrates and tetrapods, respectively, is fixed by the repeated, successful deployment of these terms in the search for evolutionary relationships. It would thus seem to be possible for an evolutionary biologists to break out of such entrenchment by dropping an entrenched term and introducing a new, different one.

If we say, "Turtles, crocodiles, and lizards share a hooked fifth metatarsal," homology is implied, and with it the hypothesis that they all share a common ancestor from which they inherited the hooked fifth metatarsal. However, if we say, "Turtles have a turtle-type hooked fifth metatarsal, crocodiles have a crocodile-type hooked fifth metatarsal, and lizards have a lizard-type hooked fifth metatarsal," no homology, and hence no common ancestry of turtles, crocodiles, and lizards, is implied. But we can go even further by dropping a name and replacing it with a different one. That way, identities of homologues are first withdrawn when a name is dropped; then new identities of alternative homologues are established when a new name is introduced.

The cladistic analyses of turtle relationships sketched above made use of an ever-increasing number of characters in search for homologies. A quantum leap in the number of characters used occurred when cladistic analysis shifted from the comparative anatomical approach to the use of DNA data. Another quantum leap occurred when the analyses shifted from genetic to genomic data, where it is not just select strands of DNA but rather the complete DNA within a single cell of an organism that is used in phylogeny reconstruction. Other than in extremely exceptional cases, a paleontologist has nothing but fossilized bones to compare, often incompletely preserved ones. In terms of numbers of characters used, fossils can certainly provide no match to counter molecular, especially genomic, analyses of turtle relationships. What to do, then, if you are a paleontologist whose background intuition it is that Paleozoic stem-reptiles may be a far better match for turtle ancestry than any of the diapsid reptile lineages, and who hence tends to disagree with the results of molecular analyses that place turtles with crocodiles on the archosauromorph branch of the reptile tree? How could paleontologists set about to test such placement of turtles on the basis of DNA data? The "hooked fifth metatarsal" is an entrenched name for a structure considered by Goodrich as homologous in turtles and diapsid reptiles, and as such, it carries an important evolutionary connotation. But that connotation, i.e., a common evolutionary origin of turtles and diapsid reptiles, is exactly the one that is to be subjected to a test. One strategy would seem to be to break out of such entrenchment by changing the language, and with it the names of homologues embedded in it. In an attempt to avoid preconceived (entrenched) theoretical commitments, the removal of the name tag from the structure under discussion removes its putative identity, whereas the introduction of new names that imply different evolutionary histories, and hence different phylogenetic relationships, establishes new identities of different homologues. This is what happened in the discussion of the hooked fifth metatarsal of turtles and diapsids. Critics of the diapsid affinities of turtles removed the name and with it the identity of the structure under consideration, disassembled the structure into constituent parts, and put those back together again differently in turtles and diapsids.

When Goodrich (1916) pondered the possible homology of the hooked fifth metatarsal in turtles and diapsid reptiles, he referred back to earlier authors who, like him, had attempted to disentangle the evolutionary history of that curious bone. In particular, the hooked fifth metatarsal (call it mt5) appears distinctly enlarged, encroaching into space that in other reptiles is occupied by a neighboring element, the fifth distal tarsal (call it x), a small bone that sits at the base of the fifth digit (toe). Goodrich then proceeded to list all possible alternative interpretations of the hooked fifth metatarsal: (1) mt5 is just mt5 but has expanded into the territory primitively occupied by x, and x has been lost in lizards, crocs, and turtles; (2) mt5 has been lost in lizards, crocs, and turtles, and x has expanded to mimic mt5; and (3) mt5 has fused with x in lizards, crocs, and turtles. Goodrich settled on the first alternative on the basis of "Sewertzoff's excellent account" of tetrapod limb development (1916:264). There is an important distinction here to be drawn, however, as was indeed highlighted in Sewertzoff's excellent account. Historically there have been two fundamentally different ways to look at and understand animal development in general: atomistic and epigenetic. The atomistic point of view sees animal development as a coming together of originally separate parts. Just as atoms come together to form molecules, so would parts come together to form an organism during embryonic development. On an atomistic account, the third alternative above would imply that mt5 has fused with x in the course of evolution of the lizard, croc, and turtle foot: two originally separate elements would have fused to form one. The epigenetic perspective, in contrast, sees animal development as the development of one part from and out of the other. In other words, one part is giving rise to one or more other parts through a process of growth and division. On that account, blood vessels do not join the heart during development but instead grow out from the heart. In his account of the embryonic development of the foot in a gecko lizard, Sewertzoff had found that, in contrast to the fourth metatarsal at the base of the fourth digit, the metatarsal supporting the fifth digit never gives rise to a separate element x (Sewertzoff, 1908:130). He thus interpreted the development of the gecko foot from an epigenetic perspective. Indeed, modern analyses of limb development have shown that most elements in the hands and feet of tetrapods—with the notable exception of the elements in the fifth digit—develop from one another in a process that involves growth, bifurcation, and subdivision of cartilaginous rudiments (Shubin and Alberch, 1986).

This contrasts with a recent account of the embryonic development of mt5 in turtles, which concludes that mt5 fuses with x during embryonic development. I will not discuss this study here in terms of its empirical merits; this is not the place to critically evaluate complex conjectures of homology. Rather, I will attempt to transcend the purely empirical base of comparative anatomy and embryology, instead aiming at the metalevel of a more philosophical discussion. In the discussion to follow, I am speaking not as a scientist looking through a microscope; instead, I am an observer talking about scientists who look through the microscope studying the development of mt5. The study under discussion here was coauthored by three collaborators, two of whom had already published earlier papers that argued against the diapsid relationships of turtles, instead deriving turtles from _Eunotosaurus_ , at the time still considered a parareptile (Lyson et al., 2010). The study of the embryonic development of mt5 in turtles thus proceeded on the background supposition that turtles are nested within Paleozoic anapsid stem-reptiles rather than within diapsids. The first step taken by the investigators was to remove the identity of the hooked fifth metatarsal in the various organisms where it occurs by withdrawing its name: "We herein use the term 'hooked element' when wishing to remain homology neutral" (Joyce, Werneburg, and Lyson, 2013:422). This is the step of breaking out of the entrenchment that ties turtles to diapsid reptiles on the basis of the hooked fifth metatarsal. The goal is to provide a theory-neutral perspective from which to proceed with the investigation. Philosophically speaking, such theory neutrality is not really achievable but rather is itself a theoretical claim: by withdrawing its entrenched name, the hooked fifth metatarsal loses its putative identity in turtles and diapsids. The authors then proceeded to investigate the embryology of this hooked element in turtles; they found it to be the result of a fusion of mt5 with element x. This observation clashed with earlier reports such as Goodrich's and Sewertzoff's, who found that element x is absent rather than fused with mt5 in diapsids. This is the basis on which a new name could be introduced, thus bestowing a different identity on the hooked element of turtles: "[We] suggest the new term 'ansulate bone'... when wishing to express that this bone is the result of fusion" (Joyce, Werneburg, and Lyson, 2013:422). Now there are two names in play: the "ansulate bone" for turtles and the "hooked element" for diapsids. Because the hooked element in diapsids is concluded to be of a different nature than the ansulate bone in turtles, it can retain the traditional name "hooked fifth metatarsal." The use of two different names for mt5 in turtles and diapsid reptiles implies nonhomology and removes the hypothesis of common ancestry. In that way, the use of names—in this case of the names of homologues—and their consequent entrenchment can have profound implications for scientific theory construction.

The above review of the history of investigations into turtle ancestry reveals, I hope, some of the difficulties that plague all attempts to decipher evolutionary, i.e., phylogenetic, relationships. The difficulties start with a disunity of comparative anatomy and molecular biology in phylogenetic analysis, where talks between the two camps break down. The comparative anatomists insist on the centuries-old success of their approach; the DNA people, in contrast, insist on the putative objectivity, and hence superiority, of their modern methods. Further, there are deep conceptual problems in how to comprehend animal development. Is it the case that parts come together to form the whole, or is it the case that the whole is formed by parts that develop from, and out of, one another? A different theoretical understanding of embryonic development can fundamentally influence the ensuing interpretation of observations. Finally, there is the use of language and the names of homologues embedded in it, which can shift the emphasis from one to another hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Then add to those difficulties the more fundamental debates about the virtues or flaws of various methods of analysis, which I have not addressed in this chapter. The reconstruction of evolutionary, i.e., phylogenetic, relationships is not an easy feat, which explains some of the ongoing debates that in one way or another affect most major parts of the tree of life. But amid all these discussions, the issue of turtle relationships stands out as particularly difficult and problematic. The reason is that turtles are indeed separated from all other reptiles, and in fact from all other tetrapods, by a wide anatomical (morphological) gap. Their anatomy is, in many ways, highly unique. This renders their comparison with other reptiles difficult and the assessment of homologies problematic, sometimes controversial. The discussion of how to bridge that gap—how to link turtles to other branches of the reptile tree—takes us to the questions concerning the evolutionary mechanisms that might have resulted in such a distinct anatomical gap. Should the turtle be seen as a hopeful monster? Or alternatively, if evolutionary mechanisms that would result in hopeful monsters do not exist, would the hope instead have to be to bridge the gap that separates turtles from other reptiles with as yet undiscovered fossils?

Turtles Climbing Up the Tree of Life

Opponents of the placement of turtles within diapsid reptiles have drawn attention to a number of features that contradict such a hypothesis. One of these has been the already discussed hooked fifth metatarsal. Another has been the cleithrum, a dermal bone in the shoulder girdle that was lost quite early in reptile evolution and consequently is absent in all diapsids. In a first approach, a process that rises up from the anterior lateral corner of the epiplastral plate in the stem-turtle _Kayentachelys aprix_ from the Early Jurassic of northern Arizona was homologized with the cleithrum: "The presence of cleithra in primitive turtles is a character that supports a basal placement of turtles within Reptilia, rather than a placement within crown Sauria, a clade that demonstrably lacks cleithra" (Joyce, Jenkins, and Rowe, 2006:101). The homology of the epiplastral process with the cleithrum had first been proposed by Otto Jaekel in his 1918 description of _Proganochelys_ from the Late Triassic of Halberstadt, Germany. In his monographic treatment of _Proganochelys_ , Gaffney scrutinized the issue and rejected a putative homology of the epiplastral process with the cleithrum. Jaekel had been misled, Gaffney concluded, because of the incompleteness of the material at his disposal (1990:131).

Indeed, the most recent claim that the epiplastral process of basal turtles is homologous with the cleithrum was dropped in favor of a new hypothesis, which stipulates a homology of the cleithrum with the nuchal bone of the carapace. "The homology of the nuchal with the cleithra bears upon the contentious issue of turtle relationships," as it places turtles once again outside the diapsid reptile radiation (Lyson et al., 2013:323). This interpretation of the nuchal plate as being derived from the left and right cleithrum was supported with reference to "transitional fossils," i.e., "the putative stem-turtle _Eunotosaurus africanus_ " (Lyson et al., 2013:321). But wait a moment: _Eunotosaurus_ —not a parareptile after all, but a stem-turtle instead?

When discussing Lee's (1993) large-scale cladistic analysis of turtle relationships, reference was made to the transformationist paradigm. Adherence to a transformationist paradigm is prevalent in paleontology, and it is beautifully illustrated by recent work on turtle origins and evolution. In the following chapters, the transformationist paradigm will be contrasted with the emergentist paradigm that is more prevalent in evolutionary developmental biology. The transformationist paradigm is firmly rooted in the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution, where organismal change is driven by random variation and natural selection. The result is a gradual and continuous process of transformation, in the course of which all intermediate stages of change must be realized for natural selection to work on. From a transformationist perspective, all the highly derived and specialized features of the turtle body plan must have gradually assembled along the turtle lineage during its evolution. It is at this point where a further commitment of the transformationist paradigm becomes apparent, which is to attribute an ontologically privileged status to fossils in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. That is to say, fossils are valued as the most important evidence in the search for evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships. For any major evolutionary lineage, such as turtles, transformationists tend to distinguish a crown section of living taxa and a stem section accommodating the fossil taxa. The expectation is that the gradual, successive, and stepwise assembly of all the highly derived, specialized features of the turtle body plan can be demonstrated and documented by transitional fossils that line up along the stem section of the turtle tree—provided, of course, that the fossil record is complete enough to allow such a reconstruction of evolutionary history.

Recall the honorable D. M. S. Watson, who in 1914 had claimed that _Eunotosaurus_ is not itself a turtle but rather the ancestor of turtles. After an ancestral turtle from the early Late Triassic of southwestern China, _Odontochelys semitestacea_ , was first described _Eunotosaurus_ from the Permian of South Africa was coded into the data matrix that was used to research the phylogenetic relationships of _Odontochelys_ (Li et al., 2008). _Eunotosaurus_ , represented by newly discovered and better-preserved specimens than had previously been available, was thereby found to be the sister taxon to _Odontochelys_ and all other turtles (Lyson et al., 2010). But the result thus obtained provided no motivation to interpret _Eunotosaurus_ as a stem-turtle. Instead, given the then-accepted classification of _Eunotosaurus_ within the anapsid Paleozoic parareptiles, the result was taken to indicate that "turtles [nest] within 'parareptiles' as the extant sister to Diapsida" (Lyson et al., 2010:830). Significantly, _Eunotosaurus_ was described as preserving "a small, splint-like cleithrum," an element generally absent in diapsid reptiles (Lyson et al., 2013:321). Turtles accordingly are derived from Paleozoic stem-reptiles, not from diapsids. Such a conclusion continued to clash with the molecular findings, which consistently place turtles on the archosaur branch of the reptile tree (Lyson et al., 2012; Field et al., 2014). The conundrum is resolved if _Eunotosaurus_ is removed from the parareptiles and declared a stem-turtle instead. As a transitional fossil that nests at the very base of the turtle stem, illustrating the primitive morphology of the turtle lineage, _Eunotosaurus_ was used to shed new light on the evolution of the turtle shell (carapace) and the correlated changes in the respiratory system of turtles (Lyson et al., 2013, 2014).

The early evolution of the turtle lineage is believed to be further illuminated by another transitional fossil, " _Pappochelys_ , that is structurally and chronologically intermediate between _Eunotosaurus_ and _Odontochelys_ ," the latter the ancestral turtle from the early Upper Triassic of southwestern China (Schoch and Sues, 2015:584). _Pappochelys_ stems from the late Middle Triassic of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and was described as sporting an upper as well as a ventrally open lower temporal fenestra. If correctly identified as a turtle, largely on the basis of broadened ribs with a T-shaped cross section that the fossil shares with _Eunotosaurus_ and _Odontochelys, Pappochelys_ seals a diapsid origin of turtles. These insights motivated a renewed investigation of the skull of _Eunotosaurus_ , which had previously been described as anapsid, i.e., without temporal fenestration (Bever et al., 2015). The skull of _Eunotosaurus_ had long been known to be characterized by a ventral embayment of the cheek region. But the application of modern imaging techniques to new fossils led to the discovery of an upper temporal fenestra in a juvenile skull of _Eunotosaurus_ , a finding that allowed the interpretation of the cheek region as displaying a lower temporal fenestra, with the lower temporal arch having been lost. In adult specimens of _Eunotosaurus_ , the upper temporal fossa is obliterated by an expansion of a neighboring element, the supratemporal. The upshot is that " _Eunotosaurus_ is a diapsid reptile in the process of becoming secondarily anapsid" (Bever et al., 2015:239). Such early obliteration of temporal fenestration in the turtle lineage would thus explain why early fossil turtles such as _Proganochelys_ possess an anapsid skull despite a diapsid origin of turtles. " _Eunotosaurus_ represents a crucially important link in a chain" of turtle evolution, with _Eunotosaurus_ thus being placed at the bottom of the stem section of the turtle tree, followed by _Pappochelys_ and _Odontochelys_ "along the turtle stem," and on to "more crown-ward turtles" (Bever et al., 2015:239, 242, 241).

This is a genuine transformationist perspective, and one that the cladistic revolution had sought to overcome. The cladistic revolution had replaced the search for ancestors and descendants by a search for sister group relationships. Within such a conceptual framework, fossils cannot claim ontological privilege over extant organisms in phylogeny reconstruction. This was one of the profound conceptual innovations that the cladistic revolution brought about. A famous episode relates to a presentation of his phylogenetic systematics by Willi Hennig at the Berlin Natural History Museum on October 30, 1950. Present at that seminar was professor of paleontology Walter Gross (1903–1974), who in the discussion section maintained that only fossils afford the proof of phylogenetic relationships. Hennig reportedly answered, "Your fossils are of no interest to me," whereupon Gross angrily exclaimed, "Then your theories are of no interest to me either," slamming the door as he left the room (Schmitt, 2001:327). What are we to make of such fossils as _Pappochelys_ and _Eunotosaurus_ presented in that transformationist perspective? Unquestionably, the new material of _Eunotosaurus_ recently described has taken us a long way from eminent American paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer's earlier remark that "the animal is... so far removed in so many characters from the true chelonians that herpetologists shudder at the thought of" chelonian relationships (1968:108). More recently, developmental biologist Ann C. Burke found the recognition of _Eunotosaurus_ as a stem-turtle to have "interesting implications for the diapsid root suggested by the genomic data mentioned above, and is likely to be a cause for lively debate" (2015:83).

Running to Stand Still

CHARLES DARWIN WAS NOT THE FIRST TO OFFER A THEORY OF EVOlution. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), for example, had Stand Still famously proposed a theory of species transformation in a two-volume treatise published in 1794–1796. Another illustrious precursor of Darwin was French biologist and paleontologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829), who studied living and fossil mollusks at the National Natural History Museum in Paris. His book on _Philosophie Zoologique_ , published in 1809, proposed an evolutionary theory that was hotly debated well into the first half of the twentieth century, with some discussion lingering on to the present day (Weiss, 2015). What Darwin had achieved was not just to promote the idea that new species originate from ancestral ones, but more importantly to have proposed evolutionary mechanisms that explained such descent with modification without taking recourse to any occult forces active in nature. His is indeed the evolutionary theory that stood the test of time and ultimately prevailed over Lamarck's, even though Darwin's own views were closer to Lamarck's than those of present-day Darwinists, who categorically—and correctly—reject the Lamarckist claim of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. There is, however, a recently growing and rather technical discussion of "environmentally induced gene imprinting" (Wagner, 2014:159; see also the discussion in West-Eberhard, 2003:chap. 1.5), genetic accommodation (West-Eberhard, 2005), or genetic assimilation (e.g., Pigliucci, Murren, and Schlichting, 2006). Both Lamarck and Darwin admitted the possibility that characters, which an organism acquires in the course of its lifetime though use or disuse of organs, could eventually become heritable and thus could be transmitted to offspring. The idea is easily refuted: generations of upper-class Chinese women had their feet bound during childhood and youth to keep them small, a custom pursued for centuries that never rendered small feet a heritable trait.

The remarkable thing about Darwin's achievement was that he had absolutely no theory of inheritance to back up the first sketch of his evolutionary theory, published in _On the Origin of Species_ in 1859. Only much later, in 1868—the _Origin_ was in its fourth edition by that time—did Darwin proffer a theory of inheritance when writing on _The Variation of Plants and Animals under Domestication_. Laws governing regular patterns of inheritance in pea plants discovered by Silesian friar and naturalist Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) had been published two years before, in 1866, in a backwater journal, for which reason they remained ignored and obscure for almost 40 years. Likewise, strange structures had been observed inside the cells of plants and animals, but as of 1866, there was not yet any talk of chromosomes, let alone their role as carriers of heritable traits. Darwin thus did what scientists generally do in such circumstances: he invoked theoretical, i.e., unobserved, particles that would fulfill the role of carriers of hereditary traits in his explanation of the observed phenomena of heritable variation. Darwin assessed the ubiquity of variation, like people having dark hair or blond hair, or blue eyes or brown eyes, and he observed that there was a certain degree of regularity to the patterns of variation, which he thought must be grounded in mechanisms of inheritance. But he and his contemporaries knew of no material basis that would explain how heritable traits are transmitted from parent to offspring. He thus invented it. This is not just old science gone wrong. The stipulation of theoretical, i.e., unobserved, entities is a common tactic during early stages of scientific theory construction. For a modern example, look at the monstrous mutant fruit fly, which grows a leg instead of an antenna out of its head. This is obviously a major change—a fundamental mutation, not just a minor, slight, Darwiniantype variation. How can such freaks of nature happen? How can they be explained? Today, such changes are explained through the recognition of a special class of genes, the so-called _Hox_ genes, an abbreviation for _Homeobox_ genes. The first steps in research that led to the discovery of _Hox_ genes date back to 1983, but the comprehension of their true nature and the way they work took time and effort. In the absence of better knowledge, a purely hypothetical entity was invoked, a so-called switch gene that would flip early developmental pathways from one trajectory into another, as from an antenna to a leg (Raff and Kaufman, 1983:272).

Darwin called the theoretical carriers of heritable traits that he invoked _gemmulae_ , picturing them as minute particles that come together in the formation of the developing embryo. Darwin understood plant and animal development as a coming together of parts rather than as a development of parts from one another. The _gemmulae_ provided the (hypothetical) material basis for Darwin's pangenesis theory. The latter was in turn built on the cell theory developed by botanist Matthias Jacob Schleiden (1804–1881) and zoologist Theodor Schwann (1810–1882). The cell theory states that all organisms are composed of fundamental, divisible building blocks, the cells. The cell theory was firmly established around the mid-nineteenth century and was greatly enhanced by eminent pioneer of cancer research Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), who in 1858 issued a famous statement asserting that "all living cells originate from living cells." The cell was thus recognized as the basic building block of life, meaning that all organisms are composed of one or multiple cells. It is because viruses lack some fundamental components of the cellular machinery that they cannot be considered cellular structures, and hence for many do not represent true organisms. But even with the cell theory in place, Darwin thought that some fundamental aspects of life still lacked a unifying explanation: what is the source of variation so ubiquitously observed in all organisms, both in the wild and under domestication? How are maternal and paternal traits transmitted to offspring? How is it that variation can affect different organs or organ systems in different ways without affecting the harmonious function of the whole organism? And how does all of this tie in with the mechanisms of embryonic development?

The classical ideal of a great scientific explanation has been achieved once as many seemingly disparate observable phenomena as possible have successfully been linked to a common cause, which is exactly the program that Darwin pursued throughout his career. Darwin's _Origin_ of 1859 is a masterpiece in this respect, as it links observable facts of anatomy, embryology, physiology, ecology, biogeography, and animal behavior to a common cause: evolution. Given the particular questions he raised in his 1868 treatise on variation of animals and plants under domestication, he first stated the obvious: all of the observable phenomena in need of an explanation relate back to the fact that organisms, from the fertilized egg through to the fully grown adult, are composed of cells. So Darwin stipulated that the cells of all organisms produce a special kind of offspring, not just other cells through cell division but also _gemmulae_ , minute particles that embody the nature of the cells from which they derive. These _gemmulae_ , circulating through the entire body, would eventually accumulate in the reproductive organs of both parental organisms, male and female. The formation of offspring is thus explained as the coming together of the accumulated stock of maternal and paternal _gemmulae_ , which, under the right circumstances, i.e., in the female uterus, could themselves multiply though division and develop into cells of the same kind as the ones they were themselves derived from. This is an utterly atomistic conception of a developing organism, as it is indeed required for Darwin's theory of fundamental variation. Such an atomistic conception of life has deep roots: it can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Democritus. A more modern version predating Darwin's had been articulated in the mid-eighteenth century by Georges Buffon (1707–1788), director of the Royal Gardens and Natural History Collections in Paris (the precursor to the Paris National Natural History Museum). In about May 1865, perhaps three years before the publication of _Variation of Plants and Animals under Domestication_ , Darwin wrote to his friend and ally, Thomas Huxley (1825–1895), asking him for a "very great favour." Darwin asked Huxley to review what was to become chapter 27 of his book on _Variation of Plants and Animals_ —the very chapter that explicated his pangenesis theory: "It is a very rash and crude hypothesis, yet it has been a considerable relief to my mind, and I can hang on it a good many groups of facts." On July 12, Darwin wrote Huxley again, confiding to his friend, who had previously urged him to do so: "I have read Buffon: whole pages are laughably like mine. It is surprising how candid it makes one to see one's views in another man's words. I am rather ashamed of this whole affair" (Holterhoff, 2014:670; Darwin, 1887:43–45).

Apart from the fact that Darwin's pangenesis theory was eventually superseded by the chromosome theory of inheritance and all the subsequent breathtaking developments of modern molecular genetics, it had one consequence that did not bother Darwin himself but was most unwelcome to his successors. If _gemmulae_ embody the nature of the cells from which they originate, then if a cell's nature changes during the lifetime of an organism, the nature of the _gemmulae_ thrown off by that cell would change accordingly. That means that characteristics an organism acquires during its lifetime, through the intensified use or lack of use of one or the other organ, could be transmitted to its offspring. The cells in the skin covering a farmer's hand change when calluses develop in the course of hard manual labor in the field. According to Darwin's theory, there would be an option for such calluses to become heritable. The inheritance of acquired characteristics was a hallmark of Lamarck's evolutionary theory, one adopted by Darwin but largely rejected by modern genetics.

But what does it mean to say that Darwin's is a theory of fundamental variation? Darwin's pangenesis theory piggybacked on the cell theory. The ultimate building blocks of organisms are the cells. They come together, in his view, to form organs, organ systems, and eventually the whole organism. As a result of its cellular composition, variation can affect the organism in every one of its parts, in ever so slight, perhaps even hardly noticeable, degrees, all the way down to the level of cells. And thanks to the functional independence of the parts, which Darwin believed in, variation could affect one organ system and not the other without interrupting the harmonious functioning of the whole. Such fundamental variation has also been called the basis of evolutionary tinkering: variation tinkers with the organism in one way or another, which then has to prove itself in the organism's interaction with its environment (Monod, 1971). This is the point at which the second component of Darwin's twin mechanisms of evolution, the principle of natural selection, gains purchase. It could be said that variation takes an organism in this or that direction; natural selection approves or rejects. Darwin's reasoning started from a premise he adopted from British scholar Robert Malthus (1766–1834), according to whom natural populations tend to overreproduction, generating offspring in numbers too large to be sustainable given the limited resources the environment has on offer. This constellation must result in a struggle for existence in which favorable variants prevail over less well-adapted ones. The evolutionary success of the better-adapted variants, Darwin argued, is measured in their greater reproductive success compared to the less well-adapted variants. That is to say, favorable variations are transmitted to offspring more frequently than less favorable traits. The net result of this process, driven by random variation and natural selection, is evolutionary change through time. In Darwin's theory, based as it is on the concept of fundamental variation, this process of evolutionary change is a slow, continuous one, proceeding in small steps and playing out at the level of reproductive communities, i.e., in populations of interbreeding organisms. Variation is random, Darwin asserted, but the evolutionary process of change is an adaptive one, as natural selection keeps populations on track with the ever-changing environmental conditions. To maintain adaptation to an ever-changing environment, populations, indeed species, must continuously change as well in a slow and gradual process that is kept going through random variation and natural selection. This is the classical neo-Darwinian theory of evolution that could most easily accommodate quantitative, statistical population genetics as it was developed in the first half of the twentieth century. Ecologist Leigh van Valen (1973) called this process the Red Queen hypothesis. In Darwin's theory, there is no gap possible in the transformation of organisms and the species to which they belong. All intermediate conditions of form must be realized. There cannot be any abrupt, saltational change.

Evolution proceeds along the chain of generations that make up an evolutionary lineage—perhaps at different paces, here faster, there slower, but never in leaps. Take a reproductive community, a population that belongs to a particular species. Interbreeding across the population keeps the species together; the population as a whole forms a gene pool, a shared genetic background. Assume some environmental change splits the population in two in such a way that interbreeding between the two parts of the formerly contiguous population is no longer possible. Imagine, for example, one of the regular sea-level rises as they occurred in the distant past, which resulted in the flooding of low-lying continental areas. The development of such epicontinental seaways could easily split a population of land-roaming animals in two. Given enough time, the two now separated populations would drift apart, genetically speaking. Eventually, when reproductive isolation is achieved through the accumulation of enough genetic change, two new species would have evolved from one ancestral one. When the sea recedes from the continents as a result of a sea-level drop, the two species would no longer be able to interbreed. Darwinian evolution is about the origin of new species from an ancestral one through a gradual, stepwise process of change due to variation and natural selection. Consider what Darwin had to say about his law of natural selection:

It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing but slow changes in progress until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into the long past geological ages that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were. (1859:84)

For Darwin, all evolution is contained in the gradual change of species, as well as in the gradual evolution of new species from an ancestral one. If paleontology (the study of fossils) or comparative anatomy suggested patterns of more profound and abrupt evolutionary change, then Darwin's principles required the explanation of such more profound and seemingly saltational change as one that results from the summation of population-level changes over immense stretches of time. Such a conclusion was hard to stomach for many of his readers and critics. Take the turtle, for example. Here is an animal that develops a shell, a rigid structure encasing the entire trunk, and with it the heart, the kidneys, the intestine, and all other organs, including the lungs. The chest, or more technically speaking the space that contains the lungs, i.e., the pleuroperitoneal cavity, needs to be able to expand as the lungs are filled with air and to recoil as air is expelled from the lungs. How does that go together with the evolution of the turtle shell? It is impossible to evolve a complete turtle shell without also, and concomitantly, changing the mechanism or mechanisms of respiration (for a discussion, see Lyson et al., 2014). There may, in certain cases, obtain a functional independence of organs or organ systems, but in other cases, as in the one just sketched, such independence does not obtain.

Starting with the first edition of the _Origin_ , published in 1859, there were a number of criticisms leveled against Darwin's theory, most of which later came to be ascribed to the camp of neo-Lamarckians, i.e., early twentieth-century biologists and paleontologists who revived, in one form or another, ideas about the inheritance of acquired characteristics that in a loose sense could be traced back to Darwin's predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Some readers of Darwin's 1859 sketch of evolutionary theory first and foremost objected to his materialistic, indeed mechanistic, approach to the mysteries of life. How could it be that random variation and natural selection could provide a sufficient explanation for the coming into being of those "endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful," as Darwin (1859:490) had himself called them, and for their persistence on the surface of the globe? How could it be that all those "forms most beautiful and most wonderful" had been shaped in the past by only two mechanisms, random variation and natural selection? How could it be that the harmonious function of the complex whole that is an organism would not be disrupted by variation? Variation is a property that manifests itself in organisms, but it cannot—according to Darwin—shape the organism, as it is random in its nature. The force that shapes organisms in Darwin's theory is natural selection, but that is a force external to the organism. The actions of natural selection have once been compared to those of a sculptor, who chips away at a chunk of rock so as to form from it an object of art. With natural selection, it is the environment taxing the effects of random variation. Even more, that selective tax is levied by the environment on adult organisms—those that are ready to compete for reproductive success. How does such an external mechanism targeting the reproductive stage of organisms work on changes that affect early embryonic development, asked many a critic of Darwin? For these critics, a plethora of questions remained to be answered. Others agreed that natural selection is a necessary component driving evolutionary change but that it is not also a sufficient component to explain all evolutionary change, especially the patterns of change manifest in the fossil record.

François Jules Pictet de La Rive (1809–1872) was only one of many reviewers of Darwin's _Origin_ of 1859. Pictet was born into a family that formed part of the gentility of Geneva. After studies in Geneva and Paris, he became professor of geology, paleontology, and zoology at the Academy, later renamed University, of Geneva. In addition to his duties as an academician, Pictet upheld the family tradition of engaging in the political leadership of his hometown and state, canton of Geneva (<http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F3884.php>, accessed June 20, 2016). Darwin himself considered Pictet's review " _perfectly_ fair and just, and I agree to every word he says.... Of all the opposed reviews, I think this the only quite fair one, and I never expected to see one" (Darwin to Asa Gray, April 3, 1860, quoted in Hull, 1973:142). Pictet published his review in French in the _Archives des Sciences de la Bibliothèque Universelle_ in March 1860. There is "in Mr. Darwin's book," Pictet complained, "a sudden leap by which the reader is asked to pass from the prudent study of facts to the most extreme theoretical consequences" (cited in Hull, 1973:144). In Darwin's account, all those characters essential for survival that mark out species, genera, families, orders, and classes of organisms would have evolved from a small number of ancestral types over an "immense series of centuries"; "because these bold deductions do not appear to be justified by the facts, it is necessary to have a more powerful argument before accepting them" (cited in Hull, 1973:145). Pictet ultimately embraced the existence of two forces active in nature, "one normal generation and the other the creative force" (cited in Hull, 1973:151). Normal generation results in the type of variation seen within and between species, the type of variation so arduously studied by Darwin. But to arrive at a new body plan, such as that of an ichthyosaur, a pterosaur, or a turtle, to him seemed to require a special creative force. Reading Pictet's review, Darwin concluded, "Our only difference being that he attaches less weight to arguments in my favour, and more to arguments opposed, than I do" (Darwin to Asa Gray, April 3, 1860, cited in Hull, 1973:142).

The creative force that the Lamarckian opponents of Darwin such as Pictet appealed to was not a force exerted by some almighty Creator, however, but instead a creative force that would drive evolutionary change from within the organisms. Variation and a force such as natural selection that works exclusively from the outside they viewed as insufficient to explain major evolutionary changes, such as those involved in the origin of fundamentally different body plans: mollusks, echinoderms, vertebrates, tetrapods, turtles. The reason was that Darwinian natural selection was understood to tax organisms at their adult, reproductive stage in terms of relative reproductive success. How could a mechanism like that explain the fact that major body plans are laid down during early stages of embryonic development? A gastropod and a sea urchin differ from one another in most fundamental ways during embryonic development, starting from the very first cleavage stages of the fertilized egg cell. Starfish exhibit radial symmetry, vertebrates (like humans) exhibit bilateral symmetry, and many shelled gastropods (snails) exhibit torsion in their body plans. How do such deep differences between phyla originate? How can one body plan change into another? It seemed to many biologists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that an internal force was required that would redirect inherited developmental processes toward new, indeed innovative, pathways. Few would deny natural selection the role Darwin ascribed to it, but they denied natural selection the power to cause such profound evolutionary changes during early development as are required in the evolution of new body plans. Critics of Darwin also rejected the notion of evolutionary tinkering. They did not believe in a fundamental autonomy and functional independence of organs and organ systems. Instead, they viewed the organism as a developmentally and functionally integrated complex whole, whose parts are interdependent in many ways. Such integration, indeed a fundamental unity of the organism, they found to be most evident in its embryonic development. To them, it seemed unacceptable that chance variation could interfere here and there while still allowing the embryo to continue normal development. An inner creative principle seemed to be required that would maintain harmonious functional integration among the parts of the organisms through evolutionary changes that would manifest themselves along new developmental pathways that deviate from the ancestral ones.

Finally, there was the problem of the succession of intermediate forms. If it was true that even the most profound changes in body plan, as are evident in a comparison of a lizard with a turtle, could exclusively be explained through a slow, gradual, species-level process of change, as Darwin's theory required, all intermediate conditions of form would have to have been realized in the deep past. We would expect to find at least some of them in the form of fossilized remains. Echinoderms have a rich fossil record, but intermediate forms illuminating their evolutionary origin have so far remained elusive. Turtle origins are controversial precisely because intermediate forms that would settle the question remain controversial. The "number of intermediate varieties," Darwin mused, must have been "truly enormous": "Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record" (1859:280).

The Sudden Appearance of Turtles

One of the pioneering experts working on fossil turtles was Ludwig Rütimeyer (1825–1895), born in the hamlet of Biglen in Emmental, canton of Bern, in Switzerland (Schmidt, 1896). After graduating from grammar school, Rütimeyer enrolled at the University of Bern, where—following family tradition—he took up the study of theology. He eventually switched to medical school, however, passing his state examination in 1850. A student still, he participated in the 33rd annual meeting of the Swiss Academy of Sciences in Solothurn, Switzerland, in 1848, where he presented the results of his investigations into the regional geology. Not much attracted to medical practice, Rütimeyer left in November 1850 for Paris to study zoology at the National Natural History Museum. After a period of teaching at the University of Bern, punctuated by travels all across Europe, the newly wed Rütimeyer was named professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel in 1855, where he embarked on a stellar academic career. He was elected president of the University of Basel in 1864 and became an honorary citizen of Basel in 1867. His research focused on paleontology of vertebrates, especially mammals, including mammalian remains from archaeological sites, and geology, including hydrogeology. Rütimeyer died in Basel on November 25, 1895.

Rütimeyer delivered his inaugural speech to mark his appointment as professor at the University of Basel on January 18, 1856. The title of his lecture was "Ueber Form und Geschichte des Wirbelthier-Skelettes" (The form and history of the vertebrate skeleton) (Rütimeyer, 1898a). Writing three years before the publication of Darwin's _Origin_ , Rüti-meyer's understanding of nature was firmly rooted in divine creation, yet he sketched the modifications of the vertebrate skeleton in an ascending series from lamprey to shark to human in a way that would readily lend itself to a transformationist, i.e., evolutionary, interpretation. Indeed, Rütimeyer introduced a number of laws of form generation he had heard about during his studies in Paris, emphasizing that in all major groups of vertebrates, there still existed the potential for a multiplication and diversification of variant forms beyond the extinct and still existing ones. On that account, the Creator becomes the entity to trigger the process of transformation and diversification of organisms, a process that, once set in motion, is governed by laws of nature, the latter enacted by the Creator again.

Rütimeyer's laudatory speech, delivered in November 1865, after the first year of his tenure as president of the University of Basel, marks another milestone in his career and at the same time reveals that in the meantime, he had come to endorse the Darwinian theory of evolution. Paleontology, the study of fossils, adds the dimension of time to natural history, he argued, thus turning the study of natural history into the study of the history of nature. The historical dimension is also what distinguishes natural history from experimental sciences such as physics and chemistry. The latter allow for experimentation, whereas the study of the history of nature does not. History is, in Rütimeyer's account, a unique, irreversible process unfolding through time. The great embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer, who taught at the universities of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), St. Petersburg, and Dorpat, had traced the transformation of animal form throughout embryonic development, Rütimeyer recalled. The great comparative and functional anatomist as well as paleontologist Georges Cuvier (1769–1832), from the Paris National Natural History Museum, had traced the alterations of animal form throughout earth's history. Interestingly, some parallels appeared to be present in the alterations of animal form through embryonic development and through geological time. The question remained, argued Rütimeyer, whether these alterations of form that are evident in the fossil record have separately been created, as Cuvier had argued, or whether they are connected through an organic tie of descent with modification, as Darwin had argued (Rütimeyer, 1898b:119). To investigate this latter question, Rütimeyer insisted, is the most noble current task of natural history. Darwin, he concluded, had made the most recent, most illuminating effort in that direction. Rütimeyer had personal contact with Darwin. When in 1859 he started to investigate subfossil animal, especially mammal, remains recovered from pile dwellings discovered along lakesides in Switzerland, "Darwin took a most animated interest in that research and asked me many questions," Rütimeyer reminisced (1898a:21). On Darwin, he wrote in 1882, "It cannot be denied that the shockwave that was triggered by Darwin's publications was powerful and far-reaching to such an extent as is generally known to be set off only by sparks emanating from theological or philosophical dogmatics" (1898c:373). Rütimeyer "welcomed Darwin's ideas and made the theory of descent the foundation of his future research program" (Reif, 1986:84). Although he all the while recognized the epoch-making scientific achievements of Darwin, as well as the moderation with which the great man laid out his thoughts in his books, Rütimeyer nonetheless challenged the twin mechanisms of variation and natural selection as a sufficient explanation of all organic change, especially as observed in the fossil record. He rejected the brute physicalism of Darwin's theory of pangenesis in favor of a progressive force inherent in organisms, pushing evolutionary transformation of organic beings to ever higher levels of perfection (Rütimeyer, 1898c:381).

Although Rütimeyer established himself as a leading pioneer expert in turtle anatomy and classification, he considered his work on fossil turtles a sideline of his research, which otherwise mostly centered on fossil mammals. "Casual work" he called his research on turtles (Rütimeyer, 1898d:28), which he undertook during the years 1859 through 1874 to accommodate the request of his friend, Professor Franz Lang (1821–1899), successor of Franz Josef Hugi (1791–1855) in the position of the director of the Natural History Museum in Solothurn, Switzerland. Fossil turtle remains had started to show up in limestone quarries north of the city of Solothurn in the early 1820s. Their frequency and exquisite state of preservation secured the quarry workers welcome additional income through the sale of fossils to collectors: a well-preserved carapace fetched up to 1,500 Swiss francs—a handsome sum at the time. One of the first collectors was F. J. Hugi, professor of physics and natural history at the collegium (grammar school) in Solothurn. Hugi eventually lost his professorship after his conversion from the Catholic to the Evangelical church, a development that forced him to strike a deal with the city: Solothurn would build a natural history museum and install him as its director with a pension of 900 Swiss francs annually, while Hugi would donate his extensive collection to the city, with it becoming the core of the museum's holdings. The museum collections continued to grow, for at Hugi's request, the workers employed in the quarries operated by the city of Solothurn had to relinquish their findings—for adequate compensation—to the museum. (For more information on F. J. Hugi, see <http://wiki.stadtgeschichte-grenchen.ch/mediawiki/index.php?title=Franz_Josef_Hugi>, accessed June 20, 2016.) The quarries, the commercial operation of which came to an end in the early 1920s as a result of economic conditions, yielded not just turtles but also sharks' teeth, the odd rare crocodile jaw, and a variety of invertebrates. However, turtles were the most spectacular faunal elements and gave the limestone its name: _calcaire à tortues de Soleure_ (Solothurn Turtle Limestone). Swiss geologist and paleontologist Amanz Gressly (1814–1865) introduced the name in 1841. The limestone is a marine deposit of Kimmeridgian age, some 155 million years old, and its fossils are thus inhabitants of the Jurassic sea. Hugi sent a fossil turtle skull from the Solothurn Turtle Limestone to the grand master of vertebrate paleontology, Georges Cuvier in Paris, who published an illustration of the specimen in the second edition of his multivolume encyclopedia on fossil vertebrates. The copper engraving represents "the oldest identifiable figure of a fossil turtle skull," dating from 1824 (Gaffney, 1975a:2). (For a history of the discovery and a review of the Jurassic turtles of Solothurn, see Bräm 1965.)

Rütimeyer published his first monograph on the Jurassic sea turtles from Solothurn in 1866, with his friend Franz Lang as first author; a second monograph with Rütimeyer as the sole author followed in 1873. In that same year, he summarized his findings in the serial of the Natural History Society of Basel. The turtles, he wrote, was the first project that got him involved with the study of the osteology of reptiles, and he expressed his opinion—one that is still valid today—that fossils can really only be properly understood in the light of a comparison with living relatives (Rütimeyer, 1873:5, 7). In his autobiography, he recounted how he obtained comparative material of extant turtles from zoological collections in Munich, Leiden, Frankfurt am Main, and Stuttgart, but also from acquaintances and friends traveling in distant countries such as Guatemala, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, and the wilderness of West Africa (Rütimeyer, 1898d:28ff.). The material he amassed became an important addition to the skeletal collections kept at the Basel Natural History Museum. As many would do after him, Rütimeyer already fretted about what the primitive condition of the turtle body plan would be. On account of their rudimentary carapace, he found soft-shelled turtles to be the closest to lizards, but he noted the even stranger condition of the carapace in living sea turtles, one that combines with a complete bony roofing of the cheek region in the skull. There prevailed among turtles a mosaic distribution of characters he found difficult to understand. In contrast to, for example, the transformation series of fossil horses, where every step of progressive digit reduction in fore- and hind limbs is documented in the fossil record, he was unable to identify a progressive evolutionary trend in fossil and living turtles, which all display the classic turtle body plan, including a completely developed shell. This rendered identification of the primitive condition of shell and skull in turtles all the more difficult, quite in contrast to the horses. In horses, the earliest fossils were small animals with four digits in the hand (manus) and three digits in the foot (pes), clearly the primitive condition compared to the large modern horse, which has retained only a single digit (the third) in its hands and feet. All of this rendered any conclusion as to the origin of turtles highly conjectural:

The fossil record as much as living forms do not provide any information on the relations of the bizarre and isolated type of turtles to other groups of reptiles. As far as we know them today, the turtles appear fully armored on the scene. We have so far not discovered any possible root form.... Perhaps the discovery of placodont skeletons might help in that regard.... One last point deserves attention: it is the finished appearance of the type of turtles with highly perfected representatives in relatively old geological formations. (Rütimeyer, 1873:135ff.)

Turtle origins remained obscured by their sudden appearance in a "finished" form in the fossil record. No intermediate forms were known that would link them to other groups of reptiles—a link that might have provided a clue as to what the primitive condition of the turtle body plan would have been. Perhaps Darwin's account of slow, gradual evolutionary transformation was incomplete after all. Perhaps the question of sudden saltational evolutionary change still had to be considered. These were questions that Rütimeyer left for others to ponder, however.

Echinoderm Begets Mollusk, Turtle Emerges from an Amphibian Egg

The recognition of the sudden appearance of finished body plans in the fossil record, without intermediate forms disclosing their ancestry (or affinity, as it was talked about in the decades before Darwin), is as old as the science of paleontology itself. Similarly, the question of how a transformation could be possible that would bridge the sometimes profound anatomical gaps that separate the major body plans exemplified by the major groups of organisms in existence today is as old as the sciences of comparative anatomy and embryology. Both of these questions were certainly the focus of interest of mid-nineteenth-century comparative anatomists, comparative embryologists, and paleontologists. The era was rife with unbridled speculation and bold theories, but none was as incredulous as the one proposed by perhaps the preeminent comparative anatomist, physiologist, and marine biologist of his time, Johannes Müller (1801–1858), from the University of Berlin. The publication of his _Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen_ in 1833–1840 (which appeared in English as _Elements of Physiology_ in 1837–1843) was an international success, as it marked the beginning of a modern integrative approach to human physiology. Working in the marine zoological station in Trieste, Italy, in the summer of 1851, Müller focused his attention on the reproductive anatomy and physiology of the echinoderm holothurian called _Synapta digitata_ , which was found in abundance in the Bay of Muggia in the Adriatic Sea near Trieste. What his observations revealed, however, failed to ignite in him that

joyful excitement that comes with a fruitful insight into nature, or with the discovery of an understandable fact that furthers comprehension; instead, the first and lasting impression was disquieting, confusing, and humiliating. I felt that I would for a long time, perhaps forever, remain incapable to understand, what the testimony of the senses demonstrated to me on a daily basis.... When observation had progressed to the establishment of several most extraordinary facts, I felt it necessary that these be confirmed through the testimony of more than merely one pair of eyes. (1852a:iii)

He went to great lengths to have a famous colleague, German physiologist Rudolph Wagner (1805–1864) from the University of Göttingen, whom he coincidentally met in Trieste, confirm his observations, and he asked his own son, who accompanied him on this trip, to do the same. He then proceeded to present his observations at meetings of the Berlin Academy of Sciences in October and November 1851, and at the same time he wrote a letter summarizing his findings to the National Academy of Sciences in Paris. He published a monograph detailing his investigations (1852a), as well as a summary in English in _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ (1852b). Müller's incredible claim was that with _Synapta_ , he had found a sea cucumber that begets snails: an echinoderm gives birth to a mollusk. Initially confirming previous descriptions by other authors of the reproductive organs in _Synapta_ , he reported: "Around the middle of August I met for the first time with an individual with a totally different generative organ," one that contained "young mollusks with spiral shells" (1852b:230ff.). This organ he called the "molluskigerous organ," noting, "It is impossible to determine with any certainty, what is the proportion of individuals with molluskigerous organs to those with normal ovaria" (1852b:24). A commentator writing about his English abstract attributed to its author "the well-known care and accuracy" for which the latter was famous, in light of which there was no reason to cast doubt on the observed facts. "It is another affair, however, with regard to the _deductions_ from those facts... we must confess to being anything but convinced, that the Professor's conclusions are either necessary or even well-founded" ( _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ [1852] 9:37ff). Indeed, Müller had failed to recognize the parasitic nature of the minute snails he had found inside the holothurian. However, given Müller's stature in German biology, it is hardly surprising that Ludwig Büchner (1824–1899) commented in his hugely influential best-selling book, _Kraft und Stoff_ , on Müller's observations concerning the "generation of snails in holothurians": "Holothurians and snails belong to two fundamentally different sections of the animal kingdom... [Müller's] observations, should they be confirmed in all aspects, would prove the possibility, still denied today, that in historical times, one kind of animal can originate from another kind in an instantaneous transition or act of emergence" (Büchner, 1856:80).

Bizarre as this episode is, it testifies to the readiness to entertain even the most implausible conjectures to explain the transition from one body plan to another on the basis of purely natural, mechanistic forces. A certain consensus was building that major transformations of animal organization could only occur in a saltational way, just as organisms with a complex life cycle, such as insects, change from larva to pupa to imago without intermediate stages between those three. No lesser a person than eminent German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), who never pursued any biological research himself, had, in a text published in 1851, emphatically denied the possibility of the spontaneous generation of higher animals from decaying organic matter. But how, then, did the diversity of higher animals come into being? His conclusion was through "birth from a parent belonging to a different species from that of the offspring":

The genesis of these higher forms can be conceived only as a _generatio in utero heterogeneo_ , such that from the womb, or rather from the egg, of some especially favored pair of animals, when the life force of their species was in them raised to an abnormal potency, there arose... [under the right circumstances]... exceptionally, no longer a being of the same kind as its parents.... In such a case the parent would for once have produced not merely an individual but a species. (Schopenhauer, 1851:121; translation from Lovejoy, 1959:425ff.)

Some examples for such origins adduced by Schopenhauer included a snake emerging from the egg of a fish, the emergence of a turtle from the egg of an amphibian, and the emergence of the platypus from the egg of a duck (1851:122). A turtle hatching from a batrachian egg might sound a bit extreme, yet Rütimeyer himself toyed with the idea that chelonians could have had a separate origin from long-extinct amphibians called labyrinthodonts (their name accounting for the specialized labyrinthine internal structure of their teeth). Even as late as 1962, Kuhn-Schnyder proclaimed at the annual meeting of the Paläontologische Gesellschaft (Paleontological Society) in Tübingen, Germany, that turtles might very well have had a separate origin from among fossil amphibians (1962:80).1 Nielsson (1945) had previously already postulated an independent origin of turtles from Triassic plagiosaur labyrinthodont amphibians. Kuhn-Schnyder thought the same of placodonts and ichthyosaurs, thus rendering reptiles a thoroughly unnatural, polyphyletic grouping of multiple separate origins. A group is called polyphyletic if it includes the descendants of more than one ancestor. It was this enthusiasm for multiple and diverse origins, popular at the time in vertebrate paleontology, that would become the target of the cladistic revolution, which insisted on the principle of monophyly to circumscribe natural groups.

Insight into turtle origins remained largely elusive during the second half of the nineteenth century. The years 1887 to 1890 saw the publication of the massive third volume of the _Handbuch der Palaeontologie_ (Textbook of paleontology), edited by Munich paleontologist Karl A. Zittel (1839–1904), who summarized the various propositions about turtle origins entertained at that time: hypothetical turtle ancestors included fossil amphibians (labyrinthodonts), various subgroups of mammal-like reptiles (synapsids), sauropterygians such as placodonts, and rhynchocephalians, the fossil relatives of the tuatara (Zittel, 1887–1890:552). The famous turtle from the Late Triassic of Germany, _Proganochelys quenstedti_ , had already been described by Baur in 1887, who noted, "The darkness that surrounds the origin of turtles yet intensifies when one realizes that the oldest turtle (at this time)... has a completely closed carapace and plastron" (cited in Gaffney, 1990:12). _Proganochelys_ , which was some 215 million years old, was to remain the oldest known fossil turtle for more than a century. A slightly younger fossil (approximately 205 million years old) from the Late Triassic of the Bavarian Alps named _Psephoderma_ was at that time considered to represent a turtle as well. _Psephoderma_ consisted of the fossil remains of a carapace-like structure that Frankfurt-based paleontologist Hermann von Meyer (1801–1869) had described in 1858. Of that fossil, Cope noted, "The oldest Tortoises have generally the most incomplete carapace and plastron; among them the _Psephoderma_ allied to _Sphargis_ " (1871:232)—a relationship Meyer (1858:250) had explicitly rejected. _Sphargis_ is an invalid old name for _Dermochelys_ , the leatherback sea turtle. _Psephoderma_ is today recognized as an armored placodont unrelated to turtles, but these early uncertainties about its placement show how similar the carapace can appear between a placodont and some turtles, especially the leatherback.

Evolution by Leaps and Bounds

The first to build a substantial case for turtle origins from armored placodonts was, as already mentioned, Otto Jaekel, dinosaur hunter of Halberstadt fame. How did he explain the evolutionary origin of such distinct body plans as the turtle's? Jaekel sketched his ideas on the evolutionary transformation of body plans in a highly influential talk he presented at the Fifth International Zoological Congress held in Berlin in 1901, and again in the keynote presentation on the "Tasks and Goals of Paleontology," which he delivered at the founding meeting of the Paläontologische Gesellschaft in 1912, held in Budapest (Jaekel, 1902b; Jaekel, 1914). Jaekel returned to the topic one more time at the 1921 meeting of the Paläontologische Gesellschaft, held in Frankfurt am Main (Jaekel, 1922). Jaekel was a neo-Lamarckian, rejecting natural selection as the major force driving evolution. Like other neo-Lamarckians at the time, he stipulated an internal force that would sustain evolutionary change. In addition, he also defended the doctrine of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Function, in his view, shaped the form of organs and organ systems in organisms, not the other way around, as was claimed by Darwinians, according to whom the shape of an organ determines its function. Jaekel famously opposed the Darwinian selectionist doctrine with his slogan: "Form changes as a consequence of its activity" (1916:38). The reception of the Darwinian evolutionary theory in Germany was largely linked to August Weismann's (1834–1914) hugely influential doctrine that an impenetrable barrier prevents the body of the organism from having any influence on its genes. Genes control the development and function of an organism for sure, and to the degree that genes mutate and are recombined through sexual reproduction, the organism's offspring will be subject to variation, the raw material for natural selection to work on. What is impossible, according to Weismann and the Darwinians who endorsed his views, is that changes that an organism undergoes during its lifetime as the consequence of the use or disuse of organs can be inscribed in its genes. This remains the widely accepted view today, but it means that the form of organs and organ systems is primarily inherited, then in its function tested by natural selection. The Lamarckian principle requires, in contrast, that the functionality of an organ or organ system is first tested through its use, after which—if it passes the test—it is inscribed in the genes of the organism. Such neo-Lamarckism was widespread in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries on both sides of the Atlantic. Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn, whose influence on reptile classification was sketched in the previous chapter, were both prominent neo-Lamarckians in the United States.

However, the internal force active within organisms that Jaekel appealed to did not serve only as a conduit allowing external factors to shape the genetic constitution of organisms by shaping their organs and organ systems first. It was more forceful than that—indeed, it put the evolutionary transformation of organisms "on rails," i.e., it endowed the evolutionary process with a predetermined direction (the expression "evolution on rails" is borrowed from Levit and Olsson, 2006). According to Jaekel, and many of his fellow neo-Lamarckians, each major evolutionary lineage—the dinosaurs, the ichthyosaurs, the pterosaurs, the turtles—represents a distinct body plan. Driven by an internal force active within each individual organism, every one of these major evolutionary lineages would evolve along a trajectory that runs parallel to an organism's individual life cycle. Just as an organism is born, passes through a juvenile stage to adulthood, then following adult life enters senescence and eventually dies, so is every major evolutionary lineage first born (through its origin), then passes in geologic time through stages of youthfulness, adulthood, senescence, and death (i.e., extinction). The most vigorous stage along that evolutionary trajectory is that of youth. It is during that youthful phase of its evolution that a rapid evolutionary diversification within an evolutionary lineage can occur through the multifarious adaptation of the basic body plan that characterizes each respective lineage to various conditions of life. It is during the youthful stage of their evolutionary lineage that dinosaurs diversified to become herbivores or carnivores, small and large. It is during the youthful stage of its evolution that the turtle lineage gave rise to species that invaded the sea, the lakes, or the desert. All turtles retained the same basic body plan while evolving, within that frame, specializations that made life in freshwater ponds or in the karst mountains possible.

Such goal-directed and cyclical evolution that takes each major evolutionary lineage through periods of origination, youth and adulthood, and senescence and death is called orthogenetic evolution, or orthogenesis. The word is derived from the Greek terms _orthos_ , "straight," and _genesis_ , "origin" and/or "mode of formation of something." Orthogenesis—a goal-directed and cyclical pattern of evolution—and the internal force supposedly driving it are no longer maintained by modern evolutionary theory, although the fossil record does in certain cases display patterns of change that invite such far-fetched explanations. However, an even more difficult question that confronted Jaekel concerned the birth, i.e., origin, of such major evolutionary lineages, because this implies the origin of a new, distinct body plan from an ancestral one. How does the highly distinctive body plan, such as that of a turtle, come into being in the first place? More importantly, barring special creation, evolutionary lineages must have an ancestor from which they originate; turtles must have descended from some other reptiles. This in turn means that the evolutionary origin of a new body plan implies the transformation of an ancestral body plan into a descendant one. How can that happen?

Orthogenetic evolution mirrors the individual life cycle, from origin/birth to extinction/death. For evolutionary lineages, Jaekel envisaged the youthful stage to be the most pliable; it is at this stage that adaptive diversification occurs within an evolutionary lineage—always within the constraints of the underlying body plan, of course. Birds of paradise and ostriches live vastly different lives, but both are still immediately recognizable as birds. Because orthogenetic evolution mirrors the individual life history of an organism, it should then, by analogy, be the early stages during embryonic development of an organism that should be the most pliable—the stages at which developmental patterns that establish the ancestral body plan can be disrupted and new developmental patterns put into place that result in a new, descendant body plan. This indeed was Jaekel's conclusion. The process involved in the evolution of a new body plan Jaekel called metakinesis: "Metakinesis means jolting... an almost violent, in any case profound transformation of form... one that is unthinkable in the adult condition of form, but rather one that can occur during early embryonic stages only, at which the cellular structure of various organs is not yet fully differentiated and for that reason retain developmental plasticity" (1902b:51).

The further an organism progresses in its development, the more its cellular structure becomes determined, and the less plasticity remains for profound transformation. Jaekel was quick to point out that his concept of metakinesis is not the same as the origin of a new species from an ancestral one. The latter, he claimed, is just the summation of variation and natural selection over time the way Darwin had described it. Metakinesis, in contrast, results in a radical rejuvenation of major evolutionary lineages. This is important, because Jaekel here draws a distinction between two different levels and two different modes of evolution. Darwin and his successors had reduced all evolutionary change to the summation of small changes over vast stretches of time, playing out at the level of interbreeding populations that represent species. Evolutionary change is thereby tied to either the gradual transformation of a species through time or the origin of two daughter species from an ancestral one through a process called speciation. To evolve a new body plan from an ancestral one would require, in Darwin's account, a prolonged process of species transformation or an extended string of speciation processes, with the resulting expectation that the fossil record should be packed with intermediates. Jaekel did not deny that evolution occurs at the species level, as new species originate from ancestral ones, but he rejected the idea that the origin of new body plans could be reduced to this level of evolution. Instead, he invoked a second, higher level of evolution: the level of major evolutionary lineages. It is at this higher level that new body plans evolve from ancestral ones, he argued, and they originate through the perturbation and reorganization of early developmental processes at a stage at which the embryo still retains a high degree of plasticity and potential for transformation. The shaking up of early developmental stages, the falling into place of new developmental pathways—this is how Jaekel thought new body plans come into being: via a rapid, indeed saltational, process of change that, if successful and viable, results in the evolutionary establishment of a new body plan. A new major evolutionary lineage is then ready to take off—to enter its youthful phase of proliferation and diversification. Jaekel's model of orthogenetic evolution is thoroughly cyclical, with the senescence of major evolutionary lineages being punctuated by evolutionary rejuvenation through metakinesis.

Jaekel was an extraordinarily prolific writer, publishing papers and books in geology, paleontology, human prehistory, arts, and politics. Not all of his contributions were judged successful by his peers. One obituary, penned by a fellow paleontologist, noted, "Who would argue that with so much light, shadows could be missing?" (Drevermann, 1929:183). His views on evolution gained widespread acceptance, however. Among his most influential admirers was the neo-Lamarckian Othenio Abel (1875–1946) from the University of Vienna (and later from Göttingen), one of the most influential paleontologists of the early twentieth century. Abel is generally considered the father of paleobiology, the science that pursues the analysis of fossil remains from a distinctly biological perspective in an attempt to reconstruct the mode of life of long-extinct organisms. In the course of his career, Abel compromised himself through his entanglement with Nazi biopolitics (Taschwer, 2012; Rieppel, 2013b). As a consequence, he lost his position at the University of Vienna in 1934, but he was reinstated as full professor at the University of Göttingen in 1935. In 1938, Abel joined Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). After his retirement in 1940, he tried to establish an institute for paleobiology in Salzburg with the financial support of an ss organization, the Ancient Heritage Foundation (Ahnenerbe). The Ancient Heritage Foundation was a branch of the ss that funded research, particularly research illuminating the origins of the Aryan race both physically and culturally. Salzburg, a town in Austria that had become part of the German Reich in 1938, had been selected by Heinrich Himmler to become a stronghold of Aryan biology.2 The turmoil of war meant that Abel's plan never came to fruition. Another admirer of Jaekel was neo-Lamarckian invertebrate paleontologist Karl Beurlen (1901–1985), another Nazi sympathizer who joined the NSDAP in 1933, with the consequent prospect of a stellar career at German universities in Kiel and Munich, not just in paleontology, but in the fiscal management of earth sciences in the Third Reich in general until his fall in 1945 (Rieppel, 2012). After World War II, Beurlen had to support his family as a construction worker until his emigration to Brazil in 1950, where he succeeded to launch a second academic career. After his retirement in 1969, he returned to Tübingen and became an activist campaigning against the construction of nuclear power plants (Tollmann, 1986). Whereas his first publication on the foundations, methods, and problems of phylogenic reconstruction, dating back to 1930 and based mainly on his PhD thesis, remains sober and factual in tone, his "big book" of 1937 presents an evolutionary synthesis heavily, indeed grotesquely, tainted with _völkisch_ nature mysticism, the latter aligned with Nazi ideology (Beurlen, 1930, 1937).

The publication of Beurlen's PhD thesis in 1930 exerted a major influence on another young invertebrate paleontologist, Otto Schindewolf (1896–1971). Born in Hanover, Schindewolf found early fascination in geology and paleontology when, as a high school student, he became member of the Niedersächsischer Geologischer Verein (Geological Society of Lower Saxony). In 1914, he enrolled at Georg August University in Göttingen to study paleontology under Rudolf Wedekind (1883–1961), a biostratigrapher. In 1917, Schindewolf followed Wedekind to the University of Marburg, where he earned his PhD in 1919. His prizewinning doctoral thesis on the systematics, biostratigraphy, and paleobiogeography of Paleozoic (Late Devonian through Early Carboniferous) cephalopods (ammonites) from Bavaria established Schindewolf's reputation as a gifted biostratigrapher. His _Habilitation_ followed in 1921, and in 1927 he was named honorary professor (somewhat equivalent to adjunct professor). In the same year, after his promotion, Schindewolf relocated to Berlin to join the Prussian Geological Survey. With the dawn of the National Socialist regime, Schindewolf kept up a loyal public face to the degree necessary, but he distanced himself from the Nazis in private and avoided colleagues who openly collaborated with the regime, such as Beurlen, as best he could.3 Schindewolf emerged from the war uncompromised and became an associate, and soon thereafter full, professor at Humboldt University in Berlin, the latter located in the eastern sector of the city. In 1948, he accepted the offer of a position as full professor of geology and paleontology at the Eberhard Karls University in Tübingen, where he spent the rest of his career. It is particularly during his Tübingen years that Schindewolf exerted tremendous influence in German paleontology, not only through his larger-than-life personality but also through training scores of students, many of whom secured academic careers. He died in Tübingen on June 10, 1971 (for more details and references to obituaries for Schindewolf, see Rieppel, 2008).

Jaekel, Abel, Beurlen, Schindewolf—they all differed to some degree in their views on phylogeny and the evolutionary mechanisms driving it, but only with respect to details and terminology. Unlike the others, Schindewolf—a latecomer in that respect—was not a neo-Lamarckian; indeed, he rejected neo-Lamarckism outright. But they all shared some important ground that is common to all orthogenetic renditions of evolutionary theory: (1) the cyclicity of evolution, where major evolutionary lineages pass through stages of birth, youthfulness, adulthood (maturity), senescence, and death; (2) the recognition of two levels of evolutionary change, the lower being that of the species and the higher being that of major evolutionary lineages representing distinct body plans; (3) the origin of new body plans from ancestral ones through the repatterning of early developmental (embryonic) stages; and (4) the fact that such early ontogenetic repatterning results in saltational evolutionary change, leaving no intermediates behind. To characterize such saltational patterns of evolutionary change, Schindewolf introduced the term "typostrophism." "Typo-" refers to "type," a distinct body plan, meaning a type of animal that undergoes catastrophic (-strophism) changes in development as a new type is being born. It was one thing for a group of paleontologists to claim that the patterns of change revealed by the fossil record called for an orthogenetic evolutionary explanation. It was an entirely different thing to marry such an orthogenetic interpretation of evolutionary change with the results of the rapidly evolving science of genetics. Of the four orthogeneticists here mentioned—Jaekel, Abel, Beurlen, and Schindewolf—the latter was the only one to attempt such a synthesis, which he did in a small book he published in 1936.

Of Fossils and Genes

The late 1920s and early 1930s were difficult times in Germany economically, politically, and socially. Reflecting the general mood of the times, Schindewolf's starting point was his impression that the theory of descent with modification was in a crisis:

Wherever the foundations of secure knowledge seem to be shaky or missing, metaphysical arguments start to spread.... Irrational circumlocutions are replacing well-defined concepts and research questions, without the promise of any valuable scientific insights.... One of the reasons for this unsatisfactory state of affairs is the longstanding antithesis between the theory of descent and genetics. While one should have expected that the two disciplines would come together under a unified theoretical umbrella, they have instead continued to diverge. (1936:iii)

There is perhaps no better illustration of such a schism between the sciences of paleontology and genetics than the famous standoff between paleontologists and geneticists on September 8, 1929, in the university town of Tübingen, near Stuttgart, Germany. In that year, the Paläontologische Gesellschaft and the German Genetics Society held their annual meetings concurrently, with one afternoon being devoted to a joint meeting and discussion. On that afternoon on September 8, the prevailing paleontological perspective was articulated by Franz Weidenreich (1873–1948), a comparative anatomist and physical anthropologist who, after having worked in several German universities, later in his life went to Beijing, China, and subsequently to New York, where he died. Weidenreich had made his first appearance in the circle of the Paläontologische Gesellschaft at its annual meeting—again in Tübingen—in 1922, where his exposition of his understanding of evolutionary transformations of the foot in the evolutionary lineage leading from quadruped primates to bipedal humans was warmly, indeed enthusiastically, received by the audience, especially by Viennese professor of paleobiology Othenio Abel. The point made by Weidenreich that garnered the greatest applause was his tearing down the impermeable wall that August Weismann had erected between the bodily organs and functions (soma) and the genome (germ line). Tearing down this barrier opened up an avenue for acquired characters to become inscribed in the genes. Every trait that today is encoded in the genotype must once have been a trait of the phenotype, was his slogan—one quickly adopted by Abel—again cementing the view that function shapes form, and not the other way around. His other commitment that earned him high praise was his holistic conception of the organisms: cells, organ, and organ systems were, in his view, developmentally as well as functionally tightly integrated and interdependent—a view that diametrically opposed the atomistic conception of an organism so characteristic of Darwinism. There was no evolutionary tinkering possible, in his view. Instead, a concerted transformation of the whole organism had to happen, in response to changing behavior and within the norm of reaction coded for by the genome. Genes, in his view, did not—one by one—determine specific characteristics of organisms. Instead, he thought that genes determined a norm of reaction, i.e., a degree of developmental plasticity, and hence a concomitant potential for change of an organism in response to environmental stimulations. In the evolutionary lineage leading to humans, for example, one could think of changes in behavior that gradually moved away from a quadrupedal stance toward a bipedal stance. Such stepwise building of a preference for bipedal locomotion would have caused changes in the loading patterns in the foot, to which both the skeleton and the muscles would adapt in concert. The consequences of such complex adaptive transformations, triggered by changes in behavioral preferences, would eventually get inscribed in the genes. That, of course, is neo-Lamarckism, pure and simple.

In his presentation at the 1929 joint meeting of German paleontologists and geneticists, Weidenreich again attacked the Weismannian dogma that genes are hermetically sealed off from environmental influence. Defending the "frowned upon 'Lamarckian tendencies'" in evolutionary theory against the geneticists, he pointed to the insufficient duration of mutation experiments pursued by geneticists in their labs with plants and fruit flies, so that long-term consequences remained unknown. He further highlighted the fact that experimentally induced mutations (e.g., by exposing fruit flies to elevated temperatures) only resulted in the variation of minor characters, never in any more fundamental transformation of the body plan. Only if geneticists were ready to soften their dogmatic position with respect to the Weismann doctrine would there be any chance to "terminate this exasperating state of affairs, where two disciplines keep talking past each other, when their coming together would be of greatest importance for a fruitful collaboration concerning the very foundations of biology" (Weidenreich, 1929:286). Weidenreich's presentation was answered by Finnish geneticist (and eugenicist) Harry Federley (1879–1951), who at that time worked in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem. Eugenicists of the time, developing a program of racial hygiene, had ideological reasons to reject neo-Lamarckism. If there were a way in which environmental stimulation could modify the genotype, then there would be at least a potential to remedy alleged genetic defects. But if the Weismannian barrier completely shielded the genotype from environmental influences, any individual would be hostage to its genes, and through them inexorably tied to alleged genetic defects, as much as to whatever were thought to be genetically determined racial traits. From a geneticist's point of view, Federley declared the question of the inheritance of acquired characters to be merely of historical significance. It is the fertilized egg that forms the organism, not the other way around. In that developmental process, however, any particular trait of the organism can be conditioned by several genes, with these possibly even located on different chromosomes (a phenomenon referred to as polygenic inheritance), whereas any given gene can contribute to the development of several organs or organ systems (a phenomenon referred to as pleiotropy). Even if it were possible, there is no simple way to imprint changes of organic form due to environmental influences onto the genome. Federley located neo-Lamarckists primarily among paleontologists, with Othenio Abel and Karl Beurlen as prime examples, whose science—the study of the fossil record—he called an historical one. This he contrasted with genetics, which he classified as a precise and experimental science whose conclusions can be formulated in the language of mathematical statistics. This precise science delivers no proof for the inheritance of acquired characters but instead provides a host of facts speaking against such possibility. Although Federley expressed his understanding for paleontologists who took recourse to Lamarckian explanations in their attempt to forge evolutionary links between the different body plans that were in existence at different times of the earth's geologic past, he urged, "We geneticists... would only wish that those paleontologists who tackle evolutionary questions would endorse the secure insights of genetics, even if these appear inconvenient" (1929:297).

The chairman of the joint session, geologist and paleontologist Josef F. Pompeckj (1867–1930), concluded the ensuing discussion of the two presentations with an expression of hope that the event would result in a rapprochement of the two sciences, paleontology and genetics. Given that both disciplines investigate evolution, it should be possible to find common ground after all, and to jointly aspire to a unified explanation for the evolutionary transformation of body plans. Such a unification, or synthesis, is exactly what Otto Schindewolf aspired to deliver with his book of 1936 on _Paleontology, the Theory of Descent, and Genetics_. In his attempt to bridge the perceived gap between the theory of descent and genetics, Schindewolf attributed foundational importance to paleontology over genetics. Paleontology alone can access, in the fossil record, the only direct evidence that is available for descent with modification through deep time.

Schindewolf followed in that respect the widely read and highly influential book on the theory of descent that was published by Tschulok in 1922. Sinai (Samuel) Tschulok (1875–1945), a native of the Ukraine, arrived with his parents in Zurich in March 1894 as part of the first immigration wave of Eastern Jews into Switzerland. After his graduation from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Tschulok founded a private grammar school, but he also taught a course on evolution at the University of Zurich. The lecture notes for that course served as the basis for his 1922 book. With regard to evolution, Tschulok argued, there are three questions to be asked. Of those, the first and principal question is, did evolution occur? If that question is answered in the affirmative, i.e., if it is agreed that evolution did indeed occur, then two subordinated questions obtain. The first one of those is, how did evolution occur, i.e., what is the shape of the tree of life? The second subordinated question is, why did evolution occur, i.e., what are the mechanisms that drive evolutionary change? Paleontology, Schindewolf argued, falls under the first and genetics under the second of those subordinate questions. The study of fossils, he claimed, provides evidence for patterns of evolutionary change through time. The task of genetics is to help explain those patterns of change as recovered by paleontological research. The patterns Schindewolf believed to have discovered in the fossil record were largely those already described by Jaekel: orthogenesis, where major evolutionary lineages that represent a distinct body plan cycle through stages of origination, youthful diversification, adolescent fine-tuning, adulthood, senescence, and death. The second salient point documented by the fossil record was, in his opinion, the discontinuous, indeed saltational, origin of new body plans. A new body plan is established through the reshaping and repatterning, indeed through the entire reprogramming of early embryonic development, a process Schindewolf called proterogenesis. It is because of the saltational—or as Schindewolf often put it, explosive—origin of new body plans that intermediate forms linking the ancestral and descendant body plan with each other are absent in the fossil record: "As has repeatedly and aptly been said: 'the first bird hatched from a reptile egg'" (Schindewolf, 1936:59). Among the authors who had endorsed such typostrophism, Schindewolf of course listed fellow paleontologists, as well as embryologists, but he listed only one geneticist: Richard Goldschmidt (1878–1958), the father of the idea of hopeful monsters (of whom much more later). Schindewolf found the major as yet unsolved problem of genetics to be the explanation of such saltational evolutionary change, and in that respect, he found Darwinism (the theory of gradual change through random variation and natural selection) insufficient and neo-Lamarckism (function determining form through the inscription of acquired characters into genes) downright wrong. It is against this background that Schindewolf found Goldschmidt's investigations into the genetic basis of embryonic development so important. Starting from a fertilized egg, i.e., a single cell, any given body plan is progressively more and more determined and structured the further embryonic development proceeds, until it reaches its full differentiation. It is thus unlikely that a new body plan can evolve from an ancestral one during late developmental stages, at a time when the ancestral body plan is already nearly, or fully, realized. Conversely, and as Goldschmidt had argued, mutations that affect early embryonic stages can have a major effect through redirecting subsequent developmental pathways. Schindewolf concluded, "The origin of a new body plan is thus due to the influence of mutations on early ontogenetic stages" (1936:87). The job of fine-tuning a newly originated body plan with respect to the environmental intricacies can then be left to Darwinian variation and natural selection. The origin of new species of the same body plan can thus be explained exactly along the lines Darwin had argued. The origin of a new body plan cannot be so explained, however, as it requires different mechanisms that have more profound effects on evolutionary transformation. Schindewolf, like Jaekel before him, thus recognized two levels of evolutionary transformation, and with them two different mechanisms of evolution.

The way Schindewolf married the results of paleontological research with genetics merits more discussion, however. Against neo-Lamarckians, Schindewolf insisted that "paleontology and the theory of descent will have to recognize and incorporate the laws of genetics that have been discovered through meticulous experimental research as being correct and binding, unless they are called into question by decisive, truly evidential findings" (1936:85). But what did Schindewolf recognize as those secure laws of contemporary genetics? One was the claim that there are no other known mechanisms driving evolutionary transformation than mutations, their combination, their recombination through sexual reproduction, and subsequent selection among viable combinations of mutations. Second, mutations are random and not directional. Third, and most importantly, "The transformation and evolution of organisms occurs in leaps, through sudden, more or less large mutational steps, which are caused by changes in the genes and the genome" (1936:85). There is the rub: more or less large mutations. Weidenreich, in his 1929 address, had argued that experimental genetics had so far revealed mutations that affected organisms in minor traits only, such as the color pattern on the wings of butterflies or the color of the eye in the fruit fly _Drosophila_. Experimental genetics as it stood at that time, he claimed, could therefore not explain the origin of major, discrete body plans. Schindewolf, for his part, thought that the fossil record unequivocally documented the saltational, indeed explosive, origin of new body plans. Given that he thought this to be a well-established fact, he borrowed the notion of mutation from experimental genetics, but, going beyond experimental results available at the time, he added the qualifier that these mutations could be minor or major ones. This is where he called on Goldschmidt for support of his conclusion—but Goldschmidt was an outspoken critic of contemporary experimental genetics.

1. To translate Paläontologische Gesellschaft as "German Paleontological Society" would be misleading because the society was renamed Deutsche Paläontologische Gesellschaft during the Nazi regime to signal its falling in line with Nazi ideology. The society returned to its old name, Paläontologische Gesellschaft, when it reconstituted itself after World War II.

A Monk in His Garden

GREGOR WAS NOT HIS ORIGINAL NAME. HE WAS GIVEN THAT NAME when, in 1843, he decided to become a priest and Augustinian monk at the Abbey of St. Thomas in Brünn (today Brno) in Moravia, then part of the Habsburg Austrian-Hungarian empire, now located in the Czech Republic. He was born on July 22, 1822, to Anton and Rosine Mendel, who baptized him Johann. They were a German couple running a farm in Silesia, at that time also part of Austria-Hungary. Johann (later Gregor) Mendel's student years, which ultimately took him to the University of Vienna, saw him excel in mathematics and physics. However, he also took a course from Franz Joseph Andreas Nicolaus Unger (1800–1870), a medical doctor, botanist, and cofounder of the science of paleobotany (the study of fossil plants), who taught first at the University of Graz and later at the University of Vienna. Having been raised in a rural setting, Gregor Mendel was intimately familiar with the significance of crop selection and livestock breeding (for a short biography, see <http://www.biography.com/people/gregor-mendel-39282?page=1>, accessed June 21, 2016). His later experiments with pea plants in the gardens of the Abbey of St. Thomas may very well have been influenced by Unger, who had developed an evolutionary theory he published in 1852, seven years before Darwin's epoch-making _Origin_. In the "Historical Sketch" included in the third edition of the _Origin_ , published in 1861, Darwin praised Unger as the "celebrated botanist and paleontologist" who had "published... his belief that species undergo development and modification" (1861:xix; see also Temkin, 1959:339). Unger's evolutionary theory was, however, much more romantic than Darwin's materialistic and mechanistic outlook.

Looking back on the period of German Romanticism—personified by such luminaries as philosopher Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854) and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832)—Unger introduced the notion of a creative force active within organisms, driving plants toward diversification and perfection, in a course parallel to the animal kingdom, which reached its pinnacle of perfection with the emergence of humans. The motivation for such evolutionary thought was grounded in the philosophical background of German Romanticism, which understood nature—indeed the whole world—as an immense organism subject to continuous change, a dynamic complex whole that in its entirety is more than the mere sum of its parts. In Schelling's terms, the whole of nature was not only begotten but was continuously begetting, thus sustaining a creative process that cast matter into transient forms, such as organisms or species. Thus, in Unger's view, if the world of plants were not tied together through its development in time, driven as it were by a creative force he stipulated to work within the plants, then the multiplicity of plant species and genera would have to be considered a mere aggregate rather than an integrated complex whole composed of interdependent parts, i.e., a thriving superorganism: "In one word, each newly originating plant species cannot be the result of the interaction of external forces, but must be rooted in the synergistic effect of those already organized forces that we recognize in the world of plants—one species of plant must originate from another" (1852:344). Thus, the entire plant kingdom can be understood as a whole, "a truly integrated organism" (1852:345; see also Temkin, 1959:340; Gliboff, 1998:181).

According to eminent evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, Mendel set out to test Unger's theory. He approached the question of plant species originating from one another through hybridization experiments using pea plants (Mayr, 1982:711). The great botanist Linnaeus, the founder of biological classification and nomenclature whom we met in chapter 2, had already suggested that hybridization might give rise to new species within the same genus of plants. So Mendel could claim to be in good company when tackling such a heretical question. In crossbreeding pea plants, Mendel discovered that the offspring did not display a blending of parental characters in a random pattern. Instead, he found that discrete traits of either parent plant were transmitted to the offspring in a highly regular, seemingly lawlike pattern that could be described in mathematical terms. Through this work, Mendel established himself as the father of genetics. In 1865, he presented his results in two talks delivered at the February and March meetings of the Natural History Society of Brünn, after which his findings were published in the proceedings volume issued by that society in 1866. But if anybody read it, its revolutionary significance was not recognized. The proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn were sent to "115 or more institutions," and "Mendel had forty reprints made of his paper," one of which he sent to eminent Swiss botanist Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli (1817–1891), who at that time was teaching at the University of Munich (Mayr, 1982:723). Already by 1856 Nägeli had endorsed the idea of "the origin of a new species from a vanishing one," but since his own views on inheritance differed profoundly from Mendel's theory, he chose to ignore Mendel's paper: "To accept Mendel's theory would have meant, for Nägeli, a complete refutation of his own" (Nägeli 1856:203; Mayr, 1982:723). It would take until the year 1900 for Mendel's laws of inheritance to be rediscovered independently by three people: Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries (1848–1935), from the University of Amsterdam; German botanist Carl Correns (1864–1933), a student of Carl Nägeli's and the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem; and Austrian agronomist Erich Tschermak (1871–1962), from the University of Vienna. Their publications from the spring of 1900 ushered in a new era of biology that saw the rapid development of research in genetics.

Vigorous genetic research programs sprung up on both sides of the Atlantic, involving both plant and animal model organisms. Some of the central questions asked and answered included, what is the material basis of heritable traits? Where in the cell is this material located? How is it transmitted to the offspring? It was perhaps Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866–1945) and his students and collaborators who most aggressively pursued a Mendelian program in their genetic research at Columbia University in New York, famously using the fruit fly _Drosophila_ as a model organism. In 1933, Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for his discoveries concerning the role that the chromosomes play in the transmission of hereditary traits. Morgan's philosophy was that of a sober scientist, strictly focusing on questions that—given the instrumental means available at the time—could be answered through experimental research: what is the material basis of hereditary traits, and what are the mechanisms that transmit those to offspring? A milestone had been reached by 1915, the year Morgan and his students published their landmark volume _The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity_. With this publication, the chromosome theory became firmly married to the Mendelian laws. This theory identified chromosomes as the material basis of heritable traits or factors. These factors, which came to be known as genes, were proven to be stable as they were transmitted to the offspring, except for those that had undergone a mutation. Finally, these Mendelian genes were found to be arranged in a linear pattern on the chromosomes, the latter located in the cell's nucleus. The chromosome thus came to be viewed as a string of genes, and the gene was understood as a bit of a chromosome—a material particle, a discrete unit. The genes would be aligned on a chromosome like beads in a necklace. It is this conception of the genes, in conjunction with the behavior of the chromosomes first in the formation of egg and sperm cells, then in the process of fertilization during which egg and sperm cells fuse, that provided a materialistic and mechanistic explanation of the Mendelian laws of heredity (Allen, 1974a:62).

This, of course, was not the end of the story, as we certainly know from modern science. There was not yet any talk of DNA, whose structure was identified only in 1953, opening the door to the rapid ascent of molecular genetics as the queen of the biological sciences. Earlier in the twentieth century, however, two issues were prominent in genetics, one scientific and the other philosophical. The scientific debate turned on the dominance of the cell nucleus and its chromosomes, as opposed to the cell plasma and its organelles, in heredity. Was it the nucleus and its chromosomes that dominated the transmission of hereditary traits to the offspring, or was the hereditary constitution of the offspring more shaped by the cell plasma and its organelles? It was that debate, one vigorously pursued among German geneticists in particular, that famously pitched the _Genom_ against the _Plasmon_. The philosophical debate sprung up against the background of modern physics, which by the early twentieth century, under Ernst Mach's and Albert Einstein's leadership, had boldly replaced matter by energy in its explanatory strategy. In modern physics, matter dissolved into energy, substance into processes. The electron was no longer conceived of as a tiny lump of matter but rather as a pulse of energy taking part in events. Could not a similar explanatory strategy prove fruitful in genetics—one that replaced a material, corpuscular conception with a dynamic, functional conception of genes?

Mutation Theory: Micro- and Macroevolution

Researchers investigating fossils, comparative anatomy, and comparative embryology faced a whole catalog of questions in the early twentieth century. Species and their populations are subject to all-pervading variation, an observation that contrasts with the persistence of major body plans through geological time. The variations that affect species and their populations generally affect minor characters that appear late during embryonic development, an observation that contrasts with the recognition that major body plans are generally laid down during early phases of embryonic development. The newly discovered Mendelian genes could seamlessly be wedded to the insights gained through the study of the geographic variation of species and their populations. But that said nothing about how those genes that obey Mendel's laws relate to the evolution of major body plans, let alone the origin of a new body plan from an ancestral one. At least most paleontologists were happy to entertain the idea that there are two levels of evolutionary change, and correspondingly two different mechanisms of evolutionary transformation. The lower level is that of the species and its populations, and the higher level is that of major evolutionary lineages that represent discrete body plans. It was Russian zoologist and geneticist Jurij Philiptschenko (1882–1930) who—in a small book published in 1927—introduced the terms "microevolution" and "macroevolution" to characterize these two levels of evolutionary change. In so doing, Philiptschenko—a sympathizer of the orthogenetic models of evolution discussed in the previous chapter—started out by contrasting genetics, the study of patterns of inheritance, with phylogenetics, the study of evolutionary relationships (Junker, 2004:354). Like others before him, he declared these two sciences to be unequal. Genetics he declared to be an exact, experimental science, as opposed to phylogenetics, which he considered a highly speculative, historical science. To back up this claim, he cited the perhaps most prominent experimental embryologist and biophilosopher of the time, Hans Driesch (1867–1941), who had said that "the theory of descent is the hypothetical statement that the organisms are really allied by blood among each other, in spite of their diversities" (Driesch, 1908:251; cited in Philiptschenko, 1927:83).

In Philiptschenko's understanding, the contrast between experimentation in genetics and speculation in phylogenetics opened an asymmetry between the two sciences. He insisted that the geneticist could—indeed should—study his pea or maize plants, fruit flies, or butterflies completely independently of evolutionary theory. In contrast, the phylogeneticist, he argued, could not afford to ignore the insights of genetics as he or she goes about deciphering evolutionary relationships. Microevolution, the study of evolutionary processes at the level of species and their populations, can easily be tied to the genetic "factors that we know about today. These are primarily mutations, their combination, and natural selection" (Philiptschenko, 1927:90). What at the time was branded as the neo-Darwinian doctrine—or dogma—was the claim that all evolutionary processes, including macroevolution (i.e., the origin of new body plans), can be explained as a summation of such microevolutionary processes. Philiptschenko himself rejected that claim. The characters that mark out major body plans that characterize higher systematic categories, such as classes or phyla (i.e., echinoderms, mollusks, or turtles), differ from the characters that demarcate species and their populations in several ways, he claimed: first by their invariance and stability. Here Philiptschenko again cited famed botanist Carl Nägeli, who had claimed that "the essence of a taxonomic unit lies not in its characters, but in the latter's degree of constancy" (Philiptschenko, 1927:92; Nägeli, 1884:281). That is to say, whereas species fluctuate through time due to continuous variation and natural selection, traits that mark out major evolutionary lineages, such as the coiled shell of snails or the carapace of turtles, are conserved through million of years, as documented by the fossil record. Next, Philiptschenko invoked the great ninteenth-century comparative embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer, who had shown that characters that mark out major taxonomic groups, or corresponding body plans, develop early during embryogenesis, while the characters that mark out species and their populations develop last (Philiptschenko, 1927:92; Baer, 1828:225). Finally, he made the point that it is quite well established that species-specific characters are determined by genes that obey Mendel's laws, whereas it has not been possible to demonstrate a link between Mendelian genes and the characters of either major taxonomic groups or early embryonic stages. This, to him, indicated that macroevolution could not (yet) be explained by the findings of modern genetics, concerned as it was with the chromosomes, the genes aligned on them, and Mendelian patterns of inheritance. His conclusion was that it is perhaps the cell plasma (the _Plasmon_ as opposed to the _Genom_ ) that is instead responsible for the organization of early developmental stages after all (Philiptschenko, 1927:93ff.).

In light of these discussions, it became obvious that the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships in essence boils down to the study of the evolutionary transformation of characters, i.e., of those characters that mark out taxonomic groups. Species and their populations (subspecies) are the lowest taxonomic units, and classes and phyla are the highest taxonomic units, the latter marked out by fundamentally different body plans. The distinction of micro- versus macroevolution minimally implies the possibility that characters that mark out taxonomic units of lower or higher rank may be subject to different evolutionary mechanisms. Given such a research agenda, it becomes clear that whereas genetic research might indeed proceed independently from paleontology, genetics could not declare independence from taxonomy. It was the taxonomist who told the geneticist what a species is, and whether any two or more of its populations deserved to be recognized as separate subspecies. It was such input from the expert taxonomist that informed the geneticist whether the patterns of inheritance he or she was studying held at the species level or below, i.e., at the level of subspecies.

Therein lay precisely the conundrum: if Darwin's theory was right, then there could be no real species out there in nature. The title of his famous 1859 book was _On the Origin of Species_ , yet in it, Darwin nonchalantly declared: "I look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other" (1859:52). The reasons for such a surprising conclusion were the twin mechanisms of evolution he invoked: random variation and natural selection. Evolutionary transformation occurs as a continuous gradual process that plays out along the chain of successive generations, necessarily robbing species of sharp boundaries. Darwin's theory rendered the transition from an ancestral to a descendant species a fuzzy one. Where would one species end and another begin? In the wake of the rediscovery of Mendelian laws and the subsequent blossoming of genetics, there sprung up a vivid interest in the question of species delimitation on both sides of the Atlantic. One of the important voices in North America that was also heard in Europe belonged to entomologist Alfred C. Kinsey (1894–1965), who studied the taxonomy and distribution of gall wasps. Later in life, Kinsey would through the Kinsey Reports make a name for himself as America's first sexologist. On species and their demarcation, Kinsey the entomologist had the following to say: "[The species is] the unit beneath which there are in nature no subdivisions which maintain themselves for any length of time or over any large area.... It is the unit directly involved with the origin of species" (1937:207).

Bernhard Rensch (1900–1990) was a prominent German zoologist whose investigations into species-level evolution earned him the accolade of having been the most important European contributor to the modern synthesis that merged Darwinian evolutionary theory with population genetics, which otherwise developed mostly in the United States in the mid-twentieth century. Rensch found that what Kinsey called species most European biologists would call geographic races, or subspecies. Indeed, early twentieth-century investigations of species origins focused on the fact that most species, certainly those with a wide geographic distribution, were composed of a number of at least partially isolated populations that could be recognized as being at least somewhat different from one another. It was soon recognized that such geographically isolated populations represent the cradle for the origin of new species. Such a conclusion certainly corresponded well to Darwin's earlier statement: "Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species" (1859:52). The work on the dynamics of evolutionary processes at the level species and their populations (potential subspecies) that was most important with respect to the theory of hopeful monsters was probably pursued in Germany before World War II, with Rensch and his academic mentor, Erwin Stresemann (1889–1972), representing only two of many outstanding scholars active in this field. Another was Adolf Remane (1898–1976). In their work on speciation—the origin of a new species from an ancestral one—these three authors all at one point or another referred back to influential self-taught ornithologist Otto Kleinschmidt (1870–1954). Kleinschmidt has been characterized as a "leading ornithologist, protestant pastor, creationist and sometime Nazi sympathizer" (Williams, 2006:4). The reason that evolutionary biologists such as those just mentioned would refer back to a creationist was Kleinschmidt's _Formenkreis_ theory.

Kleinschmidt did not subscribe to evolutionary theory; for him, every species had been separately created. On that account, species have sharp boundaries, not the fuzzy boundaries of Darwinian evolution. There is no gradual transition between an ancestral and a descendant species possible. However, as an avid birder, Kleinschmidt realized that species are structured in terms of geographically vicariant populations, which to a greater or lesser degree may differ from one another, often justifying the recognition of geographic races, today called subspecies. Kleinschmidt recognized these geographic races as different forms of one and the same species. The species as a whole is thus composed of a number of such forms, i.e., it becomes a _Formenkreis_ (group of forms). Erwin Stresemann from the Berlin Museum of Natural History, possibly Germany's most eminent and influential ornithologist of the twentieth century, took up Kleinschmidt's concept of a _Formenkreis_ , but he embedded it in an evolutionary context. Pictured from that perspective, the geographic race, or subspecies, became the point of departure for the origin of a new species. A subspecies was thus understood as a potential incipient new species. It was, however, Bernhard Rensch from the University of Münster who made these ideas the foundation of a research program that attracted much attention—and applause—on both sides of the Atlantic. What Kleinschmidt had called a _Formenkreis_ , Rensch at the International Ornithological Congress, held in Copenhagen in 1926, dubbed a _Rassenkreis_. A _Rassenkreis_ is a species composed of a number of geographic races (subspecies), each adapted to the environment of its specific geographic location. Just as a single population is composed of variable individual organisms, so is a species composed of diversely adapted geographic races (subspecies). And it is from such geographic races that the process of speciation that leads to the origin of a new species takes its beginning. The precondition for such speciation to take place, however, is the effective genetic isolation of a geographic race from all other populations (subspecies) of the same species. Because the gene pool of such an isolated geographic race is reproductively isolated from other populations of its species, it acquires the potential to embark on a new evolutionary trajectory, driven by mutation and recombination of Mendelian genes on the one hand and natural selection on the other. Such population-level processes of species origination could be brought into complete accordance with the insights provided by Mendelian genetics of the time (Rensch, 1933).

Early in his career, however, Rensch adapted a neo-Lamarckian argumentation scheme. The geographic races of wide-ranging species he often found to exhibit a gradient in their local adaptations, mirroring a gradient prevalent in environmental conditions. An example would be a gradient apparent in the local adaptations of a string of local populations that corresponds to a gradual change of climatic conditions encountered by a species with a distribution that ranges from the far North to the Deep South. Such a graded pattern of geographic variation is, for example, captured by Bergmann's rule—one much discussed by Rensch—which states that body size in populations of the same species increases with colder climate or higher latitude. How could such a gradient of local adaptations of populations within a species be explained if mutations are purely random and the genetic code is completely shielded from the environment? Initially, Rensch accepted the first but not the second of these premises, arguing that the environment can influence genes. While still a scientific assistant at the Berlin Museum of Natural History, Rensch in 1934 laid out these ideas about species formation in a public exhibit at the museum, which got him into serious trouble with Nazi authorities (Rensch, 1979:770ff.; see also Junker, 2001). Some Nazi ideologues, especially those engaged in racial hygiene, waged a merciless campaign against neo-Lamarckism because the latter doctrine would allow—indeed promote—the adaptation of non-Aryan races not only to the Aryan landscape but also to Aryan culture. That threatened to jeopardize the argument for a superiority of the Aryan race and to invalidate the Darwinian (in this case, social Darwinian) foundation that was called on in support of the pseudoscience of racial hygiene. Later in life, however, Rensch turned to neo-Darwinism pure and simple, endorsing the idea that all macroevolutionary phenomena could seamlessly be reduced to microevolutionary, i.e., population-level, processes fueled by the mutation and recombination of Mendelian genes (Rensch, 1980).

Adolf Remane wanted to exercise greater caution in regard to such sweeping conclusions. Unlike Rensch, he was not part of the Stresemann school in Berlin; he worked at the University of Kiel under the tutelage of the famous freshwater ecologist August Thienemann (1882–1960). In 1927, Remane published an influential paper on _Species and Race_. For a zoologist, this is an uncompromising title; among anthropologists studying human races and societies, such a title might raise eyebrows, especially after World War II. The compromising thing was that Remane published his article not in a zoological or biological journal but in a journal of physical anthropology, which shows how at the time zoological studies on race formation informed corresponding research in physical anthropology. In his 1927 paper, Remane did indeed discuss the nature of plant, animal, and human races in a reciprocally illuminating context, but without ideological connotations. Still, according to his son, Jürgen Remane (1934–2004), this paper landed his father in British detainment in 1945 for almost a year and earned him the classification as fellow traveler during the denazification campaign (Remane, 2003). The truth is that Adolf Remane—as did his mentor, Thienemann—paid lip service to Nazi biopolitics in several other, later publications (Rieppel, 2013a). Honoring an invitation to contribute, Remane published one particularly incriminating piece on race formation in 1941 in the _Archiv für Rassenund Gesellschaftsbiologie_ (Archive for racial and social biology), a journal dedicated to eugenics and racial hygiene edited by the former Weismann student and leading German eugenicist Fritz Lenz (1887–1976), and published by racist and Nazi sympathizer J. F. Lehmann, a publisher in Munich. Having been involved in the drafting of Nazi legislation concerning racial hygiene, Lenz claimed after the war that although he stayed on as a member of the editorial board of the _Archiv_ , he no longer exerted any influence in shaping the content of the journal after 1933.1 As unlikely as this sounds, it was nevertheless probably another member of the editorial board who invited Remane's contribution, Gerhard Heberer (1901–1973), a Nazi sympathizer and the leading synthesizer of the work pursued by German evolutionary biologists (Hoßfeld, 1997).

Remane never endorsed neo-Lamarckism, the idea that acquired characters could become heritable. He again argued that in the Darwinian account of evolution, a species does not have sharp boundaries. In his 1927 paper, his first on that topic, he therefore declared a species definition making reference to physical characters that mark out a species, such as those indicated in an illustrated field guide, for example, to be impossible; only a physiological definition of species is possible, namely in terms of a reproductive community. The consequence of such a definition of a species as a reproductive community anchors the nature of any given species in its gene pool, more so than in the physical appearance of individual organisms, Remane contended. Other relevant factors that condition the nature of a species, and that of its geographic races, are the geographical and ecological settings in which they occur. In this early paper, Remane did not address issues of micro- versus macroevolution, nor how these would relate to the insights of contemporary experimental genetics. In 1937, the year he joined the NSDAP, Remane published another paper on animal race formation, once again emphasizing the difficulties that frequently obtain in distinguishing a species from geographic races or subspecies, adding that these distinctions, as drawn by taxonomists, often entail an element of arbitrariness. (On Remane's affiliation with the NSDAP, see Zachos and Hoßfeld, 2006:318.) While this again emphasized the idea that geographic races, or subspecies, are the starting point for the origin of a new species, it was not until 1939 that Remane finally addressed the issue as to how these microevolutionary processes compared to macroevolutionary transformations, and how either of those related to contemporary genetics. Remane was almost uniquely qualified to do so, as his research covered an exceptional range of organisms, including a wide variety of invertebrates through vertebrates all the way to fossil hominids. He had also written, and would continue to do so, entries on many invertebrate phyla for a German encyclopedia of biology, the _Handbuch der Biologie_ , and was thus intimately acquainted with the difficulties involved in explaining the origin and evolutionary transformation of major body plans, such as sponges, worms, or jellyfish. In addition to his encyclopedic taxonomic expertise, he also pursued deep interests in comparative anatomy and embryonic development. He wrote on the origin of segmentation in such invertebrates as annelid worms, as well as about the evolution of the vertebral column and its associated organs.

In his 1939 paper on the significance of the modern mutation theory, Remane, like Schindewolf before him, again referred back to the three distinctions drawn by the Zurich biotheoretician Sinai Tschulok (discussed in the previous chapter): did evolution occur, and if so, how, and why, did it occur? Mutation theory, Remane concluded, falls under the last of these three questions, i.e., the question about the causal mechanisms that drive evolutionary transformation. Going from there, Remane emphasized the experimental nature of modern genetics, from which he derived an important distinction. In his paper, he argued, he would only discuss what he called real mutations, i.e., mutations of the kind that had been revealed through experimentation. He would not countenance so-called desktop mutations (I would have called them armchair mutations), i.e., hypothetical mutations that geneticists invoked as hypothetical explanatory devices while sitting at their desk, instead of running experiments. The experimental nature of modern genetics Remane then contrasted with the historical nature of evolutionary studies. Nevertheless, he thought that there was a possibility to have the two research programs reciprocally illuminate each other. The comparative anatomist and paleontologist, he contended, often find evolutionary transformations in different groups of organisms to independently follow similar trends. This means that patterns, or types, of phylogenetic transformations could be identified. Geneticists, he claimed, similarly find that mutations follow a certain set of patterns, such that it should be possible to compare types of evolutionary patterns with types of mutational patterns in an effort to find some overlap, or congruence, between them. Should such congruence obtain, then and only then would he be willing to accept the insights gleaned from genetics as an explanation for the corresponding evolutionary change. The two phylogenetic patterns that he then proceeded to test against the current theories of genetics were the understanding of a species as a composite of geographic races, as opposed to the evolutionary transformation of complex, functionally integrated organic systems such as major body plans. His conclusions are hardly surprising. The real mutations known from experimental genetics do indeed explain how a species comes to be structured as a complex of geographic races, or subspecies, as it expands its geographic distribution. But in his view, experimental genetics had not yet succeeded in documenting the kind of mutation that would explain the transformation of functionally integrated complex organic systems such as major body plans. Refraining from the invocation of desktop mutations, he declared ignorance with respect to the explanation of such macroevolutionary events while at the same time banning neo-Lamarckian tendencies from any consideration.

The father of the doctrine of hopeful monsters would not exert the same degree of caution in scientific theory construction.

A German Jew in America

Richard Benedict Goldschmidt came, as he himself put it, "from an old German-Jewish family" (Stern, 1967:172; for a review of Goldschmidt's life and work, see Dietrich, 2003). He was born in Frankfurt am Main on April 12, 1878, and died in Berkeley, California, on April 24, 1958. His parents were of high social standing, receiving "well-known scientists, bankers, and philanthropists" at their house for dinner and entertainment (Stern, 1967:141ff.). In Goldschmidt's own words, his was "a typical German bourgeois family, comfortable but strict and even parsimonious in spite of cooks, nursemaids and French governesses" (Stern, 1967:142). Later in life, he reminisced about the antisemitic mobbing he experienced in the streets of his hometown and at school. As was typical for members of his social class in Germany, Richard enjoyed a broad, classical education in the ancient languages of Latin and Greek as well as in the humanities, arts, and sciences. "Music is still to me what religion is to the believer," Goldschmidt once said later in his life (Stern, 1967:172). He played the violin and viola, all the while excelling in sports, and grew up to become an aficionado of Far Eastern arts. Acquaintance with the works of Goethe was de rigueur in the social circles known as the _Bildungsbürgertum_ , as was the study of philosophical luminaries "from Spinoza to Nietzsche" (Stern, 1967:142).

At his parent's request, he enrolled in medical school at the University of Heidelberg. What is important for a proper understanding of his later theorizing in genetics is the fact that as a medical student, Goldschmidt took classes from the most illustrious comparative anatomist of his time, Carl Gegenbaur (1826–1903), who had transferred from Jena University to Heidelberg in 1873. Gegenbaur imbued the young medical student with a deep sense of appreciation for the organization of the major body plans that mark out higher taxonomic units, such as mollusks, arthropods, and vertebrates. In the Gegenbaur school, such body plans were referred to as types of organization: turtles and birds are clearly different types of organization within vertebrates. At the outset of his academic career, while still a professor in Jena, Gegenbaur held these types as having been designed by the Creator. Gegenbaur was instrumental in bringing the young Ernst Haeckel to the University of Jena, where a deep friendship blossomed between the two men (Richards, 2008:80ff.). Ernst Haeckel immediately caught the Darwinian bug when he read the German translation of Darwin's _Origin_ , published by the paleontologist Heinrich Bronn (1800–1862) in 1860 (Gliboff, 2008). Soon Haeckel had managed to infect his friend Gegenbaur with that same bug. The two embarked on a joint project, which was to render comparative anatomy into what they called a true science "through its infusion with evolutionary meaning" (Nyhart, 2003:163; see also Rieppel, 2011). Whereas before comparative anatomy strove to sketch the ideal, i.e., purely conceptual, derivation of one body plan from another through a series of imagined intermediate stages, it now attempted to understand the origin and transformation of body plans in evolutionary terms. Once again, both Haeckel and Gegenbaur sought answers to questions that arose from the comparison of radically different body plans—and their evolutionary derivation from one another—in early stages of embryonic development. Given their state of lesser differentiation and determination, it was again early stages of embryonic development that seemed to hold the key to an understanding of the origin of a new body plan from an ancestral one.

After some semesters in Heidelberg, Goldschmidt decided to transfer to the University of Munich to study zoology under former Haeckel student Richard Hertwig (1850–1937), "with minors in botany, physiology and paleontology" (Stern, 1967:142). His early research focused on cytology (the study of cellular structures) and comparative anatomy. In 1909, the year he turned to genetics, Goldschmidt became an associate professor at the University of Munich. In 1911, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society was founded (renamed the Max Planck Society after World War II), with the mission to promote science through the establishment of research institutes specializing in various scientific disciplines. The institute that would specialize in biology was built in Berlin-Dahlem; Goldschmidt was appointed as a staff member upon its opening in 1914. The award of a traveling stipend in the same year allowed him to embark on a field trip to Japan. His return to Germany was thwarted by the British blockade of the German coastline at the outset of the Great War, forcing Goldschmidt to pursue breeding experiments as a guest researcher in the United States. He returned to his post in Berlin-Dahlem when the war was over in 1919 to resume his position at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, a post he retained even after the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed two months after Hitler took power on April 7, 1933. While this law banned non-Aryans (as well as opponents of the regime) from tenured positions in the civil service, it was only the Nuremberg laws passed in 1935 that provided supposedly clear and precise definitions of degrees of Jewishness on the basis of parenthood. Once these laws had been enacted, Goldschmidt and his family were harassed and accused of "racial defilement ( _Rassenschande_ )," which drove them out of Germany (Satzinger, 2009:169). Goldschmidt emigrated to the United States, where in 1936 he became a professor in the department of zoology at the University of California at Berkeley. Goldschmidt earned his place in the history of biology as the most outspoken critic of the atomistic and mechanistic approach to genetics exemplified at the highest level of perfection by the Morgan school at Columbia University. Upon his arrival in the United States, Goldschmidt—in his typical confrontational style—announced "in a funereal voice: 'the theory of the gene is—dead'!" (Stern, 1967:165).

Goldschmidt most eloquently fleshed out his theory of hopeful monsters in his 1940 book _The Material Basis of Evolution_. The book resulted from a lecture series he delivered at Yale University, the Mrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman Memorial Lectures, inaugurated in 1833 with the mission to "illustrate the presence and providence, the wisdom and goodness of God, as manifest in the natural and moral world" (Silliman Foundation, introduction to Goldschmidt, 1940). Goldschmidt took this mission statement for a natural scientist to mean "the demonstration of law and order in his chosen field"—in his case, genetics (1940:3). He had already sketched out the basic ideas of his 1940 book in an article published in _Science_ in 1933. This is also the paper in which he first introduced the term "hopeful monster" (1933:547). Goldschmidt was intimately aware of the close ties that link experimental genetics to taxonomy: "I was an ardent coleopterologist," interested in the species-level taxonomy of beetles, he reminisced (1940:27). Kleinschmidt, Stresemann, Rensch, and Remane are all authors copiously quoted in his 1940 treatise, a fact that clearly reveals the German roots of his education and style of thinking. Of these authors, only Rensch made it into the most important book on population genetics published around the same time in North America, Theodosius Dobzhansky's _Genetics and the Origin of Species_ (1937). Goldschmidt himself had a profound knowledge of population genetics. Indeed, he is "recognized as the first person to have investigated the genetics of variation among wild populations" (Harwood, 1993:111). Goldschmidt engaged in an exhaustive analysis of the geographic variation of the gypsy moth, _Lymantria dispar_ : "I was able to make what I believe to be the most complete genetic analysis of a _Rassenkreis_ ," borrowing the latter term from Rensch to designate a group of subspecies that together constitute a species (1933:541). Much to his own horror, Goldschmidt witnessed the co-option of his own genetic research in ideologically charged discussions of racial hygiene by German eugenicists, a development he tried to oppose as best as he could (Satzinger, 2009:167ff.). Goldschmidt defined a _Rassenkreis_ as "a series of typically different forms or subspecies found at different points within the geographic range of a species and often showing a typical order of their characters if arranged geographically" (1933:540). Using his own taxonomic expertise as a foundation, but enriching it with a broad review of the pertinent literature, Goldschmidt proclaimed—against the neo-Darwinian doctrine—that good species do have sharp boundaries after all:

Kleinschmidt... the father of the _Formenkreis_ concept, held that every species was separated from every other by a gap. His intensive studies as an ornithologist of considerable authority, as well as his study of other groups, demonstrated to him that this was the rule. (He was even led to deny an evolution from one species into another, but here the preacher might have influenced the ornithologist.) (1940:143)

If Kleinschmidt's conclusions were tainted by his religious commitment, the same could not be said of Stresemann, whom Goldschmidt considered "one of the leading and most progressive taxonomists" of the time (1940:154). In a paper on Kleinschmidt's _Formenkreis_ theory published in 1936, Stresemann had concluded "that there is really something like natural species, surrounded by sharp structural boundaries" out there in nature (Stresemann, cited in Goldschmidt, 1940:154). All the same, however, Stresemann, like Rensch, had accepted the view that geographic races are incipient species, i.e., that subspecies hold the potential to evolve into new species. For Goldschmidt, who considered species to be separated from one another by a "bridgeless gap," this amounted to idle speculation: "Rensch, who is predominantly an ornithologist, forgets the statements by such leading ornithologists as Kleinschmidt and Stresemann, who recognized the bridgeless gaps [that separate species] and tried to extricate themselves from their dilemma, one by recourse to theology, the other to phylogenetic speculation" (1940:170).

Within his own expertise, as well as in the work of others, Goldschmidt found species to have sharp boundaries—to be separated by a bridgeless gap. He accepted the fact, however, that species are constituted by a variable number of geographic races, or subspecies, each adapted to the specific local circumstances in which it lived. As a geneticist, he of course rejected the neo-Lamarckism countenanced by the young Rensch, which would have allowed local environmental circumstances to influence the gene pool of geographic races in a process of adaptation. Goldschmidt accepted the fact that Mendelian mutations and their recombination through sexual reproduction, not environmental factors, drive the formation of geographic races, but he thought that they do so in a particular way. Mendelian mutations and their recombination would, according to him, preadapt organisms to a new environment. The concept of preadaptation was much discussed at the time and played a central role in Goldschmidt's thinking. With the rejection of neo-Lamarckism, the environment lost its power to modify genes. Genes are modified through mutation and reassorted through sexual reproduction; the consequence is a change of form. Changes in the genotype drive changes in the phenotype, not the other way around. In classical Darwinian terms, the variable phenotypes that result from such genetic modifications then come under the pressure of natural selection. Goldschmidt considered this doctrine an insufficient explanation of how species come to form locally adapted subspecies. He thought that Mendelian mutations and their recombination change the phenotypes in a reproductive community in a way that preadapts these organisms to a new environment. Such preadaptation allows organisms to migrate and spread into a new environment, to create a new ecological niche, and in the end to establish a new subspecies. This is certainly a position that can no longer be defended in modern evolutionary theory. Still, the importance that the concept of preadaptation played in Goldschmidt's theorizing cannot be overstated: Mendelian mutations and their recombination result in variation that preadapts the affected organisms in such a way as to render them capable of invading new environments, thereby expanding the range of a species through the formation of new geographic races (subspecies). This is what, according to Goldschmidt, contemporary experimental genetics contributed to an understanding of evolution—no more, no less.

Microevolutionary processes that play out within a species, i.e., at the level of subspecies, could be illuminated through experimental genetics. It is in microtaxonomy, i.e., taxonomy at and below the level of species, that the taxonomist meets the experimental geneticist. In Goldschmidt's assessment, contemporary genetics as studied in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab had not yet contributed anything to macrotaxonomy, i.e., to an understanding of the origin of new discrete species, let alone to an understanding of the origin of new body plans (Goldschmidt, 1940:5). To bridge the gap between species, as between body plans, to him seemed to require a different type of mutation than those revealed by Morgan's fruit flies. This is the juncture at which it becomes clear that the scientific debate between Goldschmidt and Morgan was rooted in the different cultural and educational background of the two protagonists.

It is interesting to note that both geneticists, Goldschmidt and Morgan, started their careers in biology as comparative anatomists in the broad sense. Goldschmidt's affiliation with Carl Gegenbaur at the University of Heidelberg has been sketched above. As a graduate student, Morgan worked on the morphology of sea spiders under William K. Brooks (1848–1908) at Johns Hopkins University. After obtaining his PhD in 1890, Morgan was appointed as an associate professor at Bryn Mawr College, where he worked on the description of the anatomy of various marine invertebrates. The more he immersed himself in these studies, the less enchanted he became with what he perceived as wild evolutionary speculations put forward by other authors in the same field of research. In a paper he published in 1894 on the acorn worm _Balanoglossus_ , an organism that at the time was under discussion as being close to the ancestry of vertebrates, Morgan explained that he wanted to "avoid the introduction of extreme phylogenetic speculation and to stick to observed facts" (1894:74; see also Bowler, 1996:188). After joining the faculty at Columbia University in 1894, a stipend allowed Morgan to visit and work at the marine biological station in Naples, where he met Hans Driesch, who convinced Morgan of the virtues of an experimental approach to biology (Allen, 1974b:517). Driesch was at the time one of the leaders in experimental embryology, who early in his career had turned his back on phylogeny reconstruction, praising the virtues of experimentation, which yields neat, exact, and most importantly reproducible and consequently testable results—quite in contrast to comparative anatomy, where similarity often seemed to lie in the eye of the beholder. According to Driesch, comparative anatomists arrange animal forms in a series of putative ancestors and descendants, a mere "portrait gallery of ancestors" without any apparent underlying cause that could be critically tested through experimentation (Driesch, 1899:36; see also Nyhart, 2002:9). Morgan brought the same sober approach to genetics: a quest for experimentally secured, reproducible results, unadulterated by phylogenetic speculations (Harwood, 1993:102).

Morgan's approach to genetics was thoroughly atomistic and mechanistic. Genes were conceived of as material particles, arranged in a linear fashion on a chromosome. The chromosome was conceived of as a string of beads, with the beads being the genes. Chromosomes can break, lose parts, invert segments, and have parts cross over to other chromosomes. This might change the sequence in which the genes are arranged, but the genes were still beads aligned on a string. Through their breeding experiments, the Morgan school tried to identify which genes correlate with which characters of the fruit fly and to identify the location of those genes on the chromosome. In contrast to Morgan, Goldschmidt held a much more comprehensive view of nature in general, as also of chromosomes and of genes in particular. Given his German background and the time and cultural surroundings in which he grew up, it is hardly surprising that Goldschmidt endorsed a much more holistic, organicist conception of nature. Be they embryos, species, ecosystems, or higher taxonomic units, all were seen by many German scholars during the early decades of the twentieth century not as mere aggregates, as are beads on a string, but as tightly integrated, complex wholes. For Goldschmidt, the chromosome was not a linear aggregate of individual genes but instead a tightly integrated complex whole, composed of reciprocally interdependent parts. The inversion of a segment in a chromosome, or the crossing over of a segment from one chromosome to another, amounted in his eyes not just to a realignment and/or rearrangement of genes as beads on a string, but to a fundamental reorganization of that whole system—the complex and highly integrated machinery that a chromosome is as a whole. The chromosome as a whole was in his eyes more than the mere sum of the genes aligned along it (Harwood, 1993:252). Similarly, Goldschmidt was not satisfied with research that sought a mere correlation between genes and fruit fly characters. He wanted to ask bigger questions, even if these could not yet be tackled experimentally. He saw the necessity to understand how genes control the physiology of an organism, and most importantly how genes guide the development of an embryo.

In the tradition of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology at which he had been employed, Goldschmidt sought to use genetics as a means through which to unify biology—or at least the experimental branches of the biological sciences, which are genetics, physiology, and embryology (Harwood, 1993:44). He was not satisfied with mere "bean-bag" genetics (Mayr, 1982:67); he aspired to a physiological genetics, and even more importantly to a developmental genetics. These were complex questions that could not be answered by breeding experiments alone. They required much more far-reaching, if also more difficult, research. Indeed, given the instruments available at the time, and the then-current knowledge in physiology and molecular biology, Goldschmidt asked questions that were hardly answerable at the time except in a highly speculative way. This is why Morgan largely eschewed those issues. It is also the juncture at which Goldschmidt lost himself in speculation—which he had claimed Stresemann and Rensch to be guilty of with their theories on speciation.

To explain the origin of a new species, or of a new body plan, Goldschmidt invoked what he called systemic mutations. A systemic mutation is one that affects the whole system, i.e., the entire complex whole that is the chromosome as well as the organism within which a chromosome is active. The origin of a new discrete species, as also the origin of a new body plan, Goldschmidt defined as a process that transforms a stable, highly integrated system (or complex whole) into a different, yet again in itself stable and highly integrated system, where the system could be a species, or a body plan (Goldschmidt, 1940:250). Systemic mutations, as they might result from the restructuring of chromosomes through the loss, inversion, or crossing over of parts, would be the type of mutations explaining such systemic evolution: "The repatterning of the chromosome produces at once a new genetic system with all its consequences.... This 'at once' is an important point" (1940:245). The embryo he again conceived of as a developmental system; he argued that the origin of a new species, or of a new body plan, requires a considerable number of developmental processes to be changed so that a different organization would be brought about.

Goldschmidt drew heavily on the work of German paleontologists discussed in the previous chapter, such as Jaekel, Beurlen, and Schindewolf, who had in his view convincingly argued that higher-level, i.e., macroevolutionary, change is saltational and that evolution is orthogenetic, i.e., cyclical and goal directed. His systemic mutations, Goldschmidt claimed, would explain exactly this pattern of change, one documented by the fossil record according to the authorities he quoted. Systemic mutations that affected early stages of embryonic development would have exactly the effect that Jaekel, Beurlen, and Schindewolf had envisaged as well: they would set the embryo on a different developmental trajectory such that a new body plan would develop. In an early review paper, Goldschmidt (1924) had already sketched embryonic development in terms of a system of bifurcating developmental pathways, where systemic mutations would flip the switch from one side to the other of the bifurcations.

However, given that the embryo is a complex, highly integrated system, the reprogramming of early developmental stages through systemic mutations surely carried a high risk for a monstrous outcome that would in all likelihood result in the death of the organism at some later stage of development. What Goldschmidt needed was a theory of hopeful monsters, where the repatterning of embryonic development would result in the successful establishment of a major evolutionary lineage that is marked out by a new body plan. This is where Goldschmidt coupled the theory of orthogenesis with the concept of preadaptation. Orthogenesis would constrain systemic mutations in such a way that their effect would be preadaptive, allowing the embryo to survive: "If there are only a few avenues free for the action of mutational changes without knocking out of the order the whole properly balanced system of reactions, the probability is exceedingly high that repeated mutations will go in the same direction, will be orthogenetic." Goldschmidt went on to claim that paleontology offered "most beautiful examples" of orthogenetic evolutionary change, thus proving that orthogenesis is neither a consequence of Darwinian natural selection, nor the result of some mystical causes, but the necessary outcome of way genes interact during embryonic development (1933:544).

The hopeful monster, then, is one born from Goldschmidt's synthesis of comparative anatomy, embryology, paleontology (of the orthogenetic brand), and genetics (Goldschmidt, 1940:184). The hopeful monster emerges from a process where systemic mutations affecting early stages of embryonic development are constrained through orthogenetic evolution in such a way that the resulting monster is "preadapted to certain [new] modes of living" (1933:545). Any further questions? Not for Goldschmidt, the Herr Professor: "The facts and conclusions regarding the hopeful monster are so obvious that there is no need for a long discussion" (1940:392).

Hopeful Monsters Are Here to Stay

"Hopeful monsters are here to stay" was the title of a paper published in the journal _Theory in Biosciences_ in 2009 (Theiβen, 2009; see also Theiβen, 2006). This is not to say that modern evolutionary theory incorporates Goldschmidt's ideas lock, stock, and barrel. Goldschmidt thought systemic mutations to be preadaptive, due to the constraining nature of the orthogenetic evolutionary progress. The very concept of progressive evolution is in jeopardy in modern evolutionary theory: is a crab or a lobster more or less progressive than an eel or a salamander in their ascent along the ladder of life? Is a turtle with its shell and horny beak more or less progressive than a swiftly moving lizard whose jaws are furnished with daggerlike teeth? Progressionism in evolution is in trouble today, and so is orthogenesis, the theory that claims that major evolutionary lineages go through an evolutionary cycle that mirrors the life cycle of individual organisms. Modern philosophers of biology have developed arguments that are as sophisticated as they are complicated, on the basis of which a species, as well as a natural group of species of common ancestry, a so-called monophyletic taxon, can be considered to constitute an individual, i.e., to form a complex whole as some sort of superorganism. However, no modern evolutionary biologist would contend that such evolutionary lineages of monophyletic origin—such superorganisms—would undergo a cycle of vigorous youth, adulthood, senescence, and death as individual organisms do.

Even the concept of preadaptation has come under heavy fire for its teleological connotations, meaning that the concept of preadaptation implies some sort of goal directedness of evolutionary change, as Goldschmidt indeed believed to be the case. In order to avoid such untenable connotations, eminent Harvard evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould (1941–2002) and Yale paleobiologist Elisabeth Vrba (born 1942) replaced the concept of preadaptation with their own concept of exaptation (Gould and Vrba, 1982). Consider the evolution of feathers, and active flight, in birds. Feathers are highly complex structures, especially those in the wings of actively flying birds. It is inconceivable that such structures evolved in a single step, the consequence of some sort of preadaptive macromutation. Instead, feathers evolved through a series of intermediate steps, as is today particularly well demonstrated by the feathered dinosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous of Liaoning province in China, some 130 million years old. It is from such crude structures as are observed in the theropod dinosaur _Sinosauropteryx_ , for example, that feathers are thought to have evolved (Chen, Dong, and Zhen, 1998; Currie and Chen, 2001). It is tempting to say that these fossil integumentary filaments were preadaptations—that feathers evolved for flight. But that would mean that starting out from such simple integumentary structures as seen in _Sinosauropteryx_ , a series of transformational steps would have taken place with the goal to bring forth feathers of the kind that are required for active flight. There is, however, no evolutionary mechanism known that would impose such goal directedness on any such process of transformation. Rudimentary feathers must first have evolved in response to other adaptational pressures, most likely body insulation against heat loss in an endothermic organism, perhaps also with a display function in social behavior. Only later, at an advanced stage of their transformation, would feathers have been co-opted for flight. In retrospect, and avoiding any connotation of goal directedness, Gould and Vrba proposed to talk of early stages of feather evolution not as being preadapted for flight but instead as being an exaptation for flight. This renders ancestral feathers an adaptation for body insulation, which was later in descendants co-opted for flight.

I hope to have made it clear that much of the theoretical background on which Goldschmidt based his concept of hopeful monsters is no longer accepted by modern evolutionary biology: evolutionary progress, orthogenesis, and to some degree the concept of preadaptation are all out the window. Yet there awakened in the 1980s a renewed interest in Goldschmidt's theorizing, driven initially by Gould, who rejected the neo-Darwinian doctrine that—in his own words—"macroevolution (major structural transition) is nothing more than microevolution (flies in bottles) extended" (Gould, 1977a:22). Gould's provocative essay, "The Return of Hopeful Monsters" (1977a), sought to revitalize the basic ideas about macroevolution proposed by Goldschmidt, the "Jewish refugee from Hitler's decimation of German science" (1977a:22). Gould's interest in Goldschmidt was spurred by his dissatisfaction with the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory. The received wisdom was that all major evolutionary transitions can ultimately be reduced to microevolutionary processes playing out at the level of interbreeding populations. The major focus of evolutionary research consequently was on population genetics and the mechanisms of speciation, i.e., the origin of new species from local populations or subspecies. Given the importance of genetic isolation for local populations to be able to evolve into a new species, geographic as well as ecological, behavioral, physiological, and anatomical aspects of speciation were intensively studied as well, especially with respect to their role in establishing genetic barriers. What Gould found most prominently missing in the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory was an incorporation of developmental, i.e., embryological, investigations of major structural transitions—precisely the issue Goldschmidt had placed center stage in the second part of his classic 1940 book. Indeed, Gould pushed for a reprint of Goldschmidt's _The Material Basis of Evolution_ , which appeared in 1982 through Yale University Press. Gould contributed a foreword to this edition in which he stated, "Goldschmidt's vision was sound—and it supplied (or resupplied) an essential ingredient that strict Darwinism had expunged from evolutionary theory: the idea that evolution works through a hierarchy of distinct levels with important independent properties" (Gould in Goldschmidt, 1982:xl).

Population genetics is one level—but not the only level—at which evolution plays out. The 1980s-era revival of interest in Goldschmidt's macroevolutionary theories was motivated by several factors, at the core of which was the concept of a hierarchical structure of life. The gene became recognized as a dynamic complex whole that forms part of the genome, a dynamic complex whole of a higher order, i.e., of greater inclusiveness, than the gene. From there on come the cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism—each complex wholes encased one within the other in an order of ascending, more inclusive hierarchical levels. When Gould speaks of "independent properties," he means emergent properties that characterize each level of this organismic hierarchy. This means, as it did for Goldschmidt, that the complex whole at any level of the organismic hierarchy is more than the mere sum of its parts, with properties of its own that are not simply the aggregate properties of its parts.

Gould published a masterpiece titled _Ontogeny and Phylogeny_ (1977b) through Harvard University Press that not only presented a superb historical sketch related to that topic but also, perhaps even more importantly, charted a new direction in which to investigate how embryonic development relates to major structural changes in anatomy. It emphasized the role of genetic control over developmental processes and the importance of changing the relative speed of development in organs or organ systems, as is evident in major evolutionary transitions—issues no doubt close to Goldschmidt's heart. The issue of how studies of embryonic development, at both the genetic and morphological level, can be brought to bear on an understanding of major evolutionary transformations of anatomical structures evolved into a highly innovative branch of research called evolutionary developmental biology. This type of interest and research experienced an initial flourishing during the 1980s, with many books following Gould's pioneering classic. Coupled with these developments was an intensified interest in the molecular basis of homeotic mutations, as when a leg instead of an antenna grows out of a fruit fly's head. A homeotic mutation was defined as a "mutation that causes one structure to develop in a place where another structure would normally develop" (Dietrich, 2003:71). Indeed, Goldschmidt had himself studied homeotic mutations in fruit flies such as the _podoptera_ and _tetraltera_ mutants (Dietrich, 2000). In _podoptera_ , legs develop in the place of wings, whereas in _tetraltera_ , halteres develop in the place of wings (halteres are "small wing-like appendages that are located on the third thoracic segments of _Drosophila_ and act as balancing organs") (Dietrich, 2003:71).

Besides the burgeoning field of evo-devo and the related molecular research into homeotic mutations, Gould exploited other aspects of comparative embryology and anatomy in support of saltational evolutionary changes, as are implied by Goldschmidt's concept of hopeful monsters. What Gould used in this context in his seminal 1977 monograph were examples that leave no logical space to invoke one of those famous Darwinian intermediates that would link an ancestral with a descendant condition of form yet that remained prominently missing in the fossil record. One such example had at the time just been popularized by comparative and functional anatomist Thomas H. Frazzetta (1934–2015) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in his book on _Complex Adaptations in Evolving Populations_ (1975:147–150). Frazzetta had already commented on the strange booid snakes broadly related to boas and pythons in an earlier article titled "From Hopeful Monsters to Bolyerine Snakes" (1970). Bolyerine snakes comprise four species in three genera. Two of these species—one of which is now believed to be extinct—are from Round Island just north of Mauritius, and the other two species are from Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, respectively.

Representing "the most often cited vertebrate examples of Goldschmidt's (1940) concept of the evolutionary 'hopeful monster,'" these snakes show a feature that is unique among tetrapods, which is a bipartition of the upper jaw, or maxillary bone (Cundall and Irish, 1989:570). In the Round Island boa, this bipartition of the maxillary resulted in complex, correlated changes in the way the upper jaw has to be suspended from the braincase. The functional significance of such a bipartition of the maxillary bone seems to be related to "selection pressures arising from limited prey diversity," requiring these snakes to feed on prey that is difficult to handle, such as scincoid lizards with a smooth yet hard and slippery skin (Cundall and Irish, 1989:569). From a developmental and evolutionary perspective, it is nevertheless clear that the maxillary bone can be a single undivided element, or it can be split into two halves. No third intermediate seems to be possible. In Gould's words: "How can a jawbone be half broken?" (1977a:28). But then, how did the maxillary bone get subdivided in a single evolutionary step in these boylerine snakes? The answer lies in embryonic development. The snakes in question are so rare that embryos have never become available for investigation. But it turns out that in closely related species, the maxillary bone ossifies from two ossification centers, an anterior and a posterior one. An ossification center is simply a spot where calcification of bone is initiated and from which the formation of bone spreads through a membrane (as in the dermis layer of the skin, as is the case for the maxillary bone) or through degenerating cartilage (as in the endoskeleton). Whereas in related boas and pythons the ossifications that spread from two separate ossification centers eventually fuse to form a single unified maxillary bone, such fusion apparently never happens in the Round Island boa as a result of a simple truncation of development. A simple change of the relative timing of developmental events, in this case a termination of development before the fusion of an anterior and posterior ossification, results in a major structural change: a bipartite upper jaw (Irish and Alberch, 1989).

Goldschmidt's hopeful monsters cut much deeper than that, however. They go to the very heart of how to understand, indeed to think about, evolutionary change and innovation, with the jaws of vertebrates again providing a recently much discussed paradigmatic example (another is the turtle shell, which will be discussed in detail in the next chapter). Consider Darwin's twin mechanisms of evolution: variation and natural selection. Evolutionary success relative to natural selection is measured through relative reproductive success: as it generates more offspring, the better-adapted organism passes on its genes more frequently than the less well-adapted organism. Evolutionary success is thus cashed out at the adult, sexually mature stage. Variation, in turn, always affects only structures already in existence. Variation and natural selection can never create something entirely new or entirely different—something that has no counterpart in the ancestral condition of form. Variation and natural selection can only affect, and transform, something that is already in existence in the ancestor. The descendant may differ from the ancestor in its anatomy, but the difference can only be one of some greater or lesser transformation of a part (organ) that was present in its primitive form in the ancestor as well—the same but different. These parts we have earlier identified as homologues: an organ or organ system that is present in the ancestor is also present in the descendant, although it may have been transformed through descent with modification, the latter driven by variation and natural selection as explained by Darwin. As Darwin's friend and bulldog, Thomas H. Huxley (1825–1895), said in his famous Croonian lecture on the vertebrate skull, delivered to the Royal Society of London on June 17, 1858, "That there is nothing really aberrant in nature; that the most widely different organisms are connected by a hidden bond; that an apparently new and isolated structure will prove, when its characters are thoroughly sifted, to be only a modification of something which existed before" (1858:382).

There is thus never anything genuinely new in nature; everything we see is but a modification or transformation of something that already existed before. This Darwinian conception of evolutionary change can be called the transformationist paradigm, and it is this paradigm that calls for a continuous series of intermediates between two conditions of form—a requirement poorly fulfilled by the fossil record. Make no mistake; there are in the fossil record beautiful transitional lineages documented both for invertebrates and vertebrates. Among the latter, the synapsid (mammal-like reptile) to mammal transition, or the theropod dinosaur to bird transition most prominently come to mind. Still, the question may be asked whether the transformationist paradigm is indeed sufficient to explain the evolution of a tree of life that encompasses everything from the amoeba to humans.

Since Huxley's lecture was about the vertebrate skull, we might as well ask, what about the jaws? What was that ancestral structure that transformed to become the jaws of the so-called jawed vertebrates, the gnathostomes? As already mentioned, the earliest and most primitive fishes had no jaws. Many of these jawless agnathans ( _Agnatha_ ) were bottom-dwelling filter feeders, whose modern descendants are the lampreys and the hagfish. The presence of jaws thus marks out the jawed vertebrates as a natural, i.e., monophyletic, group, the gnathostomes ( _Gnathostomata_ ). But whereas the agnathans had no jaws, they had gill arches supporting the gills. The gills in turn develop along gill slits that perforate the wall of the esophagus. Gills serve the function of oxygen exchange—breathing—but as the water passed across the gill filaments, the gills would also filter planktonic food particles that in these extinct agnathans would be retained in the esophagus and passed through the intestinal tract. A celebrated theory on the origin of the vertebrate jaws goes back to Carl Bogislaus Reichert (1811–1883), who in 1837 suggested that the upper and lower jaw of the jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) correspond to the upper and lower halves of the first gill arch (called the first visceral arch by Reichert) of agnathans. Seen from a transformationist perspective, this would have to mean that the already present first gill arch of ancestral agnathans transformed to become the jaws of the descendants, the gnathostomes, while the second gill arch (called the second visceral arch by Reichert) transformed to provide support elements for the suspension of the jaws from the braincase. This is how something like a shark would have evolved from something like an extinct (Paleozoic) agnathan. There is only one problem with this account of Reichert's theory: Reichert did not reach his conclusions by comparing fossil or living agnathans with fossil or modern gnathostomes. Instead, he reached his conclusions based on comparative developmental (embryological) investigation of a series of gnathostomes, in particular toad, chicken, sheep, and pig embryos. The gill arch skeleton in both the living hagfish and lampreys is highly specialized, forming a basketlike structure that is hardly directly comparable to the jaws and gill arch skeleton in something like a shark, i.e., a primitive gnathostome. But the gill arch skeleton in fossil agnathans was specialized in its own ways too. There are no simple, unspecialized structures in adult ancestors from which, through stepwise transformation, the upper and lower jaws of a shark could be derived. Every organism, whether extinct or extant, has to be adapted in some way to the special circumstances of its environment. Eminent German comparative anatomist Dietrich Starck (1908–2001) from the University of Frankfurt am Main, who spent a lifetime researching problems concerning the vertebrate head and skull, summed up his frustration as follows: there is no species known, fossil or living, in which the first two gill arches appear in a simple, unspecialized form from which the upper and lower jaws of gnathostomes and their support structures could easily be derived; convincing intermediate conditions of form that would document the evolution of jaws have likewise not been identified in either fossil or extant vertebrates (Starck, 1979:152ff.).

The problem of the transformationist paradigm results—to use the terminology of Adolf Remane—from the nonexistence of a zero-value ancestor, one that would show no special adaptations of any kind to any particular environment, and for this reason would not have been viable ( _Nullwertahne_ ) (Remane, 1948). To derive a transformed, newly adapted structure from an ancestral one requires the ancestral structure to be primitive, or generalized, in all aspects relative to the derived structure. Such a totally generalized ancestral structure would, however, not be adapted to any specific mode of life. But every living organism must somehow be adapted to some sort of mode of life. This renders such a generalized, zero-value ancestor that is not adapted to any specific mode of life a biological impossibility. Conversely, if an ancestral form must to some degree be specialized, or adapted, to pursue a certain mode of life, then it must in some way get rid of its specializations, i.e., adaptations, before it can serve as the starting point for a transformation that takes it in a different direction, i.e., toward a different specialization and adaptation to be realized in the descendant form. However, such a roundabout way of evolutionary transformation does not need to happen if evolutionary transformation starts from early embryonic stages, which have not yet reached a notable degree of specialization.

In recent research, Shigeru Kuratani and his collaborators at the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan used sophisticated molecular techniques in an attempt to shed new light on the origin of vertebrate jaws. The starting point for these studies was the insight that "the fossil record has not revealed any ancestral animals with an undifferentiated series of gill arches in their pharynx," i.e., the fossil record has not yielded a zero-value ancestral condition of the gill arch skeleton. Consequently, "an ancestral animal with simple gill arches... is purely hypothetical" (Kuratani, 2004:336; see also Janvier, 1996). The studies conducted at the RIKEN Center targeted the cell populations that in the embryo would give rise to what the authors called an oral apparatus, of which the upper and lower jaws of gnathostomes are parts. During very early stages of development, the head region in a lamprey and a gnathostome show a similar regional patterning at the cellular level, conditioned by shared genes, an indication of homology of these discrete cell populations and hence of a common ancestry of vertebrates. However, the same cell population that in gnathostomes gives rise to the upper and lower jaws in the lamprey ammocete (larva) forms mucocartilaginous structures in the lower lip and in the velum, the latter a functional part of the complex filter-feeding apparatus that characterizes the ammocete (Kuratani, 2005; Kuratani et al., 2012). During their very early development, the lamprey and gnathostomes thus share a closely similar condition of form. During later stages of development, however, the lamprey and gnathostomes deviate from one another as the cell populations contributing to the oral apparatus follow radically different developmental pathways: the cell population that gives rise to the jaws of gnathostomes gives rise to structures in the lower lip and velum in the ammocete instead. This is exactly the classical pattern of development that embryologist Baer had already identified in his immortal monograph of 1828. What this says, however, is not that an ancestral structure, adapted to a certain mode of life and tested by natural selection in terms of the relative reproductive success of the carrier of that structure, is being transformed into a descendant, differently adapted structure—from gill arch to jaw, for example. Instead, what this says is that, starting from an early developmental stage, an only rudimentarily differentiated precursor of some ancestral structure—such as a topologically circumscribed population of cells—can, as a consequence of changes (mutations) in the cascade of regulatory genes, be reprogrammed so as to continue differentiation along a different developmental trajectory in the descendant, with the consequence that a true evolutionary novelty arises.

Technically speaking, an evolutionary novelty was defined in those recent studies on the evolution of vertebrate jaws as "a new structure that arises by overriding ancestral developmental constraints, so that morphological homology is lost between the novel and ancestral structures" (Kuratani, 2004:339, following Wagner and Müller, 2002). That may sound difficult, but it is not. Take an ancestral cell population in the lamprey's head, destined to develop to form structures in the lower lip and velum in the larval oral apparatus. Such destiny of those cells is written into the lamprey's genome; in other words, genetic instructions guide and constrain these cells to form structures in the lower lip and velum of the ammocete. Now let evolutionary transformation override this ancestral developmental program and reprogram that same cell population in the descendant to develop into the upper and lower jaws of gnathostomes. The jaws then represent an evolutionary novelty. It makes little sense to say that structures in the lower lip and velum of the lamprey ammocete are equivalent, i.e., homologous, to the upper and lower jaws of gnathostomes. It makes more sense to leave such tenuous homology assessments aside and to say that gnathostome jaws represent an evolutionary novelty that evolved through the reprogramming of an ancestral cell population so as to develop (differentiate) along a novel developmental pathway (see Havstad, Assis, and Rieppel, 2015, for more discussion).

To understand structural transformation from such a perspective, i.e., a reprogramming of developmental pathways in a way that creates evolutionary novelties, might be called an emergentist paradigm, one that contrasts with the transformationist paradigm sketched above. The transformationist approach seeks to explain morphological evolution as a stepwise transformation of some fully differentiated (adult) ancestral structure into a fully differentiated (adult) descendant condition of form through variation and natural selection. This is how ancestors and descendants get strung together through a series of intermediates. The emergentist approach seeks to explain the emergence of evolutionary novelties through the reprogramming of the development of an ancestral embryonic rudiment in the descendant lineage. Intermediate conditions of form at the adult, i.e., reproductive, stage are not to be expected on the basis of the emergentist paradigm. Ancestor and descendant may remain separated by a morphologic gap. This is the core idea of Goldschmidt's concept of hopeful monsters, and one that would entail saltational evolutionary change.

What is left in modern molecular evolutionary developmental studies of Goldschmidt's core idea of a hopeful monster? The best current answer, I think, comes from Günter Wagner (born 1954) from Yale University, who in 2014 published a book about _Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation_. Wagner is almost uniquely positioned to answer that question. He is as much at home in mathematical modeling of natural selection as he is in studies on the genetic, or more broadly molecular, mechanisms that guide and constrain embryonic development. Given such an unusually broad perspective, Wagner again confirms that major evolutionary innovations are not the result of variation and natural selection that play out at the population and species levels. Of course, evolution does occur at the population and species levels as a consequence of variation and natural selection, but Wagner calls this level of evolution adaptive. The Darwinian twin mechanisms of evolution promote the adaption of species, and their populations, to their specific conditions of life—to their local environment. To understand major evolutionary innovations, those that bring about novel body plans, one must, according to Wagner, turn to embryonic development and the genetic molecular mechanisms that underlie it. New body plans originate through the evolution of new gene regulatory networks that bring about, and maintain through successive generations, evolutionary innovations. One of the most striking evolutionary innovations, also chosen by Wagner to bring his point across, is the turtle shell.

In the next chapter I will recount how the protracted debate about the evolution of the turtle shell continuously shifted back and forth between the transformationist and the emergentist paradigms. In sketching the history of the alternative theories invoked to explain the evolution of the turtle shell, it is important to understand that this (still ongoing) debate is not just fueled by whatever observations have been made or are being made by the use of ever more sophisticated techniques. The debate is also, and just as much, fueled by the way the observer looks at nature in search for evidence bearing on the problem of the origin of the turtle shell—whether from a transformationist or an emergentist perspective. As embryologist Baer put it, research is an interplay between observation and critical reflection. Research is concept driven to start with. The results of research in turn enrich the concepts that triggered it in the first place—a point again forcefully made by Günter Wagner. Some researchers think evolutionary transformations are best studied by the comparison of adult organisms represented as fossils at successive time intervals in the fossil record. The conceptual justification for that approach is the claim that fossils are the only direct evidence we have of evolutionary transformation. The result will be to bring a transformationist perspective to the study of fossils. Other researchers think that evolutionary transformations are best studied by the comparison of embryonic development and its underlying genetic causes. The conceptual justification for that approach is the claim that what is inherited from parents and ancestors are not adult traits but rather developmental programs that regulate the development of adult traits. The result will be to bring an emergentist perspective to the study of evolutionary developmental biology.

Prizewinning Research on the Turtle Shell

BORN IN NEW YORK CITY, HERBERT RUCKES (1895–1965) PURSUED A double-tracked research program is his capacity as professor at the Grove City College in New York and research associate at the AMNH. The bulk of his publications turns on insect systematics, but his early work on the turtle skeleton won him the A. Cressy Morrison Prize of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1928 (Anonymous, 1966). It was in the _Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences_ that Ruckes published his startling observations concerning a highly puzzling feature of the turtle body plan. Reach backward with your right arm across your left shoulder, while rolling the latter up and down. This will allow you to feel your shoulder blade moving. As you inspire air into your lungs, you will feel your chest expand; it contracts again as you exhale. These breathing movements are supported by muscles associated with the rib cage and assisted by the diaphragm. The ribs that form the rib cage articulate on the backbone, the vertebral column. From there, they curve around the body to meet the sternum in a cartilaginous connection. This means, however, that as you feel your shoulder blade moving up and down, it must be located superficially, i.e., outside the rib cage. Indeed, the shoulder blade, also known as scapula, is located outside the rib cage in all tetrapods: in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals—but not turtles. They are the single exception in which the scapula is located inside the rib cage. How could that relocation of the scapula evolve? As with the bipartite upper jawbone in bolyerine snakes discussed in the previous chapter, there seem to be no intermediate conditions of form possible. The maxillary bone is either a single element, as in all (other) tetrapods, or bipartite, as in bolyerine snakes; the scapula lies either outside the rib cage, as in all (other) tetrapods, or inside the rib cage as in turtles. There seems to be no third alternative available. Could the turtle shell, the structure of which is responsible for the location of the scapula inside the rib cage, be a case of saltational macroevolution, having brought forth a hopeful monster in the distant geologic past?

As is customary in science, Ruckes noted in his classic paper of 1929 that he was by no means the first to tackle this difficult problem. He duly cited, among others to be introduced later, the honorable D. M. S. Watson from the University College London, who in his 1914 paper on the putative turtle ancestor _Eunotosaurus_ from the Permian of the Karoo of South Africa had claimed—in the tradition of the transformationist paradigm—that during the transition to turtles, the shoulder girdle had migrated backward along the vertebral column, thus dislocating the scapula to a posterior position inside the rib cage. However, "I believe this interpretation is wholly incorrect and that the girdles do not migrate at all," was Ruckes's objection (1929:85). Instead, seeking a solution to this riddle in the study of the embryonic development of modern turtles, he discovered developmental changes that affect the relative rate of growth and differentiation of various organ systems in a way that results in a topological relocation not only of the ribs relative to the scapula but also affecting other parts of the turtle body plan. Needless to say, Ruckes's pioneering investigations were the foundation on which present-day developmental studies that use ever more sophisticated techniques have been built (Burke, 2015:83).

To understand those studies, and hence to get a grip on the intricacies of the evolution of the turtle body plan, it is first necessary to understand the nature of the turtle shell, which is a complex structure indeed. The fact that the scapula comes to lie inside the rib cage in turtles is intimately connected with the development and evolution of the carapace. What is the anatomy of the turtle shell? To fully understand its complexity from an evolutionary perspective, it will be necessary to return to the endoskeleton versus exoskeleton distinction introduced earlier. The fully developed turtle shell comprises two principal components. The armor that covers the back, the dorsal side of the trunk, is called the carapace. The armor that covers the belly, the ventral side of the trunk, is called the plastron. Carapace and plastron are linked on either side of the body by a bony bridge. It is from in front and behind of that bony bridge that the fore- and hind limbs project out from the shell. The gait of turtles looks so clumsy as they move across land because this lateral bony bridge restricts the range of movement of the humerus (upper arm) and femur (upper leg) (Walker, 1979). All reptiles have a keratinized epidermis, which renders the outer layer of the skin an efficient barrier to evaporative water loss. The bony carapace, as well as the bony plastron (and of course the bones in the lateral bridge as well), are consequently covered by keratinized scutes. Confusion often arises from the fact that the sutures between these horny scutes do not also match the sutures formed by the underlying bony elements that compose the carapace and plastron. As one inspects the carapace of a skeletonized turtle, it is thus important to accurately distinguish the interdigitating sutures between the bony plates that together compose the carapace and the grooves that are marked out on the surface of those bony plates, which indicate the contours of the overlying keratinized scutes now removed. The story of the relative position of the scapula and the ribs, and indeed the intricacies that relate to the development and evolution of the turtle body plan, relate to the carapace more than to the plastron.

The plastron protects a swimming turtle from predators attacking from below. It is composed of a series of bony plates, all but one of which come in pairs. At the anterior end of the plastron, the paired epiplastra embrace the anterior tip of the unpaired entoplastron. These three anterior elements in the plastron are believed to derive from ancestral elements in the shoulder girdle. The primitive tetrapod shoulder girdle comprises exoskeletal (dermal) and endoskeletal (chondral) elements. The dermal elements are the ventral clavicle and the dorsal cleithrum. The clavicles of the left and right pectoral girdle are connected with one another through the interclavicle. The chondral elements, lying deep to the dermal ones, are the ventral coracoid and the dorsal scapula. It is believed that in the turtle plastron, the epiplastra represent the clavicles and the entoplastron represents the interclavicle. Behind those three anterior elements there follow a series of paired bony plates, which, proceeding from front to back, are called the hyoplastron, mesoplastron, hypoplastron, and xiphiplastron. Of these, the mesoplastron can either be missing, or one or two pairs of mesoplastra may be present. Other variations may exist as well. Although it is believed that the epi- and entoplastron represent elements of the ancestral pectoral girdle, the remainder of the plastron is generally derived from gastral ribs (Zangerl, 1969). The latter have nothing to do with the true ribs that grow from and articulate with the axial skeleton (vertebral column). The gastral ribs are not preformed in cartilage, as are the true ribs, but are of dermal origin. They are barshaped elements of variable composition that ossify in the deep dermis layer of the skin, forming a gastral basket in the ventral body wall. The bony elements in the lateral bridge are likewise simple dermal ossifications that form directly in the deep layer of the skin (dermis) without being preformed in cartilage.

The anatomy of the carapace is, by comparison, much more complicated, creating headaches and seemingly endless debate among comparative anatomists, developmental biologists, and paleontologists. It too is composed of a series of bony plates, some of which have a complex origin, as will be discussed below. But let us sort out the geometry of the carapace first before talking about its embryonic development. The anteriormost element in the carapace is the broad nuchal pate, characterized by an anterior embayment. It shields the posterior part of the neck of turtles, hence its name. It is the first element to ossify in the embryonic turtle carapace, and it does so, oddly enough, in two distinct phases of ossification, without having been preformed in cartilage (Gilbert et al., 2007). Behind the nuchal plate follows a series of eight oblong rectangular elements running down the midline of the carapace. These are called the neural plates because they are underlain by the neural arches of the trunk vertebrae. A reptile—indeed a tetrapod—vertebra generally comprises two parts, the vertebral body, or centrum, and the neural arch that sits on top of the centrum, with the two often fused in the adult stage. The vertebral centrum underlies the spinal cord, the latter being accommodated in a furrow that is hollowed out on the upper surface of the centrum. The neural arch roofs over the spinal cord; it forms two pedicels that on either side of the spinal cord reach down to come to rest on the surface of the centrum, to the left and the right of the furrow containing the spinal cord. That way, the spinal cord is safely encased in a bony tube formed jointly by the centrum and the neural arch of successive vertebrae. Dorsally, the neural arch expands into a neural spine, to which attach muscles that help bend the vertebral column. If you run your finger down the midline of your back, you will feel a series of bumps, each representing the tip of the neural spines of the trunk vertebrae. In the trunk region of turtles, the neural spine of each dorsal vertebra remains very low and appears to be capped by the neural plate of the carapace. At the back end on the midline of the carapace sits the pygal plate, which covers the pelvic region and the base of the tail.

On either side of the neural plates, and alternating with them, expand the costal plates. They form the major part of the carapace, shielding the dorsal aspect of a turtle's trunk. The name of the costal plates derives from the fact that they are intimately related to the ribs of the trunk region, i.e., the dorsal ribs. Given that what was said above, this leaves only the periphery of the carapace to be dealt with. That is composed of a series of so-called marginal plates, aligned alongside the costal plates. Many fossil turtles, but also some living turtles—the snapping turtle and the soft-shelled turtles are good examples—are unable to hide their head and neck under the carapace. Those that can do so developed specialized articulations between some of the neck vertebrae, and they come in two kinds. The side-necked or pleurodire turtles simply bend the head and neck sideways to hide them under the nuchal and adjacent marginal plates. The hidden-necked or cryptodire turtles, in contrast, are able to pull the head back under the nuchal plate by folding the neck, and with it the series of cervical vertebrae, into a complicated, vertically positioned S-shaped curve. Those turtles, both living and fossil, which cannot bring head and neck under the carapace can be assigned to the pleurodire or cryptodire lineage on the basis of fundamental differences that characterize the jaw adductor muscle system and correlated skull features in those two lineages of turtle evolution. Such classification of turtles leaves only a handful of early fossil turtles from the Triassic to be classified outside the pleurodire–cryptodire dichotomy (Gaffney, 1975b; but see Joyce, 2007, for a dissenting view).

To understand why the carapace is such a headache-inducing structure, it is further necessary to understand the ubiquitous potential for the dermis layer of the vertebrate skin to form bone. Some of the earliest vertebrates, Silurian and Devonian jawless fishes (agnathans), some 400 million years old, were encased in a heavy dermal bony armor. However, a trout or a salmon are also entirely covered by bony scales. Much thinner and of a simpler structure than those of their ancestors, these delicate and translucent scales of trout and salmon are nonetheless genuine dermal ossifications, i.e., bony plates that ossify in the deep (dermis) layer of the skin without having first been preformed in cartilage. Such dermal ossifications also occur in tetrapods—just think of the armadillo—yet here they are no longer called scales but osteoderms instead, from _osteo_ , "bone," and _derm_ , which signifies their formation in the dermis, the deep layer of the skin. The cyamodontoid placodonts already touched on come to mind again, with a carapace entirely composed of osteoderms. Many other reptile lineages, most notably crocodiles, sport osteoderms as well. In one of the earliest known turtles, _Proganochelys_ from the Late Triassic of Germany, osteoderms formed in the skin covering the limbs, neck, and tail. How about the carapace? Did it evolve from an osteoderm cover shielding the back of the turtle ancestor? This is exactly were the controversy begins—or rather, where it began more than 200 years ago.

Before delving into that history and debate, let us add just one more layer of complexity to do justice to the intriguing structure of the turtle carapace, and return to the distinction of the exoskeleton from the endoskeleton, previously introduced in the discussion of the reptile skull and its significance for reptile classification. The heavy dermal armor covering the jawless fishes from eons past, the scales of the salmon and the trout, and the osteoderms of crocodiles and armadillos are all exoskeletal in nature: they ossify directly in the dermis layer of the skin, with no cartilaginous precursors. In contrast, the elements of the endoskeleton—the vertebrae, the ribs, and the limb bones—are first preformed in cartilage that may, during later development, be replaced either partially or wholly by bone in a process called ossification. But the distinction of exo- versus endoskeleton cuts much deeper. Teeth are exoskeletal in nature, with a crown composed of tissues that are different from bone. The bulk of the tooth crown is composed of dentin that encloses the pulp cavity. The microscopic structure of dentin is different from that of bone and also from that of enamel. Superficially, the dentin is covered by a hypermineralized and hence shiny layer of enamel. In mammals, cementum forms the root of the tooth, with the latter anchored in an alveolus located on a bony tooth-bearing element such as the dentary of the lower jaw. Although things are a bit more complicated in the world out there, it suffices for the present purpose to say that bone, dentin, and enamel are the three fundamental tissues that together make up the primitive exoskeleton. The heavy dermal armor that covered the body of many Paleozoic jawless fishes (agnathans), for example, is three layered, comprising a basal, inner layer of bone, an intermediate layer of dentin, and a superficial layer of enamel. The same three-layered structure is characteristic of the heavy body scales of Paleozoic and early Mesozoic ancestors of today's salmon and trout. What renders the scales of salmon and trout so thin and translucent is simply the evolutionary loss of the enamel and dentin layers, and the thinning of the bony layer. However, bringing dentin and enamel into play in the discussion of the exoskeleton introduces some important implications.

To recapitulate, the vertebrate skin is built up from the superficial (ectodermal) epidermis and the deeper (mesodermal) dermis. Dermal bone forms in the dermis—no problem there. But enamel is formed by cells (ameloblasts) that derive from the innermost layer of cells of the epidermis. Dentin, however, is formed by cells (odontoblasts) that derive from a distinct part of the embryonic central nervous system, the neural crest. Those neural crest cells destined to become odontoblasts migrate through the embryonic body to assemble just below boundary membrane that separates the epidermis from the dermis. Once arrived, they transform to become odontoblasts that start to produce a precursor substance of dentin; the latter in turn triggers the transformation of the innermost epidermis cells into ameloblasts producing enamel. Thus, the development of an armor plate in Paleozoic agnathans, or of a three-layered scale in a distant salmon ancestor, is necessarily tied to the boundary membrane between epidermis (ectoderm) and dermis (mesoderm), as they are composed of layers of bone, dentin, and enamel. This is because it is on either side of this boundary membrane that the enamel- and dentin-producing cells are aligned. In more general terms, then, the evolutionary origin of the vertebrate exoskeleton was primitively tied to the ectoderm–mesoderm interface—to the boundary membrane between epidermis and dermis in the skin. Such, of course, is not the case for the endoskeleton. Considered from that perspective, the exoskeleton and endoskeleton in vertebrates constitute two fundamentally different, indeed independent, evolutionary systems. The distinction of exoskeleton versus endoskeleton is one drawn from an evolutionary perspective, with important consequences to be discussed below. Developmental biologists who focus on the molecular aspects of bone formation, rather than on the evolutionary origin of bony structures, often do not endorse the endo-versus exoskeleton distinction because it falls outside the conceptual space of their research. They are happy to just talk about chondral bone, which is the bone replacing cartilage during ossification, and dermal (or membrane) bone, which is bone formed in the dermis layer of the skin (see, e.g., Burke, 2015).

In earlier research on the evolutionary origin of hard tissues such as cartilage, bone, dentin, and enamel, it was thought that the endoskeleton was the first to evolve in the history of vertebrates, whereas the exoskeleton had a later evolutionary origin. That would render the endoskeleton an evolutionarily more primitive structure than the exoskeleton. However, extensive comparative analysis throughout vertebrates, but especially in the skull of bony fishes (osteichthyans), has indicated that the exo- and endoskeleton evolved as separate systems throughout vertebrate history, never getting mixed up or intermingled (Patterson, 1977). It is the turtle shell that, once again, seems to provide the only vexing exception—or does it? The problem is that as one turns the carapace of a skeletonized turtle upside down to look at its inside, it becomes clear that the costal plates are intimately connected with the ribs of the trunk; indeed, they seem to incorporate them. The same is true for the neural spines of the trunk (dorsal) vertebrae and the neural plates of the carapace, although this is less easily appreciated without cutting through the bony structures.

The Turtle Carapace Takes Shape

The first treatise on the anatomy of turtles appeared in the year 1687, authored by Giovanni Caldesi, physician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Adler, 2007:139). However, the debate over the nature of that most conspicuous structure on which Linnaeus, in the first edition of his _Systema Naturae_ of 1735, based his diagnosis of turtles, the _testa munitum_ —the protective shell—started with the doyen of comparative vertebrate osteology, the celebrated Georges Cuvier from the Paris National Natural History Museum. He was among the first to take a stab at an interpretation of the turtle carapace. His treatise on the animal kingdom, _Le Règne Animal Distribué d'Après son Organisation_ , was designed not only to serve as a natural history of animal diversity but also to provide a foundation for comparative anatomy in general. In the second volume, published in Paris in 1817, he defined the turtles as reptiles with a heart that has two auricles, and whose body, supported by four legs, is completely enclosed by two plates, or shields, formed by the ribs and the breastbone (sternum), respectively (Cuvier, 1817:5, 6ff.). Further into the text, he elaborated on the carapace, noting that it is formed by the trunk (dorsal) ribs, eight in number on either side, that are broadened and hence meet each other along their length in interdigitating sutures. He recognized the participation of the neural arches of the trunk vertebrae in the carapace, as he thought that they form the neural plates that mediate between the costal plates of either side. The marginal plates of the carapace, as well as the plates in the lateral bridge, Cuvier somewhat vaguely referred to as being formed by that part of the ribs, which in other tetrapods would attach to the sternum. The plastron, correspondingly, he considered to correspond to the sternum of other tetrapods. In Cuvier's time, the distinction of exoskeleton and endoskeleton was not yet consistently drawn, but taking our present-day discussion presented above into his account, Cuvier's interpretation renders the turtle shell an entirely endoskeletal formation because the vertebral neural arches, the ribs, and the sternum are all preformed in cartilage in the embryo. The endoskeletal carapace and plastron were, in Cuvier's assessment, covered by skin, the latter producing the keratinized scutes that superficially cover the carapace and plastron. Today we know that the keratinized scutes derive from the epidermis layer of the skin only, which might suggest an exoskeletal derivation of the carapace instead. Endoskeleton versus exoskeleton: this distinction lies at the heart of the debate over the evolution of the turtle carapace, from Cuvier to the present day.

The interpretation of the turtle shell offered by Cuvier in 1817 removed some ambiguity that had persisted in his first description of the turtle carapace, published in 1799. In the latter we read, "There are eight dorsal vertebrae: they are all fused, with the ribs and the carapace, into a single immobile structure" (1799:173). This does not exactly say that the vertebrae and ribs actually make up the carapace, but rather that the vertebrae and ribs are fused with the carapace. But further in the same text, Cuvier clarified that the neural plates of the carapace are formed by the underlying vertebrae and the costal plates by a broadening of the ribs that come to meet in sutures, while the marginal plates and those of the lateral bridge he derived from the tips of the ribs (1799:211ff.). Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1884) was professor of comparative anatomy at the Paris National Natural History Museum and had been instrumental in bringing Cuvier to this institution. Unlike Cuvier, Geoffroy decided to follow Napoleon Bonaparte on his ultimately unsuccessful military campaign in Egypt, which lasted from 1798 to 1801. When Napoleon withdrew from the victorious English troops, Geoffroy was left behind in Egypt, from where he wrote desperate letters to Cuvier, asking him to help organize his return to France. Cuvier, who left Geoffroy's letters unanswered, used the time of Geoffroy's absence to consolidate his position of power at the Paris museum. Ironically, Cuvier would later use mummified animals from Egyptian tombs that Geoffroy had brought back—for example, ibis mummies—as evidence against theories of evolutionary species transformation, such as those entertained by Lamarck, and, to a more limited degree, by Geoffroy himself. Comparing the skeleton of ibis mummies with that of living ibises, Cuvier could not detect any modifications. If 3,000 years had not brought any evolutionary change, he argued, another 3,000 years would not do so either, for one could multiply 3,000 by zero as many times as one wanted; the result would always be zero! By 1830, Cuvier and Geoffroy were locked in an epic battle that played out at meetings of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris, exchanging arguments about the possibility and significance of anatomic comparisons between vertebrate and invertebrate animals that piqued interest far beyond the French borders. None other than the illustrious German polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe felt compelled to provide a detailed philosophical analysis of the debate. The dispute remained unresolved, for it came to an end with Cuvier's death in 1832 (for a detailed account of the events leading up to the Cuvier–Geoffroy debate of 1830, see Appel, 1987; for a summary, see Rieppel, 2001). In 1818, however, Geoffroy was still prepared to accept Cuvier's interpretation of the turtle shell (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1818:105n1). Earlier, in 1809, Geoffroy had published a monograph on the soft-shelled turtles, including those he had collected in Egypt, and which he described as a new species under the new genus name _Trionyx_ in the _Annales_ of the Paris National Natural History Museum (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1809). Soft-shelled turtles show a reduced carapace in that they have lost the marginal plates as well as the lateral bridge elements. This leaves the slender tips of the ribs to project from the outer margin of the costal plates—a condition that seemed to perfectly confirm Cuvier's interpretation of the turtle carapace.

But Cuvier's interpretation of the turtle shell had already met resistance and critique, in particular from German authors, as well as from the eminent Sir Richard Owen from London. In 1802, Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann (1770–1840), a gynecologist at the University of Kiel who was also known for his studies in anatomy and entomology, published a monograph on the anatomy of turtles, concentrating on the yellow-footed tortoise ( _Chelonoidis denticulata_ ) from the Amazon basin in South America. Comparing turtles to shelled mollusks, crustaceans and insects, Wiedemann noted that whereas these invertebrates only sport an outer skeleton that envelops the soft parts, turtles sport an outer as well as an inner skeleton. The outer skeleton is, of course, the turtle shell composed of carapace and plastron; the latter terms were not used by Wiedemann, however. The inner skeleton is the vertebral column, the girdle and limb bones, and the skull. Of the carapace he wrote, "The hard outer shell is composed of several bony plates that are united by true sutures, covered on the outside by a keratinous substance, and fused on the inside with part of the vertebral column and with the ribs" (Wiedemann, 1802:179). This does not say that the carapace is formed by the dorsal vertebral neural arches and ribs, but rather by bony plates—we would call them osteoderms today—that fuse with the underlying vertebrae and ribs. That interpretation renders the carapace an exoskeletal formation, not an endoskeletal formation, as it would be in Cuvier's account. A similar account to Wiedemann's was offered by Carl Gustav Carus (1789–1869), in his textbook on comparative anatomy, published in a second edition in 1834. Carus—a physician, psychologist, naturalist, philosopher, and artist—distinguished between the _Hautskelet_ , the skeletal parts that ossify in the skin ( _Haut_ is German for skin), and the _Rumpfskelet_ , the (endoskeletal) vertebrae, ribs and sternum ( _Rumpf_ is German for trunk). Both carapace and plastron he considered to be composed of elements of the _Hautskelet_ , i.e., exoskeletal elements that have fused to the underlying (endoskeletal) vertebrae and ribs (carapace), and sternum (plastron), respectively (Carus, 1834:164). Carus's interpretation of the turtle carapace was confirmed by Wilhelm Peters (1815–1883), who later became director of the zoological museum of Humboldt University in Berlin. In his PhD thesis, published in 1838, Peters confirmed the origin of carapacial plates as ossifications that form in the dermis layer of the skin, with the neural and costal plates later fusing to the underlying vertebral neural arches and ribs, respectively.

Neither Cuvier nor Geoffroy, Wiedemann, Carus, or Peters had based their interpretation of the turtle shell on embryological investigations. This is why Martin Heinrich Rathke (1793–1860) judged their work incomplete and hence their interpretations dubious. In 1835, Rathke left Dorpat to take up the position of university professor of anatomy, director of the institute of anatomy, and director of the zoological museum in Königsberg. Rathke succeeded in that position embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer, who had left the University of Königsberg the year before, in 1834. Rathke, who was thankful for having been called back to his fatherland, thus had large shoes to fill, but in the course of his career, he established himself as another eminent embryologist of the nineteenth century (Menz, 2000:69). His plan to investigate the embryonic development of turtles was motivated by the fact that "virtually nothing about this is known so far." Yet it was only through embryological investigations that one could hope to decipher "how this wondrous and puzzling anatomy could be formed" (Rathke, cited in Menz, 2000:196). Baer had pursued similar ambitions before, as he sought to illuminate what he found so peculiar about the anatomy of turtles, namely the fact that "a series of bones, which in many ways identify themselves as ribs, are not only grown together among themselves, but also cover the entire vertebral column from the neck backwards, and even enclose the root elements of the limbs" (1834:546).

In his report on turtle development, published in the year of his retirement, 1834, Baer bemoaned years of futile attempts to obtain turtle embryos suitable for investigation. In the summer of 1833, however, a turtle that had been offered to him for purchase "was so kind to drop an egg into my hand as I picked it up. 'This is an honorable pledge and valuable earnest money,'" Baer thought, and placed his new acquisition into a box filled with humid soil into which the turtle deposited additional eggs (Baer, 1834:544). It proved difficult, however, to provide the eggs with the right amount of humidity and heat to keep the embryos alive. The results Baer was able to obtain were thus rather meager, limited to the description of an embryo six days old.

In the days of Baer and Rathke, Königsberg was the capital city of East Prussia. Baer had already announced that no turtles were to be found in the surroundings of Königsberg but that a species of pond turtle he called _Emys europaea_ was found in Lithuania (Baer, 1834:544). Rathke in turn was made aware of the fact that the many lakes that adorn the landscape of southern East Prussia harbored in copious numbers European pond turtles, which (in an English abstract of his turtle work he published in 1846) Rathke referred to by the same name Baer (1846:316) had previously used, _Emys europaea_. (Today the species is known by the name under which it was first described, _Emys orbicularis_.) Rathke immediately enlisted the help of locals and traveled the region himself two times during summer to collect turtles that, he hoped, would include females carrying eggs. He brought back 26 specimens of the pond turtle, which he released into the marshy garden pond of the anatomical institute. The eggs some of these specimens would produce rotted as a result of exposure to excessive humidity, and to Rathke's chagrin, no further eggs would be forthcoming for the next eight years (Menz, 2000:198). Of nearly 100 turtle eggs sent to him, none produced any embryos, "presumably because the eggs had lost their lives due to the bumpy ride they endured on the wagons that had been used to transport them" (Rathke, cited in Menz, 2000:199). After experiencing these setbacks, Rathke turned to fellow naturalists, scientists, and even pet dealers in the hope that they would have turtle eggs and embryos in their collections. "I was lucky enough to obtain two late embryos and a number of very young turtles which collectively formed a series that allowed me in particular to investigate the development of the carapace and plastron" (Rathke, 1848:vi). In the end, Rathke succeeded in assembling a rich variety of late embryos or juveniles of turtles, including representatives of the soft-shelled turtles and sea turtles, most significantly an embryo of the green sea turtle ( _Chelonia mydas_ ), as well as a juvenile of the leatherback sea turtle ( _Dermochelys coriacea_ ). Curiously, he did not seize on the most peculiar composition of the carapace in the leatherback. The series was complemented by three eggs of _Emys europaea_ , which a friend of the medical faculty of the University of Königsberg gave him in June 1847, when his monograph was already in print. He carefully transferred the eggs to a box filled with sand, which he then exposed to the sun. The two embryos thus obtained became the subject of a special appendix to his monograph (Menz, 2000:201; see also Rathke, 1848:xiv). Relating his detailed and careful observations in the verbose, repetitive, and often contorted style typical of his scientific writing in a volume he published in 1848, Rathke forcefully refuted Carus's and Peters's accounts of the turtle shell. A commemorative speech delivered after his passing characterized Rathke's turtle work as truly masterful:

Rathke proved... that the ribs through their highly peculiar growth come to envelope the limbs and together with the vertebrae form the carapace, which then is enlarged by bony plates that develop in the skin; the plastron is in its entirety a formation of dermal ossifications, as the sternum is missing in turtles. That way Rathke's investigations brought complete and final closure to a long-lasting debate in comparative anatomy. (Zaddach, 1860:288)

In Carus's and Peters's accounts, bony plates that ossify in the dermis layer of the skin would fuse with the underlying vertebrae and ribs in the formation of the carapace (Rathke, 1848:113). No such osteoderms, nor their fusion with underlying vertebrae and ribs, was evident in any of the material Rathke had investigated. Interestingly, osteoderms do form in the carapace of the leatherback, but Rathke's specimen seems to have been at an early posthatching developmental stage, at which time the osteoderms had not yet made their appearance. Rathke also rejected Cuvier's claim that the marginal plates take their origin from the ribs. Not only did the marginal plates form quite independently, but they also differed in number from the ribs (1848:112). He did, however, recognize a fundamental difference between the neural and costal plates on the one hand and the nuchal, marginal, and pygal plates on the other, calling the latter collectively the "supplementary plates" of the carapace. The neural spines of the trunk (dorsal) vertebrae, as well as the trunk (dorsal) ribs, he found to be preformed in cartilage, yet embedded in a "dense layer of connective tissue" that directly underlies the skin (1848:57). It is within this dense layer of connective tissue that he found the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae and the dorsal ribs to ossify. Consequent to their ossification, he found additional bone to spread from the tip of the neural spines in such a way as to form a squarish, horizontally oriented plate—the neural plates that would eventually meet their neighbors in well-defined sutures. Similarly, he found the ribs to first ossify, then broaden in a horizontal plane by the continuous apposition of bone to their anterior and posterior margins. That way, the ribs would broaden to such an extent as to form the costal plates that meet their neighbors in an interdigitating suture. Clearly, then, the neural and costal plates derive from the endoskeletal vertebrae and ribs instead of representing dermal, i.e., exoskeletal, ossifications that fuse with underlying endoskeletal elements.

The same derivation from endoskeletal elements could not be claimed for what Rathke called the "supplementary plates" of the carapace. The nuchal plate—which, as he noted, is the first ossification to appear in the carapace—as well as the marginal and the pygal plates he found to form independently within a structure in the turtle embryo that he called the marginal fold. While definitively not related to ribs or vertebrae, Rathke was unable to unambiguously assess the origin of these supplementary plates—with the exception of the nuchal plate—either from a tissue resembling cartilage or from a more fibrous tissue underlying the skin (1848:111). However, in his description of the two embryos of _Emys europaea_ he had obtained in 1847, he confirmed the nuchal plate to be the only one of the supplementary plates to take its origin from a cartilaginous precursor (1848:238). He was probably driven to this erroneous conclusion by the curious two-phased ossification of the nuchal. Rathke's terminology is cumbersome, and his findings may be more easily understood when translated into modern terminology. What happens in the turtle embryo is that the carapace is first mapped out through a thickening of the dermis layer of the skin covering the back of the animal. Such thickening of the dermis layer of the skin results in the dense layer of connective tissue noted by Rathke. A recent study by Hirasawa, Nagashima, and Kuratani (2013) found this "dense layer of connective tissue" identified by Rathke not to be part of the dermis layer of the skin but rather to represent a deeper layer of tissue in which, in other tetrapods, the muscles develop that lie between the ribs. The result is the appearance of a carapacial disk, and it is within this carapacial disk that the elements of the carapace will ossify. Just as the ossified carapace, the carapacial disk has a well-defined subcircular or circular margin, which in the embryonic condition is called the carapacial ridge. This carapacial ridge is what corresponds to Rathke's marginal fold, and it is within this marginal fold that he observed the nuchal, the pygal, and the marginal plates of the carapace to ossify.

Another illustrious author who set out to investigate the nature of the turtle shell was Sir Richard Owen, who published his results in the esteemed _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London_ , the oldest scientific periodical still in existence, with the first issue appearing in 1665. The carapace, "this seemingly special and anomalous superaddition to the ordinary vertebrate structure," Owen noted, "is due, in a great degree, to the modification of form and size, and, in a less degree, to a change of relative position, of ordinary elements of the vertebrate skeleton" (1849:151). These changes Owen recognized as being precisely of the kind that would obscure relations of homology, thus rendering a detailed anatomical comparison of turtles with other reptiles difficult. The first relevant attempt to decipher the homologies in the turtle shell Owen traced back to Cuvier's _Leçons d'Anatomie Comparée_ of 1799. In contrast, Owen found the interpretation of the turtle shell offered by Carus to have been "neither explained in detail nor supported by any fact of development" (1849:155). On Owen's reading, Rathke had considered the carapace an endoskeletal structure, except for the marginal plates, which he had ascribed to the exoskeleton. These marginal plates Rathke had considered not to be essential parts of the carapace, however, as they are absent in the leatherback sea turtle as also in soft-shelled turtles: "The special deductions by RATHKE will be compared... with my own observations on the development of the carapace in the _Chelonia_ ," Owen proclaimed (Owen, 1849:156). In the discussions of the nature of the turtle shell, Owen was the first to consistently distinguish between endo- and exoskeletal components. As already explained, homology is a correspondence relation between homologues, i.e., between parts (organs or organ systems) considered to be homologous in two or more different organisms (Brigandt, 2002). To ask which are the homologies in the turtle carapace therefore also implies the question of which other organisms turtles should be compared to in the search for homologies. Here Owen opted for crocodiles, with which he thought turtles to share the closest affinities among reptiles (much as the DNA data suggest today). And again, as already noted, crocodiles are characterized by the development of thick osteoderms, which results in the richly structured skin that covers their back. There is, then, in crocodiles a well-developed layer of exoskeletal ossifications superimposed on, but not fused with, the underlying endoskeletal trunk vertebrae and ribs. Naturally, such a comparison with crocodiles would color Owen's interpretation of the turtle carapace: "The neural plates, the costal plates, and the marginal plates, whether attached to the vertebral elements or detached, are lodged in the substance of the derm[is], and form a stratum of bones superficial to the ossified parts of the endo-skeleton" (1849:161). To cite more fully Owen's conclusions, just with respect to the neural plates while bearing in mind that the very same conclusion would apply to the ribs and costal plates, gives a stronger sense of what he was driving at: "The [vertebral] centrum and the neural arch supporting the neural plate are parts the homologies of which admit of no question, and have given rise to none; but the neural plate itself is a dermal bone homologous with the medial dermal scutes of the Crocodile's back-shield, but connate in some of the dorsal segments with the true neural spine in the _Chelonia_ " (1849:165).

In summary, then, there had been articulated two alternative interpretations of the carapace since these early phases of discussion of the turtle shell. Disregarding the plastron as of less importance in the current context, one side in the debate took the elements of the carapace to be of exoskeletal origin, homologous to the osteoderms of other reptiles, some of them (i.e., the neural and costal plates) secondarily fused with underlying elements of the endoskeleton (i.e., with the dorsal vertebrae [neural arches] and ribs). The other side emphasized the endoskeletal nature of the carapace, especially of its central components, the neural and costal plates. Recognizing the erroneous nature of Rathke's tentative derivation of the nuchal and marginal plates from cartilaginous precursors, and siding with Owen in that particular respect, the carapace can also be seen as a composite structure: the neural and costal plates are endoskeletal and the nuchal, pygal, and marginal plates are exoskeletal in their origin. It is fair to say that the discussion of the nature of the carapace continued to move between these alternative interpretations all the way into the twenty-first century. The interesting thing here is that the discussion could only continue to move between these alternative hypotheses for so long because important additional observations and arguments were being ignored. The latter emerged from an attempt, initiated by Cope in 1871 and subsequently pursued mostly by paleontologists, to tie the interpretation of the carapace more closely to the evolutionary history of turtles, and in that context also to identify what could count as the most primitive condition of the carapace among fossil and extant turtles known at the time. The most crucial role to play in that respect fell to the leatherback sea turtle because of the peculiar nature of the body armor that covers its back.

A carapace is clearly delineated in the leatherback, making it immediately identifiable as a turtle. The embryo of _Dermochelys_ consequently also develops a distinct carapacial disk. What is peculiar, though, is the way ossification proceeds in the carapacial disk of the leatherback. Its scientific name, _Dermochelys_ , combines the term _dermis_ , for the thickened dermis layer of the skin marking out the carapace, with the term _chelys_ , identifying the animal as a chelonian, a turtle. At the front end of the carapace sits the ossified nuchal plate, the element that also is the first to ossify in the carapace of turtles more generally. Neural plates are absent in the leatherback, however. The ribs fan out into the dermal carapace and are horizontally somewhat broadened, but only slightly so, leaving ample space between them. They do not meet their neighbors along their length in a well-defined suture, as is the case in true costal plates. In that respect, the ossified ribs of the adult leatherback resemble the cartilaginous ribs of embryos of other turtles. Isolated ossifications along the posterior margin of the carapace of the leatherback have tentatively been compared to marginal plates of other turtles. These are all the ossifications in the carapace of the leatherback that compare to those in the carapace of other turtles. That is not to say, however, that the leatherback is left without a robust bony covering of its back. The carapace in fact includes a layer of osteoderms, small polygonal ossifications that form in the thickened dermis above the dorsal vertebrae and ribs, without fusing with these underlying endoskeletal elements. The osteoderms in the carapace of the leatherback form a closed shield, as they meet in interdigitating sutures, thus forming a structure that closely resembles the carapace of armored placodonts. It is on the basis of a comparison with the leatherback that the early authors misidentified the cyamodontoid placodont _Psephoderma_ from the Middle Triassic of Bavaria as an extinct sea turtle.

It is also the peculiar nature of its carapace that motivated Cope to classify the leatherback and its fossil relatives as representatives of the Athecae, a name that translates as "turtles without a theca," i.e., without a typical carapace. This evolutionary lineage he contrasted with the Cryptodira, a group that in his view would comprise all other turtles, all of them with a properly developed carapace, or theca (Cope, 1871:235). Cope's classification of turtles therefore does not recognize the cryptodire–pleurodire distinction that we draw today, based on the mode of head retraction and jaw adductor system, and for that reason is deficient by modern standards. Nevertheless, in his revision of Cope's terminology published in 1886, paleontologist Louis Dollo (1857–1931) from the Royal Natural History Museum of Belgium retained Cope's term Athecae for the leatherback and its kin while placing all other turtles in a group Dollo called Thecophora. These early discussions surrounding the anatomy of the leatherback and its consequent classification generated a number of important questions and insights.

First, it was realized that the carapace in the leatherback is of a fundamentally different osseous structure than that of other turtles. The nuchal plate and possibly posterior marginal plates were recognized as the only elements that compare to the carapace of other turtles, while the slight broadening of the dorsal ribs in the leatherback recalls an embryonic condition observed in other turtles. Other turtles lack the extensive osteoderm covering that is present in the leatherback. The question thus arises, what is the primitive condition for turtles? Is it the presence of a typical bony carapace—mostly lost in the leatherback and replaced by an osteoderm covering—or is the condition observed in _Dermochelys_ to be taken as the primitive condition for turtles in general? In modern analyses, the leatherback does not come out as a basal, primitive turtle, while early fossil turtles already had a fully developed osseous carapace. The latter must thus have been lost in the leatherback, with the loss compensated for by an extensive osteoderm covering—a conclusion that had been reached by Baur in 1888, in opposition to Cope and Dollo. This conclusion is in accordance with the fact that the shell is reduced in its degree of ossification in other sea turtles as well, although never to the extent observed in the leatherback. It is indeed a quite general observation that those reptiles, which secondarily invade the sea to make it their permanent habitat, show a reduction in the degree of ossification in various parts of their skeleton compared to their terrestrial relatives. Such a reduction in ossification may affect different parts of the skeleton to different degrees and is probably an expression of a reduced gravitational pull in the aquatic environment. However, and significantly, whereas Baur recognized _Dermochelys_ "as the most specialized of the sea-turtles," he nevertheless took the structure of its dermal armor as a model of the primitive, "protochelonian" condition (Baur, 1888:144). The leather-back, according to his view, did not represent the primitive condition of carapace formation but instead exemplified it.

The distinction of Athecae from Thecophora drawn by Dollo carried even more profound implications. It was Baur again who drew attention to an observation previously published in 1872 by Paul Gervais (1816–1879), a comparative anatomist working at the Paris National Natural History Museum. Gervais had noted that the anterior osteoderms in the carapace of the leatherback overlap the (anteriorly positioned) nuchal plate (Baur, 1886:688). Because the nuchal plate was recognized as an element that occurs in the carapace of all turtles, this had to mean that the osteoderms in the carapace of _Dermochelys_ ossified in a more superficial layer of the skin than the nuchal plate. The more general conclusion drawn by Oliver Perry Hay (1846–1930) in a paper from 1898 was that the bony plates that contribute to the dorsal armor in turtles derive from two distinct layers of ossification within the thickened tissue of what today is called the carapacial disk. According to Hay, the outer layer of ossification produced true dermal bone in the form of osteoderms, as are present in the leatherback. The inner layer of ossification produced what Hay called fascial bone that makes up the elements in the true carapace, such as the nuchal, neural, pygal, costal, and marginal plates. The next chapter in the turtle shell saga was the introduction of a new terminology in 1913, where carapacial elements of the inner layer of ossification were called "thecal," with these elements collectively forming the theca (Völker, 1913). Elements of the outer layer, i.e., the osteoderm layer, were called "epithecal," with them correspondingly forming the epitheca. In the classic case of the leatherback, the nuchal plate is an element of the theca, whereas the osteoderm covering forms the epitheca—consistent with the fact that anterior osteoderms overlap the nuchal plate. Following that terminological distinction, there emerged a general consensus that the epithecal ossifications are truly of dermal origin, ossifying in the dermis layer of the skin and hence exoskeletal in nature. The dispute now centered on the nature of the thecal ossifications, not just the nuchal plate, but more importantly, the neural and costal plates in the carapace. Consider the case of certain fossil sea turtles, with a perfectly developed carapace comprising neural and costal plates, but on top of which isolated and scattered osteoderms are superimposed, as may also be the case in the pleurodire genus _Chelus_. With the undisputed acknowledgment that such osteoderms represent epithecal ossifications of dermal, i.e., exoskeletal, origin, it became difficult to claim that the thecal elements such as the neural and costal plates were derived from dermal ossifications as well, representing a first generation of osteoderms, so to speak, that would fuse with underlying endoskeletal elements, i.e., the dorsal vertebrae and ribs. Such an interpretation would require the formation of two successive generations of osteoderms, the first one positioned deep to the second one, and only osteoderms of the first generation fusing with underlying endoskeletal elements. With turtle shells that comprise neural, costal, and marginal plates, as well as osteoderms superimposed on the neurals and costals, the further question arose as to whether the marginal plates are first- or second-generation osteoderms. The "duplicity theory" of the turtle carapace that was built on the distinction of thecal and epithecal ossifications in the carapace, and in particular the nature of the neural and costal plates as either of exo- or endoskeletal derivation, remained a matter of dispute well into the twenty-first century (Kälin, 1945:145). However, as long as the leatherback could still be considered either as a surviving offshoot from the primitive stock leading to turtles or as a specialized turtle that nonetheless provides a model for an ancestral turtle, it seemed appropriate to hypothesize that the evolution of the carapace would have started with ancestral turtles that developed a loose osteoderm covering over an incompletely developed theca. Such was indeed proposed by Jan Versluys, who was also the first to illustrate such a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor adorned with osteoderms scattered across its back (Versluys, 1914). In the Athecae, he argued, i.e., in the leatherback and its kin, the osteoderm covering was perfected to form a closed shield at the expense of the theca, which remained undeveloped except for the nuchal plate and a modest broadening of the ribs. In contrast, in the Thecophora, the osteoderm covering was lost after the evolution of a complete theca comprising neural and costal plates.

Removal of the leatherback from its basal position in the turtle tree—a position that had still been accepted by Versluys—did not diminish the intuitive appeal of those early evolutionary scenarios. Given the broad distribution of osteoderms across reptiles in general, it continued to seem appropriate to hypothesize that the evolution of the carapace would have started with ancestral turtles developing an osteoderm covering. These osteoderms would then have coalesced to form the larger plates characteristic of the carapace (theca), with the neural and costal plates then fusing with the underlying dorsal vertebrae and ribs. However, this intuitively appealing vision could not, and still cannot, be reconciled with two observations that were first reported by Rathke as early as 1849, and that in numerous succeeding studies of the embryonic development of the carapace have stood the test of time: it is a fact that turtle embryos never show any sign of a secondary fusion of bony plates ossifying in the dermis layer of the skin with underlying endoskeletal elements such as the dorsal vertebral neural arches and ribs, and it is also a fact that the ossification of the neural and costal plates continuously spreads from perichondral bone that forms around the dorsal vertebral neural arches and ribs, which are first preformed in cartilage. These observations identify the neural and costal plates as endoskeletal elements, in contrast to the exoskeletal nature of the other plates that complete the turtle carapace. On that interpretation, the turtle carapace is indeed a dual structure, combining endo- and exoskeletal elements in a way that is unique among vertebrates (for an extensive technical review of these issues, see Rieppel, 2013c).

The debate surrounding the evolution of the turtle shell will be revisited below in an account of the social construction of the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor, dotted, as it were, by scattered osteoderms believed to represent the first step in the evolution of a carapace. Social construction means that the arguments about the origin and early evolution of turtles and their shell are resolved not through new discoveries or investigations but through consensus building among a group of collaborating scientists. The early arguments concerning the origin of the turtle shell as sketched above have laid the foundation for such a social construction of the turtle ancestor, but they have not illuminated a more pressing issue in the present discussion, and that is how the shoulder blade of turtles came to be positioned inside the rib cage. Recall Herbert Ruckes, who dismissed D. M. S. Watson's idea that the scapula came to lie inside the rib cage in turtles as a result of a posterior dislocation of the pectoral girdle. What Ruckes was able to show in his prizewinning studies was that the turtle shoulder girdle has never been displaced posteriorly. Indeed, it is not the scapula that changes its position at all. Instead, he found the ribs to have changed their position relative to the shoulder blade. The ribs are endoskeletal structures that grow out from cartilaginous rudiments that are associated with the vertebrae on which the ribs will eventually articulate. In tetrapods generally, the ribs of the trunk grow out curving downward into the body wall in a way that places them internal to the scapula. In turtles, the dorsal ribs grow out from the vertebrae in a novel direction, one that takes them to a position outside the scapula. Rucke's prizewinning discoveries can be summarized as follows: the association of the primordial rudiments of the ribs with a thickened carapacial dermis, and the ribs growing in a more or less horizontal direction, are associated with the lateral growth and radial expansion of the carapacial dermis as the formation of the carapacial disk continues. That way, the scapula (and with it the shoulder girdle) comes to lie inside the turtle shell, positioned below the first costal plate that takes its origin from the first dorsal rib. The turtle shell thus represents a true evolutionary novelty, unique in its nature among vertebrate animals.

Old Genes Perform New Tricks

The first modern study that tackled Ruckes's conclusions experimentally was performed in the 1980s by a graduate student at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, Ann C. Burke, now a professor at Wesleyan University. In her own words, modern developmental models of the carapace "begin with a 1929 descriptive study by Ruckes that in part inspired my thesis work" (Burke, 2015:83). The 1980s were the heydays of the first blossoming of evolutionary developmental biology, with Stephen Jay Gould—also from Harvard—deploring the incompleteness of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory. The modern synthesis, hammered out in the mid-twentieth century, had indeed brought previously disparate areas of research together, most prominently population biology, population genetics, and paleontology. But, Gould complained, it had failed to properly incorporate developmental biology and its genetic underpinning. As we have seen in the last chapter, Gould raised issues that had previously been addressed by Goldschmidt. With Gould and a number of other authors pushing the agenda for evolutionary developmental research in the 1980s, talk of macroevolution, and possibly of saltational evolutionary change, was no longer immediately dismissed as heresy, as it had been in the 1950s and 1960s, the heyday of the modern synthesis. While Burke sliced up turtle embryos into ultrathin sections to study their cellular structure under the microscope, a fellow student in the same lab investigated the origin of the novel joint that splits the upper jaw of the Round Island boa in two halves—the very structure which in the previous chapter was identified as the most cited example of a hopeful monster. Both were graduate students under the same supervisor, Pere Alberch (1954–1998) (Wake, 1998). Alberch was a pioneer in evo-devo research, who among other things took up an interest that had also been prominently pursued by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's son, Isodore: the classification of monstrosities. Why is it that malformations are not of a purely random nature but instead can be classified? (Alberch, 1989). You can get a turtle—or a salamander, or a lizard—with two heads sitting on the shoulders, but you'll never get a turtle with an extra leg sprouting from the middle of its back. The fact that monstrosities can be classified implies that not all malformations are possible—that there exist so-called forbidden morphologies. This in turn calls into question the Darwinian assumption of fundamental variation (discussed in chapter 3) and invokes the theory that developmental constraints render some developmental pathways impossible.

When Burke investigated the cellular structure of the carapacial disk and its outer margin, the carapacial ridge, in turtle embryos, she was struck by some cellular differentiation she had seen elsewhere. Those cells of the epidermis, i.e., of the outer layer of the skin, which line the margin of the carapacial disk, i.e., which form the carapacial ridge, show a distinctly specialized structure. They are conspicuously tall and slender, looking strikingly similar to those epidermal cells that form the outer margin, or outer edge, of a tetrapod limb bud. The limb bud forms when the limbs first start to sprout from the body wall of the embryo. The epidermal cells aligned along the limb bud's outer margin (technically called the apical ectodermal ridge) show a similar tall and slender structure to the epidermal cells aligned along the carapacial ridge. The tetrapod limb, and its early developmental stage, the limb bud, has been at the center of intensive experimental developmental research for decades. Tetrapod limb development was also, again in the 1980s, the subject of another graduate student research project in Pere Alberch's lab at the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Shubin and Alberch, 1986). Experiments performed on the tetrapod limb bud had revealed a most important organizing role performed by these specialized epidermis cells in the apical ectodermal ridge during limb development. Boas and pythons, with their much-reduced hind limbs, provide a natural experiment. Boa and python embryos show typical posterior limb buds sprouting during early developmental stages, but then, early on in development, the epidermal cells in the apical ectodermal ridge undergo necrosis and die. Limb development consequently comes to a halt, leaving the hind limbs in a most rudimentary stage of differentiation that persists into adulthood. Recognizing a similar cellular differentiation of the epidermis in the carapacial ridge, Burke set out to test whether these might likewise play some organizing role in the development of the carapace. Indeed, she found that it is under some sort of instruction from the carapacial ridge, emanating from an epithelial mesenchymal interaction between the specialized epidermis cells and the underlying dermis, that the growth of the ribs is redirected (Burke, 1989).

More recent work on the development of the turtle carapace has targeted both its genetic underpinning and its morphological differentiation. This work was pursued predominantly in labs in the United States and in Japan, respectively. Given their different locations, researchers have used different turtle species in their studies, with the North American ones using hard-shelled species and the Japanese ones using soft-shelled species. On the basis of that body of work, two different models of carapace development have been proposed (for a review and references, see Rice at al., 2015).

As the early turtle embryo starts to take shape, the fore- and hind limbs start to sprout from the lateral body wall: the limb buds make their appearance. Then the carapacial ridge makes its first appearance, at first forming a ridge of thickened epidermis that is located just above the limb buds, and bridging the distance between them. During subsequent development, the ridges expand both in an anterior and posterior direction, crossing over the back until the ridges of either side of the body come to meet in a closed circle. That way, the circumference of the carapacial disk is completed. In tetrapods generally, the ribs grow downward into the lateral body wall, thus forming a rib cage that encases the lungs. Such is not the case in turtles, however, for reasons that remain debated. In hard-shelled turtles, the reorientation of rib growth was found to result from an attraction of the rib precursor cells to the carapacial ridge. As a consequence, the ribs become ensnared in the dermis of the carapacial ridge. Researchers using soft-shelled turtles considered the fact that the ribs of turtles do not just grow straight laterally; the anterior ribs grow in an anterolateral direction and the posterior ribs grow in a posterolateral direction. This fan-shaped or radiating pattern of ribs they attribute to the influence of the carapacial ridge. Below the carapacial disk, the body wall was found to fold up in a peculiar way, shifting the appendicular skeleton to a position below the ribs (Nagashima et al., 2009). The differences in development are also reflected in different gene expression patterns observed in the carapacial ridge of hard- and soft-shelled turtles. The question remains whether those two different models of carapace formation reflect taxonomic diversity or result from different techniques of investigation. The most recent review of the debate concluded, "There is more than one way to make a turtle shell" (Rice et al., 2015:6). This is remarkable, given the monophyly of the turtle lineage, as well as the carapace as one of its most telling diagnostic features. But either way, restricting the growth of the ribs to a largely horizontal plane (technically the primaxial domain) has important consequences for all turtles (Shearman and Burke, 2009; Burke, 2009). First, the cartilaginous ribs come to lie in the deep dermis layer of the skin that forms the carapacial disk, or else just below it. Second, because the carapacial ridge is a nearly circular structure, the outgrowing ribs will be arranged in a fanlike manner. Anterior ribs will not point straight laterally but will instead trend anterolaterally; posterior ribs will similarly trend posterolaterally. The anteriormost rib therefore does not grow straight laterally but rather somewhat anterolaterally in the direction of the forelimb, and thus comes to lie in a position above, i.e., dorsal to, the scapula. The shoulder blade is thus technically located inside the rib cage, i.e., inside the carapace. (For a more detailed and technical account, see Gilbert, Cebra-Thomas, and Burke, 2008; Hirasawa, Nagashima, and Kuratani, 2013; and references therein. There is also a nice recent summary of that research in Wagner, 2014:179ff.)

Once fully formed, the cartilaginous ribs begin to ossify, a process by which cartilage is replaced by bone, as is typical of any endoskeletal element. During that process, the rib cartilage releases a molecular signal that incites the formation of bone by competent cells in neighboring tissue. The first step in rib ossification is the deposition of bone on the surface of the cartilaginous rib. This initial bone (perichondral bone, destined to form the periosteum of the ossified rib) eventually forms a solid mineralized sheath for the rib cartilage. While the rib cartilage itself is being eroded away and replaced by bone (endochondral bone), bone continues to be deposited within the dermis of the carapacial disk along the anterior and posterior margin of the ossifying rib. That way, bone formation spreads out from the rib in a horizontal plane along both its anterior and posterior edge. A debate surrounds the question as to whether the expansion of what will become the costal plate is strictly mediated by the periosteum of the ossified rib or whether there is an accretion of bone formed in neighboring tissue to the ossified rib (see discussion in Rice et al., 2015:9). Either way, the result is an increasing width of the "rib" until the costal plate is complete, meeting the neighboring plates in well-defined sutures. The costal plate is not preformed in cartilage in its entirety, only its central part that is constituted by the cartilaginous rib. From a developmental biologist's perspective, the costal plate (as also the neural plate) is consequently a composite structure, composed of chondral bone that encases and eventually replaces the original cartilaginous rib, to which is added intramembranous, or dermal, bone, i.e., bone forming in the dermis layer of the carapacial disk (Gilbert, Cebra-Thomas, and Burke, 2008:6). This developmental perspective takes into account the fact that two different types of bone, which form on the basis of different molecular stimulation, contribute to the costal (and neural) plates. Indeed, debate is still ongoing about the source of the cells that contribute bone to the costal plates, highlighting the possibility that different species of turtles might recruit different cells to complete the costal plates (see discussion in Lubick, 2013; Rice et al., 2015).

From a phylogenetic perspective, which emphasizes the historical, i.e., evolutionary, distinctiveness of endo- and exoskeleton discussed above, such intramembranous bone that spreads from the ossification of an element preformed in cartilage and thus enlarging it is called _Zuwachsknochen_ , a term that translates into "incremental bone" (Starck, 1979:13). An element that includes incremental bone is considered to be endoskeletal in nature. The reason for this is that bony elements, which are formed through the ossification of an endoskeletal element initially preformed in cartilage, to which is then added incremental bone, are not evolved from elements that in the ancestral condition developed at the interface of the dermis and epidermis layers of the skin.

Remember the scales of trout and salmon. These bony scales are thin and translucent, and they ossify directly in the dermis layer of the skin. Compared to the ancestral condition, these scales have in the course of evolution lost the dentin and enamel layers that are primitively part of the exoskeleton. The scales in the distant ancestors of trout and salmon were three layered, composed of bone, dentin, and enamel, and must therefore have developed at the interface of the dermis and epidermis in the skin. The scales of salmon and trout are therefore homologous to scales that, in the ancestral condition, developed at the dermis–epidermis interface, although they themselves no longer do so. For an ossification to be identified as exoskeletal, that bony element must either develop as a three-layered structure at the dermis–epidermis interface in the skin, or it must be homologous to an element that did, in the ancestral condition, develop at this ectoderm–mesoderm interface.

Conversely, an endoskeletal element cannot be one that is homologous to an element that in the ancestral condition developed at the interface of dermis and epidermis in the skin. It is true that the neural and costal plates in the turtle carapace both develop through the addition of intramembranous bone, but that incremental bone enlarges an element that is originally preformed in cartilage before it undergoes ossification. The neural and costal plates in the turtle carapace therefore cannot be derived, evolutionarily, from ancestral structures that once in the distant past were composed of bone, dentin, and enamel, and hence originally developed at the interface of dermis and epidermis in the skin. Such incremental bone enhances structures which in the ancestral condition were—or still are, at least in part—preformed in cartilage; hence the endoskeletal nature of the _Zuwachsknochen_. In conclusion, then, it can be restated that the turtle carapace combines endoskeletal (neural and costal plates) and exoskeletal (nuchal, pygal, and marginal plates) elements in a novel way that is unique among tetrapods, and indeed among vertebrates.

Remember Ann C. Burke, whose interest in the development of the turtle shell was piqued when she discovered that the epidermal cells along the carapacial ridge look similar to the epidermal cells lining the outer (apical) margin of the limb bud. What she found is that these cells along the carapacial ridge play an important organizing role in the formation of the carapace. Perhaps the most interesting part of this story is the recently discovered fact that several genes that are active at the outer margin of the limb bud (in the apical ectodermal ridge) are also expressed in the carapacial ridge. It thus seems that genes that regulate limb development in tetrapods have been co-opted to regulate carapace (rib) development in the carapacial ridge of turtles. There is some controversy around this issue, as there is around the precise function of the carapacial ridge, a discussion that might be due to different turtle species being used in different studies conducted by different authors, but as was eloquently stated in a review, "Underlying the unique presence of the carapacial ridge and its influence on the formation of the carapace are a host of genes and specific tissues that have been co-opted from those associated with the adjacent limb buds" (Carroll, 2013:30).

The expression domain and the function of these co-opted genes have been altered in a unique way, however, so as to influence the growth of the ribs in turtles. Developmental biologist Scott Gilbert, professor at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, has invoked the small tool kit metaphor, where the tools are few but versatile in their function, to explain such and similar situations. The tools in this case are the genes, but as the case of turtles illuminates, the same genes can do different things in different contexts or locations. Not every evolutionary innovation requires a totally new set of genes. It is obviously entirely possible to recruit old genes, which, in a different context and location, can perform new tricks. "Turtles seem to accomplish their remarkable anatomical and physiological feats using the same basic set of genes as their amniote relatives.... Evolution generates its novelties by tinkering with existing genes" (Gilbert and Corfe, 2013:328).

The Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor

Old genes performing new tricks in a different context and location is a classic mechanism of evolutionary innovation. The origin of a carapacial ridge between and slightly above the anterior and posterior limb buds, its completion to form a near-circular structure, the folding of the body wall, the redirection of rib growth into the carapacial ridge, and their subsequent incorporation into the osseous carapace—these are all aspects of a classic case of evolutionary innovation. Innovation here does not mean the mere transformation of an ancestral structure into a modified, descendant one, but rather means the emergence of an evolutionary novelty through the reprogramming of embryonic development, resulting in the formation of the carapace, the hallmark of a novel body plan. In the previous chapter, this emergentist paradigm of macroevolutionary change was contrasted with the transformationist paradigm, one that seeks the gradual transformation of adult structures from one generation to the next through variation and natural selection, and thus explains macroevolutionary change on the basis of extended microevolutionary processes. One of the major differences between the emergentist and transformationist paradigm is that the latter, but not necessarily the former, allows, or even seeks, to arrange adult organisms in a transformation series of ancestral and descendant conditions of form putatively documenting continuous morphological change. That way the ancestral and descendant conditions of form are bridged by an unbroken series of intermediate steps, as is required according to the Darwinian theory of evolution through variation and natural selection. Such intermediate steps of evolutionary change may sometimes be gleaned from the fossil record and sometimes from embryonic development. It may be the case that an intermediate step of evolutionary transformation is documented by an actual fossil or in a certain developmental stage of living organisms. It has indeed often been the case that an intermediate stage of evolutionary transformation was first recognized in the embryonic development of modern organisms and then was later found to be represented in the fossil record as well. One such surprising case is the turtle carapace, as will be discussed in the next chapter. In cases where both of these potential sources of information—embryos and fossils—remain mute with respect to transitional steps of evolutionary change, comparative anatomists wedded to the transformationist paradigm may theoretically reconstruct such intermediate stages of change.

To theoretically reconstruct, i.e., to invent or imagine, scientifically relevant evidence may sound highly problematic, but is indeed characteristic of early stages of theory construction in many examples. Remember the theoretical concept of the switch gene that preceded the discovery of _Hox_ genes. There has indeed been a deep philosophical discussion of this issue, especially in German philosophy and comparative anatomy of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The task of natural science was at that time universally believed to be the search for laws of nature. Such natural laws were thought to be revealed through the observation of regularity in certain phenomena, i.e., a regularity of events, or of processes that tie together cause and effect. Same cause, same effect; it is the observed regularity of phenomena that was believed to allow the inference of underlying lawfulness. The laws of nature that were at the center of scientific inquiry are thus revealed to be causal laws, i.e., laws that link cause to effect. A rock picked up will always fall back to the ground. To pick up a stone is the cause; its falling back on earth is the effect of it having been picked up. The law of gravity is the causal explanation for such regularity of the phenomena.

If, in comparative anatomy, forms can be arranged in a series in a way that seems to disclose gradual transformation, then the very fact that forms can be arranged in this way discloses a regularity that calls for a causal explanation. Fossil horses, for example, can be arranged in a series that documents the successive, stepwise reduction of digits in hands and feet, until only one digit—the third—remains, bearing a hoof. Such a series does not necessarily represent horse evolution, which is much more complex than a mere string of ancestors and descendants, but it does illustrate the gradual evolution of the limbs in horses. More generally speaking, if such a graded series of forms is one of successive embryonic stages, the regularity displayed by the series is explained by the causes that guide embryonic development. If a graded series of forms is composed of a number of species, then the inferred cause that is believed to reign over the entire series of form conditions is gradual evolutionary transformation driven by variation and natural selection.

Now, assume a case where there is a distinct gap in such a continuous series of forms. Assume that a series of embryonic stages of a turtle species has been assembled, both early and late, although a couple of intermediate stages are missing. If the stages available all represent the same turtle species, it seems uncontroversial to reconstruct the missing intermediate stages on the basis of what is known from the available antecedent and subsequent stages. The same is true of a series of species where a couple of intermediate forms are missing. Among lizards, for example, especially among scincid lizards, there are examples of species that can be arranged in a series documenting the gradual reduction of limbs, correlated with a gradual body elongation (Sanger and Gibson-Brown, 2004). There might be a number of species that form the beginning of a series revealing gradual transformation, and additional species that continue the same series, but the latter are separated from the first by a distinct anatomical gap. If anatomical comparison reveals all species under consideration to be part of the same transformation series, albeit one interrupted by a gap, then the assumption is still that the same cause reigns over the entire series—evolution by variation and natural selection. It is the assumption of such continuous underlying causality reigning over the entire series that licenses the invention or imagination of intermediate forms to fill in the gap. The problem here is not so much the invention or imagination, i.e., theoretical reconstruction, of intermediate forms.

Natural sciences are said to be, or are required to be, objective. They are supposed to paint an objective picture of the world—to capture the world as it really is. Natural sciences are also said to be self-correcting. To err, to make (honest) mistakes, is human nature. Should a scientist publish results that are erroneous, for whichever reason, the expectation is that colleagues will sooner or later find out and publish a correction. The belief that science must strive to be objective and self-correcting is anchored in the requirement that scientific results must be reproducible. This is most easily understood in experimental sciences, where the same cause is expected to link to the same effect, always and everywhere. When chemists or physicists report on their discoveries, they are required to carefully describe the experimental setup and the procedural protocol in a way that must allow any fellow scientist to repeat that experiment, and confirm, or alternatively disconfirm, the previously obtained results. One of the most spectacular mistaken scientific claims made during the last decades was the case of cold fusion. The claim here was the possibility to have a nuclear reaction play out at room temperature, as opposed to hot fusion, as occurs in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. If the possibility of cold fusion were pointing to reality, it could be one of the most important discoveries of modern physics—important enough such that the mere prospect of its actually being real keeps modest research efforts lingering.

However, as explained in Wikipedia, cold fusion has been rejected by the mainstream scientific community because the original experimental results could not be replicated consistently and reliably, and because there is no accepted theoretical model of cold fusion (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion>, accessed June 20, 2016). It has further been suggested that the original report on cold fusion, dating back to 1989, represented a case of "pathological science," where pathological science is "the science of things that aren't so" (Langmuir, 1989:36). Analyzing experiments that had gone bitterly wrong in spite of the fact that the scientists had honestly given their fair best, Nobel laureate Irving Langmuir (1881–1957), who coined the term "pathological science," explained, "These are cases where there is no dishonesty involved but where people are tricked into false results by a lack of understanding about what human beings can do to themselves in the way of being led astray by subjective effects, wishful thinking, or threshold interactions" (1989:43). Wishful thinking and consequent self-deception can happen to anybody, anytime. I remember a case where, early in my career, I drew a lizard skull as accurately as I could, thereby identifying a bone that simply was not there. What is more important is that published results from scientific exploration can be tested—and found to be false, should such be the case. Because experimental sciences, such as chemistry and physics, deal with processes that—in general and within certain limits—are reproducible, such testing of published results is routine, especially if they are deemed suspicious for one reason or another. In sciences that are not experimental, the confirmation or falsification of any purported insight or theory is much harder. Think of economics: although economists work with highly sophisticated mathematical models, their theories are much harder to test, and to verify or falsify, compared to experimental procedures in chemistry and physics. If this were not so, we would all stand a good chance of making millions playing the stock market.

Testing theories of comparative anatomy or comparative embryology is likewise hugely messy. Comparative anatomy weighs the degrees of similarity or dissimilarity of organs or organ systems in the plants or animals under comparison, but many say that similarity ultimately lies in the eye of the beholder. What looks similar to one investigator may look dissimilar to another. People who go to the zoo expect to see crocodiles in the reptile house, along with turtles, lizards, and snakes. The birds, in contrast, have their own birdhouse. But among zoologists and paleontologists, there has been vigorous and protracted debate as to whether crocodiles should be classified in a group that also includes lizards but does not include birds, or whether crocodiles should be classified in a group that also includes birds but does not include lizards. At the root of this debate lie different measures of similarity. What is being measured, i.e., the lizard, the crocodile, or the bird on the dissecting table, is the same to all participants in the debate. But how similarity should be measured—this is where the disagreement arises. It is the same old salmon–lungfish–cow problem all over again, one that was touched on in chapters 1 and . The earlier discussion of that problem moved in the context of what was called the cladistic revolution, i.e., a reorientation of biological systematics along new methodological rules that differed from those that had been adopted in the past. The claim that the lungfish is more closely related to the cow than to the salmon was defended with reference to a newly introduced method that was to be used to measure evolutionary relationships, i.e., to reconstruct phylogeny. But methods, and the rules and rulers they prescribe, are not things observed in nature. They are instead things that scientists, or groups of scientists, collectively agree on, then collectively apply to nature. Remember science philosopher Karl R. Popper, who compared the scientific community, or competing parts thereof, to a jury. In the cladistic revolution, competing groups of scientists—the conservative and the progressive—would form adverse juries: they would get on the telephone, lobby to form interest groups, and establish new professional societies that would publish new journals, in defense and support of their competing views. Put that way, the picture that science paints of the world is one that is no longer only and entirely determined by objective observation. This is because those observations will be evaluated, and will gain significance, only in light of methods that are subject to political maneuvering among scientists and their struggle for financial support from foundations and granting agencies. At the end of the day, what counts is a collective agreement among groups of scientists to use one but not the other method in the evaluation of observations. What this all boils down to is the idea, forcefully defended by a number of philosophers of science, that the picture that some sciences paint of the world is certainly not entirely, but sometimes to a remarkable degree, socially constructed.

Comparative anatomy is notorious for carrying on endless debates about potential homology relations and their significance for the reconstruction of the tree of life. The endless debates about the evolutionary relationships of turtles are just one notorious example among many. Historians of science have recorded a general disenchantment among biologists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with comparative anatomy and its application in a research program that seeks to decipher evolutionary relationships (Nyhart, 2002). This was because there seemed to be no way to call for a stringent test of alternative theories about evolutionary relationships, or of a stringent test of proposed homology relations on which these theories are based. Many biologists in the early twentieth century turned their backs on the innumerable, often highly speculative phylogenetic trees that sprouted in the front yards of evolutionary morphologists; they turned instead to more experimental branches within the broad realm of biology, such as experimental developmental biology, physiology, and particularly genetics. Our heroes from the previous chapter, Thomas H. Morgan and his nemesis, Richard Goldschmidt, both provide prime examples of that trend. Both started their career, broadly speaking, as comparative anatomists, but both ended up focusing their interests and research efforts on genetics. As historian of biology Peter J. Bowler stated, "Evolutionary morphology will provide much evidence for those historians seeking to argue that scientific knowledge is socially constructed" (1996:73). What lies at the heart of the social construction of the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor is a firm commitment to the Darwinian theory of evolution—that is, the firm commitment to the transformationist, as opposed to emergentist, paradigm that guides the reconstruction of turtle origins.

Such contrasting paradigms, as are the transformationist versus the emergentist perspectives, can also be called contrasting scientific thought styles, i.e., styles of thinking that scientists get used to in the course of their training, or get committed to in the course of their work and interactions with colleagues. Styles of scientific thought were first identified and discussed by Polish Jewish physician and biologist Ludwik Fleck (1896–1961) from Lemberg (now L'viv), later an inmate of the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, in a book manuscript that he submitted for publication in 1933. The book was published in 1935, bearing the title _Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv_ (Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact: Introduction to the Theory of Thought Style and Thought Collective) (for further details, see Wojciech, 2012). The idea here is that a scientific fact does not exist as such, in and of itself. Rather, a scientific fact is to some significant degree embedded in the way a scientist, or a group of scientists, see the world, think about the world, and talk about the world. The style of thought that scientists adopt will influence the way in which they develop theories about the world as they see it. A group of scientists all sharing the same style of scientific thought is prone to reach a consensus with respect to the theories about the world that they develop and accept. Of course, this runs against the common understanding that science is about the "discovery of facts that exist 'in the world' out there." Fleck's position was that the world does not confront us readily "structured into facts," but that the factual structure of the world is, to a significant degree, conditioned by the style of thought adopted by scientists (Hacking, 1999:60). The Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor is an example of such a scientific fact, one that emerged from a certain style of scientific thought as captured by the transformationist paradigm.

The concept of a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor is based on the graphic rendition of a hypothetical (i.e., unobserved) turtle ancestor, where the body contours, or at least the back of the sketched animal, is dotted with black spots. The scattered black dots represent osteoderms, plates of bone ossifying in the dermis layer of the skin and thought to have been present in the turtle ancestor. Through subsequent stages of evolutionary transformation, these ancestral osteoderms would in one way or another coalesce to form the larger plates that would eventually make up the turtle carapace, some of which (the neural and costal plates) would subsequently fuse with the underlying endoskeleton (dorsal vertebral neural arches and ribs). The Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor thus illustrates the theory that the turtle carapace is derived from ancestral osteoderms in a series of graded transformational steps. In the absence of clues gleaned from the fossil record or from the embryonic development of turtles, such a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor must of course be a purely hypothetical construct filling in the gaps that remain in a transformational series of observed fossils. However, and despite early claims to the contrary, Rathke's (1848) observations have stood the test of time. No modern study of turtle development—and there have been a few—has shown osteoderms to first form independently, then to coalesce and eventually to fuse with the underlying dorsal vertebral neural arches and ribs in the formation of a carapace. Given the fact, however, that so many reptiles—both living and fossil—had and have osteoderms embedded in their skin, it seemed reasonable to postulate exactly such a process of fusion of osteoderms first with each other, then with the underlying vertebrae and ribs in order to explain the origin of the turtle carapace in terms of an uninterrupted series of steps of evolutionary transformation. This seems all the more justified in that the Late Triassic turtle _Proganochelys_ , thought to be the oldest known turtle for more than 100 years, developed osteoderms on its limbs, neck, and tail (Gaffney, 1990).

The first to illustrate a putative turtle ancestor with scattered, as yet unfused osteoderms covering the back was Versluys (1914). However, taking into account evidence provided by the investigation of the embryonic development of the carapace, he did not end up postulating a fusion of such osteoderms with underlying vertebrae and ribs. He rather envisioned two diverging lines of turtle evolution. The hypothetical turtle ancestor, he thought, was characterized by an as yet incompletely developed carapace (theca), with a scattering of osteoderms on top of it. The first lineage he stipulated was the one leading to the leatherback sea turtle and its fossil relatives, where the osteoderm covering was completed at the expense of the underlying carapace (theca). The other linage of turtle evolution he thought to have fully developed the carapace (theca) at the expense of an osteoderm covering. Of course, such a reconstruction of the development of the turtle shell collapsed with the recognition that the leatherback and its relatives do not constitute a separate evolutionary lineage leading all the way back to the very origin of turtles but are instead deeply nested within the tree of cryptodire turtles.

The Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor made its second appearance in the scientific literature much later, in a paper published in _Nature_ in 1996. This paper was previously mentioned in chapter 2, as its author, Michael S. Y. Lee, invoked a principle of correlated progression to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtle body plan. The principle is firmly rooted in the transformationist paradigm, as is evident from the accompanying illustration, which was meant to depict the series of intermediate forms that link turtles to Paleozoic stem-reptiles (1996:fig. 1). It was during the course of his graduate student research at Cambridge University that Lee found evidence he thought would link turtles to pareiasaurs, as previously discussed. The reincarnation of the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor was based on two pillars. The first is the result of a cladistic analysis that related turtles to pareiasaurs, the latter known to develop an osteoderm covering in the more advanced members of the group. In fact, pareiasaurs have been said to demonstrate an evolutionary trend, also known as a morphocline, that progresses from large forms covered by few osteoderms that are arranged along the dorsal midline of the body to smaller forms covered by a heavy dermal armor composed of osteoderms (Scheyer and Sander, 2009:fig. 1). The second pillar is the presence of osteoderms on the limbs, neck, and tail in the then oldest fossil turtle known, _Proganochelys_ from the Late Triassic of Germany. In that turtle, osteoderms occur together with a fully formed carapace, and given the fact that in 1996 _Proganochelys_ was still the oldest and most primitive fossil turtle known, it was reasonable to assume that osteoderm formation is a primitive feature of turtles.

The idea, then, to bridge the "famous morphological gap" that separates turtles from Paleozoic (parareptilian) stem-reptiles was to place turtles at the extreme end of the morphocline exhibited by pareiasaurs (Lee, 1993:1716). A morphocline is a theoretical construct, a transformation series, as discussed above, whereby organisms are serially arranged in such a way that a gradual, stepwise, and directed change in anatomy becomes perceptible. Such serial arrangement of inferred or postulated steps of morphological transformation was the hallmark of preevolutionary comparative anatomy pursued in the century predating the publication of Darwin's _Origin_ in 1859. It is easily understood that after the advent of evolutionary thought, such transformation series were reconstructed with increasing fervor but were now interpreted as evidence of successive steps of evolutionary change. There was only one difference in the way such transformation series were interpreted in the times before and after Darwin. Before Darwin, such transformation series were considered to be in principle readable in both directions. After Darwin, such transformation series, now infused with evolutionary meaning, could be read in one direction only, leading from the primitive to the advanced condition of form (Rieppel, 2011). Lee's morphocline, or transformation series, thus sets out from the primitive condition, i.e., some unarmored parareptile. The next link in the chain is a lightly armored pareiasaur, leading on to a more heavily armored pareiasaur, and further on to a dwarf pareiasaur where the osteoderms meet each other in sutures, thus providing a closed dermal armor. The next steps that would lead to turtles would imply the coalescence of the originally small osteoderms to form the larger plates, ultimately those that we know make up the turtle carapace, and then the fusion of some of those plates—the neural and costal plates—with the underlying endoskeletal vertebral neural arches and ribs. The scapula would, according to Lee, come to be positioned inside the rib cage as a consequence of a posterior dislocation of the pectoral girdle, as had been argued by D. M. S. Watson in his _Eunotosaurus_ paper of 1914—a hypothesis that had been rejected by Ruckes in 1929. In this chain of argumentation, the transformationist paradigm focused attention on the gradual, stepwise transformation of adult structures, exemplified in this case by fossils that could be aligned in a progressive transformation series. However, subsequent investigations of the cellular structure of pareiasaur osteoderms revealed "fundamental changes" in the way they ossify compared to elements in the turtle carapace or to osteoderms of other eureptiles (Scheyer and Sander, 2009:1160).

**5.7.** Hypothetical progressive evolution of turtle carapace from ancestral osteoderms.

_Redrawn after Lee, 1996, fig. 1A; drawing by Marlene Donnelly, The Field Museum_.

The next appearance of the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor was in 2009 in the pages of the _Proceedings of the Royal Society of London_. It followed the discovery of fragmentary remains of a thin-shelled turtle from the Late Triassic (Norian) of the Chinle Group of New Mexico. The age of _Chinlechelys_ is thus similar to that of _Proganochelys_ , some 215 million years old, but the elements of the carapace are much thinner. _Chinlechelys_ was identified by its discoverers as "one of the most primitive unambiguous members of the turtle stem lineage" (Joyce et al., 2009:507). One fragment in particular unquestionably identifies these fossil remains as parts of a turtle carapace: a couple of incomplete neural plates associated with two fragmentary vertebrae and a rib that articulates on the boundary between these two vertebrae. _Chinlechelys_ was further characterized by neck spines composed of multiple osteoderms, evidence the authors took to indicate that "the earliest known turtles were covered with rows of dermal armor," i.e., rows of osteoderms (Joyce et al., 2009:507). The ribs of _Chinlechelys_ —broadened in the vertical plane, not in the horizontal plane, which is the way they broaden in turtle embryos—were further found to be only "poorly associated with the overlying costal bones, indicating that these two structures [i.e., the ribs and the costal plates] are independent ossifications in basal turtles," quite unlike the way ribs develop into costal plates in turtle embryos (Joyce et al., 2009:507). All of this, of course, implies that the elements of the carapace form by the coalescence of initially independent osteoderms to form larger plates, some of which subsequently fuse with the underlying endoskeleton (vertebrae and ribs), thus rendering the turtle shell a composite structure. "The composite ('gradual') origin of the turtle shell" was accordingly illustrated in terms of a transformation series that starts out from a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor, a "hypothetical" ancestor, according to the authors (Joyce et al., 2009:511, fig. 4 caption).

The Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor was a theoretical construct, but it gained acceptance in the context of a shared style of scientific thought, one closely aligned with the transformationist paradigm. This hypothetical ancestor was eventually dropped, however, after the discovery of an ancestral turtle in the Late Triassic of China that aligns almost perfectly with what we know about the embryonic development of turtles. Those fossils will be introduced in the next chapter; at this juncture, it suffices to say that the Chinese fossils rendered the derivation of thecal elements in the carapace, such as the neural and costal plates, from ancestral osteoderms obsolete. However, the historical persistence of the composite theory of carapace evolution, which derived neural and costal plates from ancestral osteoderms that first coalesced, then fused to the underlying vertebrae and ribs, remains remarkable, especially in the light of developmental studies that lent no support to a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor. All of the above is not meant to say that the proponents of such a derivation of the turtle shell did not base their interpretation on the careful study of fossils, their bones, and the bone's cellular structure. But it does show the force with which certain paradigmatic perspectives, i.e., certain ways of seeing or ways of thinking, can influence the construction of scientific theory. The scientists who most recently developed the composite theory of carapace evolution were all firmly wedded to a Darwinian worldview, and consequently to the transformationist perspective. The consequence is a gradual, stepwise modification of ancestral structures into descendant ones. Such a process of gradual, stepwise transition from one anatomical structure to a different one would issue the prediction that the ancestral and descendant condition of form should and could be bridged by a series of intermediates. In a perfect world, one with a complete fossil record, it should be possible to reconstruct such transformation series in terms of a sequence of ancestors and descendants. In our less than perfect world, where the fossil record is woefully incomplete, missing transitional forms become hypothetical ancestors, theoretical constructs that satisfy the requirements to complete the whole transformation series that links the ancestral with its ultimate descendant condition of form. In the case of turtles and their derivation from unarmored ancestors, this requirement resulted in the repeated reconstruction of the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor, a theoretical construct that came to represent a hypothetical reality buried in deep time through a process of consensus building among scientists who were collectively researching the evolutionary origin of turtles from a transformationist perspective.

There is no question that Darwinian evolution through variation and natural selection at the level of interbreeding populations does occur, but the question remains whether this is the only possible way of evolutionary transformation. This was one of the major questions asked, and answered in the negative, by early representatives of evolutionary developmental biology such as Stephen Jay Gould and Pere Alberch. There is, they argued, also the possibility of emergent evolution, the creation of new structures not by the transformation of adult ancestral ones but by the reprogramming of embryonic development through a rewiring of its underlying genetic base (Wagner, 2014). Acceptance of the emergentist paradigm and reference to embryonic development might have rendered the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor problematic a long time ago, but possibly at a cost judged to be simply too high by classical Darwinian transformationists—namely, the need to invoke the possibility of a hopeful monster. Sometimes, however, the monstrosity of such a hopeful monster can be significantly reduced by a lucky fossil find, as was the case with an ancestral turtle that emerged from the Late Triassic of southwestern China. And so it is to Chinese fossils that we now turn.

Why Search for Triassic Marine Reptiles in Southern China?

WHAT TODAY IS SOUTHERN CHINA WAS, AT THE CLOSE OF THE PAleozoic some 250 million years ago, a separate, relatively small continent called the Yangtze Plate, or simply the South China Block. It was during the Triassic, the geologic era that succeeded the Paleozoic, that the South China Block started to slowly dock onto the Asian plate, thus becoming part of the supercontinent Pangaea. Two major ocean systems enveloped this supercontinent, which itself, again during the Triassic, started to slowly break up in other parts of the world into what would eventually become the modern continents we know today. The larger of the two ocean systems, forming the eastern coast of Pangaea and in some loose sense the geologic precursor of the Pacific Ocean, is called Panthalassa or the Panthalassic Ocean. The smaller ocean system to the southwest of Pangaea is called the Tethys, which, in its youngest and westernmost part, and again in a loose sense, was the geologic precursor of the Mediterranean Sea.

The majority of Triassic marine reptiles are found in three distinct faunal provinces. One area where these creatures can be found are in outcrops of central and southern Europe, as well as at localities around the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey, the Levant, and Tunisia. This is correspondingly called the Western Tethyan Faunal Province. A second area of occurrence of Triassic marine reptiles is in western North America, with outcrops ranging from British Columbia through Nevada all the way down into northern California, with a smattering of bone fragments coming from the interior of Alaska. This western North American faunal province, bordered by the Panthalassic Ocean, is called the Eastern Pacific Faunal Province. The third distinct geographic region yielding an abundance of Triassic marine reptiles is southwestern China, i.e., the area that once formed part of the South China Block. The marine Triassic deposits of the South China Block attract attention because at that time, the South China Block sat right on the boundary between the eastern Tethyan and the western Pacific Faunal provinces. This, of course, provokes the curiosity of any paleontologist who wants to relate the distribution and evolutionary relationships of Triassic marine organisms to the evolution of the earth's continents. The science that seeks to understand the evolution of the earth's continents from the perspective of the geographic distribution and evolutionary relationships of extinct organisms is called paleobiogeography.

Triassic marine reptiles are of particular interest to the paleobiogeographer for a variety of reasons. First, they are reptiles, and hence they have an anatomy that is much more complex than that of some invertebrate groups, such as the extinct cephalopods known as ammonites. The more complex the anatomy, the more characters can be fed into the analysis of evolutionary relationships. Or, to put it in other words, the phylogenetic relationships of those extinct reptiles can be reconstructed in greater detail, and with a greater degree of confidence, than is possible for many extinct invertebrate groups of organisms. Second, and with the exception of the large ichthyosaurs, Triassic marine reptiles were not creatures that roamed the wide-open sea, as their pelagic descendants such as plesiosaurs and pliosaurs would do during Jurassic and Cretaceous times. During the Triassic, marine reptiles remained largely restricted to nearshore habitats, lagoonal settings like those of the Bahamas today, or epicontinental seas, i.e., shallow warm-water seas that formed across stretches of continents as a consequence of a transient sea-level rise. Such ecological constraints also mean that any particular species of Triassic marine reptiles had a geographically rather restricted distribution, unlike some of the larger ichthyosaurs, which thanks to their pelagic habits had already achieved a cosmopolitan distribution during the Triassic. The rather restricted geographic distribution of any one species of Triassic marine reptiles renders the major evolutionary lineages of Triassic marine reptiles at a global scale more highly diverse. This is because different species evolved in different geographic areas instead of few species spreading out to occupy vast geographic spaces. Putting all of these components together results in a great diversity of locally distributed species of Triassic marine reptiles—ideal conditions to relate the study of their evolutionary relationships to the evolution of the earth's continents (see Rieppel, 1999, for a more technical discussion). The big question with respect to the Triassic marine reptiles from southern China is whether there could be a possibility that some of them would share evolutionary relationships with species from the Eastern Pacific Faunal Province, which is western North America today. If so, how could that be the case, given the fact that these species were not adapted to disperse all the way across the Panthalassic Ocean? To travel all the way along the northern coast of the supercontinent Pangaea would not have worked either, as it would have taken these animals to high latitudes and hence to a cold climate zone that reptiles are not well adapted to tolerate. Evolutionary relationships between Triassic marine reptile species from the South China Block and the Western Tethyan Faunal Province would, in contrast, be far less surprising. At the time, there were small, microcontinental plates of southern origin moving north through the Tethys Ocean. These would eventually attach to the Asian plate, but during the Triassic, these microcontinental plates formed a series of shallow-water tropical stepping-stones stretching from east to west more or less along the equator, providing a connection between the Eastern and Western Tethyan Faunal provinces, which today are represented by southern China on the one side, and European and circum-Mediterranean localities on the other (see the Paleomap Project run by Christopher R. Scotese at <http://www.scotese.com/>, accessed June 21, 2016).

Among the first Triassic marine reptiles reported from southwestern China were sauropterygian remains—some woefully incomplete—found in the late 1950s by employees of the Chinese Geological Survey. They were described by the godfather of Chinese vertebrate paleontology, Chun-Chien Young (1897–1979), from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, the latter administered by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In my pursuit of a global systematic revision of sauropterygians as a prerequisite for later paleobiogeographic analysis, I first visited the IVPP in March 1997 to study these initial finds, kept in the IVPP'S collections. It was also a most welcome opportunity to visit Professor Mee-mann Chang at her home institution. I had previously met her in London and Zurich. Chang is the leading expert on fossil fishes working in China (Normile, 2001:237). As noted on the IVPP website, Chang's career was far from easy and straightforward (<http://english.ivpp.cas.cn/pe/cm/>, accessed June 21, 2016). Born in 1936, the daughter of a noted Nanjing pathologist, Chang turned to the study of rocks and the fossils they contain rather than choosing medicine as a career path. During the period known as the Great Leap Forward, launched in 1958 and aiming at industrialization and an agrarian collectivization under the rule of Mao Zedong's Communist Party, Chang heeded the call for geological research targeting China's natural resources. However, fossil fishes soon captured her interest and passion. So what better thing to do than to embark, in 1965, on graduate student research at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, at the time a leading institution in paleoichthyology. After the catastrophic failure of the Great Leap Forward, Mao reasserted himself in 1966 as the supreme ideological and political leader of China through launching the Cultural Revolution. Upon hearing the news, Chang dropped her research in Sweden and returned to Beijing. Unrest was rapidly rising in Chinese high schools and universities, from which emerged radicalized student groups, the Red Guards, who sought to purge elitist intellectualism at the universities in favor of "purist egalitarianism" (Spence, 1990:607). Confronted by Red Guards, Chang—like so many other young and promising students aiming for a distinguished academic career—was sent to work in the fields of remote rural areas. As the Cultural Revolution wound down, Chang seized the opportunity to resume her graduate student research at the Natural History Museum in Stockholm. Heavily influenced by the Swedish school, she delivered a painstakingly detailed anatomical analysis of a Devonian lobe-finned fish called _Youngolepis_ , named after Professor Chun-Chien Young. Her outstanding work was recognized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who named her an academician, an honor that kick-started her career at the IVPP. She was the first woman to rise to the rank of director of the IVPP, a post she held from 1983 through 1991. Today she holds a joint professorial position at the IVPP and Peking University, is a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a research associate at the AMNH, and she holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago. She is also a foreign member of the Linnean Society of London, an honorary member of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

When Chang and I first met in London, she was engaged in discussions with Colin Patterson and other paleoichthyologists at the British Museum of Natural History, and through those acquaintances, she was exposed to the burgeoning cladistic revolution. It was my own interest and competence in this new method of phylogeny reconstruction that led her to endorse my work, following Colin's recommendation. Upon my arrival in Beijing in 1997, she immediately took me out to lunch. One of the dishes looked unfamiliar to me, so I inquired, "Are these glass noodles?" "No, these are jellyfish, of course, jellyfish!" she exclaimed. She was a wonderful host, inviting me to a party at her house with faculty members of the IVPP, who introduced me to the art of _gan bei_ (drink it all), using expensive imported French wine for this exercise in the Chinese way of toasting. "Drink ex, drink ex," my Chinese colleagues cheered on—what a waste of good-tasting wine! Chang also arranged for me to visit the Geological Museum of China in Beijing. It was the time when the first spectacularly preserved fossil birds known as _Confuciusornis_ had been found in Early Cretaceous lake sediments (some 125 million years old) of Liaoning province, the very locality that would later yield the famous feathered dinosaurs. The director took me to the main meeting room of the museum, where flat wooden boxes much like oversize cigar boxes were arranged on the long table. The boxes were lined with red velvet cloth, each containing a fossil bird. One after another, he picked them up and lifted the lid just long enough for me to glance at the fossil, leaving no time to spot any detail, let alone take any pictures.

It was Mee-mann Chang who opened the door for me to work in China in what would become a truly long-term collaborative engagement with Chinese colleagues. Unlike the newly discovered fossil birds, Triassic marine reptiles already described by C. C. Young were put at my disposal at the IVPP, allowing me to take notes and photographs, and to make drawings. Back in my lab, I started to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of these fragmentary Chinese sauropterygians—and lo and behold! I picked up an admittedly weak signal for trans-Panthalassan (i.e., trans-Pacific) relationships of one of the Chinese sauropterygians with a species that is known from the late Early Triassic of Wyoming, _Corosaurus_ from the reddish Alcova Limestone abundantly exposed near the city of Casper. This is also the easternmost occurrence of any sauropterygian in North America. However, given the incompleteness of both the Chinese fossil and _Corosaurus_ , few characters were available to link the two species, so the signal for possible evolutionary relationships remained weak indeed. The signal was there nonetheless, and it put research on Triassic marine reptiles from southern China on the map for me. But where were the fossils?

The Guanling Biota

Guizhou ranks among the poorest provinces in China. Its remote, mountainous terrain is difficult to navigate; the region is inhabited by a largely peasant ethnic minority population that grows corn and tobacco. In the summer, vast cole-crop (mustard plant) flower fields paint the landscape in a beautiful yellow, attracting throngs of tourists and motivating folkloristic festivals celebrated by the Miao people. During my first field season there in September 2000, I was horrified by the huge blue trucks that hauled coal out of the mountains along narrow, winding roads. A large barrel would be mounted on the top of the truck's cabin, dripping lukewarm water on the hot brakes. Small wonder we came across many accidents! A driver who had wrecked his truck by hitting the pillar of a bridge lay on the roadside wrapped in white sheets. He would soon be carried to his last resting place in his home village in a colorful ceremony with cymbals, pipes, and fireworks, accompanied by a live pig, destined to become the centerpiece for the ensuing banquet, along with a couple of chickens perhaps. People in Guizhou bury their loved ones on the hillsides of the karst mountains, choosing the site such that the headstone faces a beautiful vista. As the rush for fossils gathered steam, whole mountainsides were turned over and tunneled by farmers in search of sea lilies (crinoids), reptiles, good luck, and fortune. In those remote mountain villages, a house with a new roof signifies a farmer who successfully sold a large reptile skeleton. A family of six in Xinpu township, a major fossil excavation site near the town of Guanling, was estimated to earn around 10,000 yuan per year, but a well-preserved reptile fossil "can sell for tens of thousands of yuan," said Liting Wang, Guizhou's state geologist (<http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012-03/28/content_14930069.htm>, accessed June 21, 2016). Yet with all their eagerness to uncover fossilized riches, in every instance, the fossil hunters leave the scattered tombs intact, with the headstones eerily sticking out like solitary monuments from the float of discarded shards of rock.

The gold rush for Triassic marine reptiles in southwestern China set in suddenly and unexpectedly in the late 1990s. Invertebrate fossils from the Triassic black shales in the area of Guanling county in Guizhou province had been reported in the scientific literature as early as the 1940s, but it wasn't until the late 1990s that the floodgates opened for a plethora of marine reptiles to come to light. The Guizhou government had started to invest heavily in economic development. Freeways were built connecting the capital of Guizhou province, Guiyang, with cities like Xingyi through new superhighways across breathtaking bridges. Housing projects sprang up to accommodate a growing trend toward urbanization. The amount of public debt rose in tandem with the demand for concrete. As limestone quarrying intensified, incredible riches of fossils came to light. Mee-mann Chang arranged for me to become part of a team of IVPP researchers who would focus on the study of these newly discovered Triassic marine reptiles. The graduate students, faculty, and staff whom I accompanied on the September 2000 field trip, funded by the National Geographic Society, all stayed in modest government housing in Guanling, the town located closest to the newly discovered fossil digging sites. The town was dirty and messy, and hot water was hard to come by. Guanling was indeed designated a national poverty county by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 2008, although it now boasts a new five-star hotel (<http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012-03/28/content_14930069.htm>, accessed June 21, 2016). Major nearby tourist attractions include the famous Huangguoshu waterfall, the Huangjiang big gorge (also known as the crack of the earth), and a newly established geopark (Wang et al., 2009). A couple of times during our many sojourns in town, we visited an old Communist Party training center sitting behind a tall, rusty fence, where the Guizhou government kept confiscated Triassic marine reptiles under lock and key in a dusty, poorly lit room—not the best conditions to get a good look at them. Where did these fossils come from? Who had collected them, and why had the government confiscated them?

The owner of the confiscated fossil reptiles that were kept on the Communist Party premises in Guanling had lost a small fortune through the government's actions. He was rumored to be a successful Chineseborn businessman now resident in the United States. He had bought the fossils from friends, with the declared purpose to build a private institute for paleontological research and development. It was suspected that development here would mean fossils on display in a museum exhibit accessible through the front door while fossils were traded through the backdoor. Before the government seized his collection, however, the amateur collector and fossil dealer had his fossils photographed, described, named, and published by Chinese paleontologists in a Chinese geological journal. Their owner perhaps hoped the importance—and with it the commercial value—of his fossils would increase as a consequence of their formal published description. He fought the confiscation of his collection in court, but the ruling was that the fossils belonged to the Guanling Buyei-Miao autonomous county, from which soil they had been dug up. The dismal descriptions of new genera and species of these Triassic marine reptiles were published in a Chinese journal of geology and geochemistry. The quality of the published photographs is extremely poor, allowing no identification of any detail beyond the general contours of the fossils. The genus and species names were properly introduced, however, so as to satisfy the international code of zoological nomenclature. Although the species diagnoses remained vacuous, the locality data of these commercially acquired fossils necessarily vague, and the photographs useless, all the elements were in place to render those genus and species names scientifically valid names. That way, this publication (Yin et al., 2000) became the first published report on the diversity of fossil reptiles from the Guanling area, of early Late Triassic (Carnian) age, some 235 million years old. Given their history, many of the specimens in the confiscated collection became holotypes—that is, paradigmatic exemplars of their species—which to the present day remain inaccessible to proper scientific investigation, description, and illustration. This, of course, represents a major stumbling block in the systematic treatment of all those fossil reptiles, which, together with associated invertebrates such as the beautifully preserved sea lilies (crinoids), constitute the famous Guanling biota.

Anybody wishing to publish the name of a new species is required, according to the international code of nomenclature, to not only provide a diagnosis that details how the species differs from all others in its genus, an indication of the locality where the new species was found, and an illustration of a representative specimen of the new species, but also to designate a holotype. For any properly described species, the holotype serves as the ultimate standard of comparison. In a loose sense, the holotype is for a species what the birth certificate is for a person. Anybody wanting to introduce a new species must make sure that the relevant specimens do indeed represent a new species different from all others in its genus that have previously been described. This must ultimately be ascertained through a detailed comparison with the holotypes of the congeneric species previously described. With the holotypes covered in dust in a dimly lit government building, this is impossible. Until the government of Guanling county decides to release the confiscated fossils to a public museum, the systematic treatment of the Guanling fauna continues to face problems. The good news, however, is that the government of Guanling county has stepped up its efforts to curb the at times excessive illegal private collecting and trafficking in fossils—to protect not only its natural heritage but also the landscape itself, and sometimes even the collectors. Extensive quarries created by fossil collectors threatened to ruin the view of a landscape composed of beautiful karst mountains. Collectors would dig uncontrolled tunnels into the fossiliferous layers of sedimentary rock, which can turn into death traps when they collapse. One family we visited had turned to the practice of removing the topsoil from the underlying rock after the corn had been harvested in the fall. Fossil digging continued throughout winter until spring, when the topsoil was spread out and corn was planted again. A Guanling Fossil Group geopark was established in 2003, upgraded the following year to the Guanling Fossil Group National GeoPark. The whole enterprise turned into a 30 million yuan project with the goal not just to protect the fossil sites but also to educate the local population and to attract tourism to this impoverished part of Guizhou province (<http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012–03/28/content_14930069.htm>, accessed June 21, 2016). Today, a museum displays the rich diversity of fossil reptiles as well as the beautiful crinoids so characteristic of the Guanling biota. An IMAX theater brings the fossils to life in color movies, and signs along an extensive boardwalk trail explain the local geology. An expert visiting the geopark might be a little surprised or disappointed, however, by some of the specimens on exhibit, because some have visibly been doctored. The falsification of fossils is indeed epidemic in China, and increasingly difficult to recognize as the skill level of the farmers who sell these fossils improves.

There are two ways to collect Triassic marine reptiles in southwestern China. The scientifically best controlled, but also most tedious and likewise quite expensive, way is to hire local farmers for a dig, to compensate the village of these farmers for the loss of fertile terrain and crop, and to excavate the fossils with a proper permit and with expert scientific supervision. To fulfill all these requirements requires a lot of communication with local officials, mostly conducted over traditional Chinese banquets with their strictly regulated seating orders and hierarchically structured toasting sequences: _gan bei_ , often with _maotei_ , an expensive local liquor that ordinary people drink on Chinese New Year—if they can afford it. The benefits of excavating fossils following scientific standards, however, are many. Most importantly, the geographic and geologic (stratigraphic) provenience of the fossils is exactly known, and if prepared under scientific supervision, they will not have been tampered with. The downside of fossil excavation is that the employed farmers learn to recognize which layers in the sequence of rocks yield fossils—a knowledge that they may later use to their own advantage.

This brings us to the second method of collecting Triassic marine reptiles in southern China, which is to arrange ways to essentially buy them from farmers in some officially sanctioned way. One way to do so was dubbed by my colleagues as going fishing. The idea is to take a box lunch to some remote village, park the flashy suv in a central spot, then sit around while eating. The women will have spent hours in the fields by that time of the day, some of them already returning to the village with huge loads of tobacco leaves on their backs; the men, however, will slowly emerge from their dwellings, and after some meandering, they might invite the strangers to come to their houses to see the fossils they have for sale. It is in these poorly lit and dusty conditions that forged fossils become difficult to be identified as such. Forging a fossil here means to embellish specimens through the addition of parts taken from other, less completely preserved and hence less attractive skeletons. I remember having once been invited to describe what looked like a perfect skeleton of a nothosaur-like fossil. As I looked at the limbs, or also at the tail, something seemed to be amiss. Yet there were the typical irregular quartzite veins running through the skeleton, which attested to its genuineness. I asked for a needle and started to scratch. Sure enough, the quartzite veins had been painted on the doctored specimen and could easily be removed.

Composite specimens are nothing unusual in vertebrate paleontology, however. Many mounted dinosaurs on display in museums worldwide are replicas of composite specimens. Consider the case of the famous Howe Ranch in Big Horn County, Wyoming, where the AMNH's Barnum Brown (1873–1963) and his team collected around 4,000 dinosaur bones during a six-month campaign in 1934, an effort continued many years later by Swiss dinosaur hunter Hans-Jakob "Kirby" Siber (born 1942) (Bird, 1985; <http://www.sauriermuseum.ch/cms/upload/Press/Download/DL-english/The_Dinosaur_Museum.pdf>, accessed June 21, 2016). The dinosaurs collected in the Howe Quarry were land-dwelling animals. Their fossilized remains come from carcasses washed down the river all the way into a delta system. Because of the decay of the associated soft parts like muscles and tendons, the skeletons would fall apart in the process. During transport downstream, the individual bones of a skeleton would disarticulate. As these disarticulated elements were washed into the delta system, the smaller, lighter bones would travel farther than the larger, heavier ones. This is how the famous dinosaur graveyard developed in Howe Quarry, a jumble of disarticulated dinosaur bones sorted according to size, not according to the species they represent. The task of the paleontologist is thus to decipher this puzzle, step by step, to learn through extensive comparisons which bones represent the same species and hence go together, and to slowly put together the skeleton by assembling its parts. As one of my colleagues once remarked, there is no unidentifiable bone; there is only lack of anatomic knowledge (and this is probably too optimistic a statement). Any such skeleton is thus most likely composed of bones that came from several individual animals of similar size of the same species, and hence may represent a composite specimen.

But things with the Triassic marine reptiles in southern China are quite a bit different. Dead animals were not transported down river systems but rather sank to the seafloor, where the carcasses became embedded in fine-grained sediment. The seafloor sediment remained unperturbed through wave action because it was deposited at a depth below the storm wave base—that is to say, even if a heavy storm whipped up huge waves, these did not reach deep enough into the water column to whirl up the sediment covering the seafloor and the carcasses it contains. Lack of turbulence at such depth usually also results in a paucity, or even lack, of oxygen, which explains the scarcity or absence of scavengers. The carcasses of dead marine reptiles consequently remained undisturbed either by wave action or scavengers while the slow process of decay and subsequent fossilization proceeded. The result is a far lesser degree of disarticulation of the bones than is usual; the best and most beautiful specimens are thus represented by complete and articulated skeletons. But nature is never perfect; nor are the skills of the farmers who excavate these fossils. The temptation is thus great to embellish an incompletely preserved or damaged specimen to make it look more complete, as it then might fetch a higher price. Yielding to this temptation, farmers—who, of course, are not expert paleontologists—often mix up bones that come from skeletons of different species. The result is a chimera, which, if it remains unrecognized, adds to the embarrassment of the scientist who might describe it. Needless to say, there is much debate and discussion in the scientific literature about the genuineness of key Chinese fossils—not just from the Triassic of southern and southwestern provinces but from all over the country.

Today Guanling county is not the only area known to harbor Triassic marine reptiles in its soil. In Guizhou province alone, Xingyi and Panxian counties mark areas where Triassic marine reptiles are found—the Panxian biota of early Middle Triassic age, the Xingyi biota of late Middle Triassic age, with the two faunas ranging from 235 to 240 million years before the present. Another hot spot, similar to the Panxian biota, is found in Luoping county in Yunnan province, while another locality near Chaohu in Anhui province yields scientifically highly important new marine reptiles of late Lower Triassic age, some 248 million years old. These are just the most important sites that receive the greatest scientific, official, and public attention today. Farmers digging up fossils, fixing them up, and selling them have corrupted Chinese paleontology for decades. The illegal export of Chinese vertebrate fossils through Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Japan for sale abroad has further degraded paleontological resources in China (Liston, 2014:701). The director of the IVPP in Beijing, Zhou Zhonghe, speaks of "'illegal and unscientific collecting and commercial trading' that has flooded the market with fake fossils and caused an 'irretrievable loss' of crucial information" (Balter, 2013:1153). Li Chun from the IVPP, who is surely among the most successful fossil hunters in the Triassic of southwestern China today and who started his career as a graduate student participant in the September 2000 field trip mentioned above, estimates that "more than 80% of marine reptile specimens now on display in Chinese museums have been 'altered or artificially combined to various degrees'" (Stone, 2010a:1740). He is one of the most active campaigners against fraudulent fossils and illegal fossil trade, and has urged improved legislation: "I don't object to efforts to overhaul fossil protection," he says, "but any regulation should embody respect for research freedom" (Yu, 2009:925). He is likewise concerned about the potentially devastating environmental impact of fossil collecting, as seen, for example, at Wolonggang Mountain near Guanling (Wang et al., 2009). In a recent popular book, he wrote, "I have to say sorry to the mountains here, not because we take out their treasures, but because of the destruction of the landscape. A scar was left in the field." Eventually, after some bumps along the long and winding road of federal legislation, new laws were passed in China in 2010, which took effect in 2011, which declare all fossils to be state property and which place the authority of issuing excavation permits into the hands of the Ministry of Land Resources. Applications for excavation permits are to be reviewed by a national panel of paleontologists—the only caveat that remains being the fact that the Ministry of Land Resources will also be the sole arbiter to decide where high-priority fossils will be deposited, either in national or regional universities or museums. (A detailed account of current Chinese legislation on fossil excavation and export is provided by Liston and You, 2015.) This raises the potential problem that because of institutional policies and rivalries, accessibility of certain fossils might become limited for scientists (Stone, 2010b:1453). Again, the world is rarely perfect, and much remains to be done. "We will see" is Zhou Zhonghe's cautious verdict on the new legislation, as the motivation of fossil dealers to stay in business should not be underestimated (Stone, 2010b:1453). But progress is being made. The quarry in Xingyi county, Guizhou province, is now a protected area—an open-air museum, so to speak—where the local government set up a fossil preparation facility right next to the excavation site. This facility not only guarantees the genuineness of the fossils on display but also keeps one or several fossil preparators on the site for surveillance and protection. Geological parks are projected elsewhere, complete with plans for the construction of museums, with the hope that they will attract not only local schoolchildren but also tourism from further afield.

Companions of the Ancestral Turtle

The diversity of Triassic marine reptiles from southwestern China is unique. The only other place that comes close in terms of richness of Triassic marine reptiles is the Monte San Giorgio in southern Switzerland (canton of Ticino) and an adjacent locality just across the border in Italy, where a similarly favorable depositional environment—technically known as a Lagerstätte—prevailed during the Middle Triassic: a partially closed marine basin with fine sediment building up in a more or less oxygen-free environment at its bottom, below the storm wave base (Furrer, 2004). At both localities, southwestern China and Monte San Giorgio, the richness of the fossil record can be expressed both in numbers of fossils and numbers of different species. A great variety of species is represented by a large number of often exquisitely preserved fossils. The species of the two localities are often closely related to one another, which is not surprising because of faunal exchange between the Eastern and Western Tethyan faunal provinces at that time. However, the evolutionary relationships of Chinese Triassic marine reptiles extend not only to those known from Monte San Giorgio but also to those from the western Tethys in general.

Some of the lineages of Triassic marine reptiles, mainly sauropterygians, were introduced in chapter 1. Of these, placodonts—both unarmored and armored—occurred on either side of the Tethys Ocean. Skeletons representing the genus _Placodus_ from both Europe and southern China are hardly distinguishable from one another, indicating very close relationships. Of the several species of armored placodonts known from China, one, a cyamodontoid placodont called _Psephochelys_ , exhibits a curious mixture of characteristics otherwise known from two different species of European armored placodonts, _Psephoderma_ from the Upper Triassic of northern Italy and _Placochelys_ from the Upper Triassic of Hungary, the latter the putative turtle ancestor described by Otto Jaekel. Other sauropterygians include pachypleurosaurs, of which several species are known from China. The best known is _Keichousaurus_ , a small, lizardlike creature less than a foot long, known from literally thousands of specimens. They include everything from sexually dimorphic males and females (including gravid females) to a good number of embryos (Cheng, Wu, and Ji, 2004). One is tempted to consider a shallow-water deposit near Xingyi in Guizhou province as having been a communal breeding ground for _Keichousaurus_ , where females gathered to give birth to live offspring. Hundreds of _Keichousaurus_ specimens have been illegally exported and put up for sale along with fake fossils, to be purchased by museums and private collectors all over the world. Pachypleurosaurs are a fairly diverse lot in both the Eastern and Western Tethyan faunal provinces. Their evolutionary relationships indicate that they may have spread from east to west, entering the German Muschelkalk sea through a doorway located in Upper Silesia, then spreading south from the Germanic into what today is the Alpine Triassic through a gateway located in Burgundy. It remains unknown whether this is just pachypleurosaur history or whether this pattern of east-to-west dispersal is also characteristic of other lineages of Triassic marine reptiles. The reason is the current lack of well-supported and well-resolved patterns of phylogenetic relationships. This is not a consequence of a lack of fossils, though. Nothosaurs are again well represented among the Triassic marine reptiles from southern China, as are pistosaurs, the latter close to the ancestry of the plesiosaurs that roamed the Jurassic seas. But as is often the case when new fossils come to light, the new species thus recognized often show character combinations that spoil the old classification of sauropterygian diversity, which was based mainly on European forms. What to do when a fossil comes to light that has not been tampered with, yet sports a nothosaurlike skull on a pistosaur-like neck? A lot of work will be required to incorporate the richness of the sauropterygian fossil record from southern China into an amended global sauropterygian family tree.

Sauropterygians are, of course, not the only lineage of Triassic marine reptiles found in southwestern China. Ichthyosaurs are abundant as well. One quarry near the city of Chaohu in Anhui province, with deposits of late Lower Triassic age, some 248 million years old, yields _Chaohusaurus_ , an early and primitive ichthyopterygian that promises to shed new light on the origin of these dolphinlike reptiles. An even more important discovery from the quarry near Chaohu is a small, ichthyosaur-like creature with a short snout, edentulous jaws, and large, flipperlike forelimbs with a very poorly ossified wrist. This species, called _Cartorhynchus lenticarpus_ , seems to lie even closer to the origin of ichthyopterygians; it might have been able to move across land in a seal-like manner (Motani et al., 2014).

Another enigmatic and little-known clade of Triassic marine reptiles is the thalattosaurs. Although they are relatively rare in European deposits, they are more abundant in western North America, but they reached their greatest numbers and diversity in southwestern China. The thalattosaur genera that stand out are _Anshunsaurus_ , found at a locality in the Anshun prefecture near the famous Huangguoshu waterfall some 40 kilometers from Guanling, and _Xinpusaurus_ , a genus based on one of the specimens seized by the Guizhou government. Both genera comprise two species, and in each of these genera, one of the two species is distinctly larger than the other. This illustrates a familiar pattern of habitat partitioning, as the larger species will favor different prey than the smaller, congeneric species. Instead of competing with each other, these congeneric species thus evolved to partition the food resources between themselves.

Southwestern China was also a hotbed for protorosaur evolution and diversification. Protorosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles that persisted from the Late Paleozoic through the Triassic. They comprise terrestrial, arboreal, and aquatic species, both freshwater and marine; their fossils are found in Europe, Africa, North America, Asia (Russia, India, China), Australia, and even Antarctica. _Prolacerta_ is a species known from Antarctica and South Africa, which at one time had been thought to be ancestral to modern lizards, as its name betrays ( _Lacerta_ is Latin for lizard). Whereas protorosaurs have, in fact, nothing to do with the origin of scaly reptiles (i.e., squamates, which include lizards and snakes), their position within reptiles as a whole, as well as the interrelationships among them, continue to be a matter of debate. It is even doubtful that all the species that are currently included among protorosaurs do indeed form a natural group, i.e., an evolutionary lineage of unique origin. Some of the protorosaurs found in Triassic marine deposits are characterized by a grotesquely elongated neck, the function of which remains difficult to explain. A moderate neck elongation is seen in _Macrocnemus_ , a genus known from Monte San Giorgio and southwestern China that reached about 3 feet (just under 1 meter) in total length. The name of _Macrocnemus_ refers to its long tibia, implicitly to its long hind limbs, which are much longer than the forelimbs. _Macrocnemus_ may have been a predominantly terrestrial organism, which in rapid locomotion may have resorted to bipedal running, as is also seen in modern lizards with similar disparate limb proportions. In contrast to _Macrocnemus_ , the neck vertebrae are extremely narrow and spectacularly elongated in the closely related genus _Tanystropheus_ , an animal with a fully marine lifestyle that grew to up to 20 feet (6 meters) in length. The first remains of _Tanystropheus_ to become known were isolated neck vertebrae from the Middle Triassic of the Germanic Muschelkalk. Given their strange proportions, as well as the fact that they are hollow, as are the bones in pterosaurs, Franz Baron Nopcsa, the eccentric paleontologist from the University of Vienna, first interpreted these isolated vertebrae as phalanges in the much-elongated fourth finger of a pterosaur called _Tribelesodon_. The forth digit in the forelimb is the one that in pterosaurs supports the leading edge of the wing membrane (patagium). It was not until articulated skeletons of _Tanystropheus_ came to light through excavations at Monte San Giorgio that the true nature of these strange elements was recognized. Today, several specimens of _Tanystropheus_ are known from the southern Alps and southwestern China, again closely resembling each other and hence closely related. The neck of _Tanystropheus_ comprises a total of 13 vertebrae, as opposed to the 12 dorsal vertebrae that make up the trunk. However, the neck of _Tanystropheus_ as a whole is nearly three times as long as the trunk. In addition, the cervical ribs are much elongated and aligned along the cervical vertebral column, straddling several intervertebral joints and thus forming strong bundles of bony rods on either side of the neck. This must have contributed to a certain stiffness of the neck, rendering the functional explanation of neck elongation in _Tanystropheus_ even more difficult.

A similarly extreme elongation of the neck is observed in _Dinocephalosaurus_ , a bizarre protorosaur exclusively known from the early Middle Triassic of Panxian county, Guizhou province. Only one specimen is currently known in which the entire skeleton, from tip of snout to tip of tail, is preserved. The specimen measures a total of 5.1 meters (just over 16 feet) in length, of which 16 centimeters are attributable to the skull, 214 centimeters to the neck, 100 centimeters to the trunk, and 160 centimeters to the tail. The first specimen found and described, i.e., the holotype, consists of a complete, three-dimensionally preserved skull and a few associated neck vertebrae. Because it was of impressive size, with jaws furnished with a robust dentition including prominent maxillary fangs, the species was called _Dinocephalosaurus orientalis_ by Li Chun, which means "saurian with a terrible head from Asia." Once complete skeletons became known, however, the skull lost some of its frightening appearance, as it is relatively small compared to the whole animal. Neck elongation in _Dinocephalosaurus_ must have evolved independently, i.e., in convergence to _Tanystropheus_ , because the neck in _Dinocephalosaurus_ comprises a total of 33 vertebrae, with the latter not hollow, more robustly built, and individually somewhat less elongated than those in _Tanystropheus_. This might have allowed for a greater flexibility of the neck, but again, and as in _Tanystropheus_ , the cervical ribs are much elongated, straddling up to six intervertebral joints, thus forming strong bundles of bony rods on either side of the neck, presumably contributing to its stiffness.

It is hard to speculate what the function of these extremely elongated necks—two and a half up to nearly three times as long as the trunk—might have been. That there was some adaptive advantage to be had from such neck elongation may be indicated by the fact that it evolved independently twice, in _Tanystropheus_ and in _Dinocephalosaurus_. One hypothesis is that the long neck facilitated feeding under water, i.e., feeding in a dense medium, which poses special problems. Think of grabbing a bar of soap floating in water. As you try to quickly close your hand around the slippery soap, the very closing of the hand creates a jet stream that carries the soap away. The same thing happens when an underwater predator closes its mouth to grab a food item. The closing of the mouth causes water to be expelled from the buccal cavity, creating a jet stream that carries the potential prey away. To avoid that effect, many modern animals that feed under water, like bony fishes, salamanders, and aquatic turtles, pursue a strategy of suction feeding. Aquatic salamanders and turtles increase the volume of the buccal cavity by a depression of the floor of the mouth and of the throat by means of the throat skeleton and its associated musculature. As the jaws open, water is rapidly sucked into the buccal cavity and into the expanded throat region, carrying the targeted prey with it. Once the jaws have clamped down on the prey, the excess water can be expelled. If, in _Tanystropheus_ and _Dinocephalosaurus_ , the cervical ribs splayed outward as the jaws opened, then a large volume would have been created for the esophagus to expand in the neck region. This would have provoked vigorous suction, pulling the targeted prey into the reach of the jaws (Li, Rieppel, and LaBarbera, 2004).

Even more enigmatic than the thalattosaurs or _Dinocephalosaurus_ are the saurosphargids. It is really only the newly discovered Chinese material that began to shed some light on fossils belonging to that group. The name _Saurosphargis_ first appeared in Frech (1903) as a nomen nudum (naked name), so called because the publication of this name was accompanied neither by a diagnosis nor by an illustration of the fossil it referred to; nor was a holotype explicitly designated. The fossil designated by that name was a fragment of a trunk skeleton kept at the University of Breslau, now Wroclaw, in Poland. It came from deposits of the lowermost Middle Triassic, possibly uppermost Lower Triassic near Gogolin (now Gorny Slask) in Upper Silesia. After Hitler's designation of Breslau as a fortress to be defended at all costs early in 1945, the city became the locale of a siege by the advancing Red Army that lasted for three months. In the course of the battle, most of the museum collection, the unique specimen of _Saurosphargis_ included, was destroyed. A good photograph of the specimen was published, however, by F. von Huene in 1936, along with a description, which made it possible to identify complete skeletons from southern China as belonging to the same genus—or at any rate to be closely related to _Saurosphargis_.

The Chinese specimens from the lower Middle Triassic of Panxian county in Guizhou province are complete skeletons including the skull, and they thus refute the earlier hypothesis that _Saurosphargis_ might be a primitive placodont, because it lacked the characteristic crushing tooth plates. However, the precise relationships of saurosphargids remain a matter of ongoing research. Most interesting is a highly derived member of the saurosphargids discovered by Li Chun from the IVPP, _Sinosaurosphargis_ from the lower Middle Triassic Luoping locality in Yunnan province, which is of the same age and in close geographic proximity to the Panxian fauna of Guizhou province (Li et al., 2011). _Sinosaurosphargis_ has a skull with a narrow, anteriorly rounded snout and a wide temporal region, which is deeply embayed from below, suggesting the loss of the lower temporal arch. In contrast to _Saurosphargis, Sinosaurosphargis_ has no upper temporal fenestra, which appears to have been secondarily closed, a hypothesis that has to be entertained for turtles as well. More interesting still is the trunk skeleton, which is strikingly turtlelike (Hirasawa, Nagashima, and Kuratani, 2013). The shape of the body is broad, flattened, and almost disklike. The ribs of the trunk extend from the vertebral column straight outward in an almost horizontal plane, rather than forming a true rib cage as in other, more generalized tetrapods. This being a fossil, one is left to wonder which developmental mechanisms rendered the growth of ribs turtlelike in _Sinosaurosphargis_. Moreover, the ribs are horizontally broadened, forming flat, bladelike structures that contact their neighbors all along their length. While reminiscent of the dorsal ribs in turtles, which eventually form the costal plates of the carapace, the dorsal ribs in _Sinosaurosphargis_ only loosely contact each other along their length, without forming any true sutures. The rigid disklike structure formed by the ribs of the trunk in _Sinosaurosphargis_ is, in addition, completely covered by a closed layer of osteoderms that meet each other in weakly interdigitating sutures. _Sinosaurosphargis_ thus comes across as an almost perfect representation of the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor—if there ever had been one. The rib orientation and consequent body shape are already turtlelike. The ribs are broadened so as to contact each other along their length. Some commentators ascertained "that the rib cage of _Sinosaurosphargis_ exclusively functioned as a shell," as does the carapace in turtles (Hirasawa, Nagashima, and Kuratani, 2013:5). Further, the whole dorsal side of the trunk is covered by osteoderms. All that would apparently be needed to transform _Sinosaurosphargis_ into a turtle would be the fusion of osteoderms into the larger plates characteristic of the carapace and then the subsequent fusion of some of these plates (neurals and costals) with the underlying endoskeleton (dorsal vertebral neural arches and ribs). Although the study of the embryonic development of the turtle carapace sketched in the previous chapter refutes the idea of a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor, _Sinosaurosphargis_ did also not come out as ancestral to turtles in an analysis of its evolutionary relationships. It was a different species from the marine Triassic deposits of southwestern China that was recognized as an ancestral turtle. This most spectacular find to date by Li Chun firmly removes _Sinosaurosphargis_ from any consideration as a possible turtle ancestor, thus laying the theory of a Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor to its final rest.

An Ancestral Turtle on the Half Shell

Li Chun reminisced how one day in 2007, when pursuing fieldwork on the Half Shell in Guizhou near Guanling, his car broke down (<http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2012–03/28/content_14930069.htm>, accessed June 21, 2016). He took the vehicle to a garage, where the owner, after inquiring about Li's whereabouts, showed him a strange fish fossil that originated from the area. Li felt his blood pulsating as he recognized in the fish fossil the same species he had already seen and acquired fossils of in Beijing: a turtle in the making. _Odontochelys semitestacea_ comes from early Carnian, i.e., early Upper Triassic marine deposits near Guanling in Guizhou province, and is thus the oldest undisputed turtle currently known—some 220 million years old (Li et al., 2008; but see discussion in chapter 2 on the Permian _Eunotosaurus_ and the late Middle Triassic [Ladinian] _Pappochelys_ as putative stem-turtles). It is also the most primitive one. The distinction of being the oldest and most primitive turtle had previously gone to _Proganochelys_ from the middle Upper Triassic (Norian) of Germany. But _Proganochelys_ is, in fact, already a finished turtle, complete with carapace and plastron about 3.3 feet (1 meter) long. The upper and lower jaws of _Proganochelys_ had already lost the dentition and, as in modern turtles, were covered by a keratinous beak called rhamphotheca. The primitiveness accorded to _Proganochelys_ is based on details of skull structure, including the presence of denticles on the bony roof of the mouth, the dermal palate. Such are absent in all other turtles, both fossil and extant, as also is the palatobasal articulation, which joins the dermal palate to the floor of the braincase in _Proganochelys. Odontochelys_ , by comparison, tells a quite different story.

**6.6.** Holotype and paratype of _Odontochelys semitestacea_ from early Late Triassic Guanling biota, Guizhou province, southwestern China. Holotype ( _left_ ) shows broadened ribs; paratype ( _right_ ) shows fully developed plastron.

This ancestral turtle is a relatively small animal, 40 to 50 centimeters (15 to 19 inches) in length from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail. The skull is not truncated anteriorly, as it is in _Proganochelys_ and modern turtles, but instead extends into a pointed snout. The upper and lower jaws are furnished with small, pointed, peglike teeth, and denticles are also strewn across the dermal palate. As in all diapsid reptiles, the tympanic membrane was suspended from the quadrate bone at the back end of the skull. But whereas in modern turtles the quadrate bone forms a funnel-shaped structure across which the tympanum is stretched, it is a simple, posteriorly concave structure in _Odontochelys_ , a primitive feature also shared by _Proganochelys_. The vertebral count for _Odontochelys_ is eight cervicals in the neck, nine dorsals in the trunk, two sacrals, and minimally 20 caudals, which for turtles translates into a long tail, another primitive feature. Whereas the pectoral girdle in _Odontochelys_ , and especially the shoulder blade (scapula), again retains a primitive morphology relative to modern turtles, the pelvic girdle shares distinct specializations that are also characteristic of _Proganochelys_ and modern turtles. The limb skeleton of _Odontochelys_ is robust, with four—instead of three, as in modern turtles—phalanges in the third and fourth digit of hands and feet, another primitive feature of _Odontochelys_. The fusion of two bones in the ankle (astragalus and calcaneum) indicates that the specimens were near adulthood, if not fully adult.

The most interesting aspect of _Odontochelys_ is the trunk skeleton, however. Osteoderms are altogether absent. The plastron, or ventral shield, is fully developed in _Odontochelys_ , even specialized in that it incorporates two instead of only one pair of mesoplastral plates. The hyoplastral, mesoplastral, and hypoplastral plates furthermore expand into distinct and pointed lateral projections, which results in curiously frilled lateral margins of the plastron. But whereas the plastron is fully ossified, the carapace failed to do so. A carapacial disk must have been developed in _Odontochelys_ , as its dorsal ribs resemble those of a modern-day turtle embryo, except for their mode of articulation on the dorsal vertebrae. In tetrapods generally, the dorsal ribs articulate on the vertebral centrum and its neural arch. Such is not the case in _Proganochelys_ and modern turtles, where the dorsal ribs instead articulate right on the boundary between two successive trunk vertebrae. This results in an alternate arrangement of the neural and costal plates, which develop from the dorsal neural arches and ribs, respectively. Such an alternate arrangement of neural and costal plates increases the robustness of the carapace. In contrast, _Odontochelys_ retains the primitive condition, with its dorsal ribs articulating on short and stubby transverse processes projecting from the vertebral centrum. However, as in modern-day turtle embryos, the dorsal ribs extend laterally in _Odontochelys_ , their growth redirected by the carapacial ridge, which must have been developed in the area between the fore- and hind limbs. The fact that all the ribs are projecting laterally, rather than being arranged in a flabellate (fan-shaped) manner, as in modern turtles, with the anteriormost one trending anterolaterally and the posteriormost one trending posterolaterally, indicates that the carapacial ridge in _Odontochelys_ may have been incompletely differentiated along the anterior and posterior margin of the carapacial disk (Nagashima et al., 2009). As a result, the shoulder blade (scapula) is located in front of, rather than below, the anteriormost dorsal rib. The dorsal ribs themselves are bladelike and broadened in a horizontal plane through the development of incremental bone along their anterior and posterior edges. However, as at a certain early developmental stage of a modern turtle, the ribs, although broadened, still remain separated from one another by a distinct intercostal space, which in _Odontochelys_ persists into adulthood. The dorsal vertebral neural arches are capped by squarish neural plates, but whether a nuchal plate (the first one to ossify in the carapace of modern turtles) was present or not in _Odontochelys_ unfortunately remains unknown. None of the other bony elements known to occur in the carapace of modern turtles was formed in _Odontochelys;_ a lateral bridge was likewise not developed. _Odontochelys_ is thus a truly transitional form, one that is on the way to becoming a turtle but has not quite arrived yet. Outwardly, _Odontochelys_ must have looked like a turtle, but the neck, head, and limbs could not be brought under the carapace, which was a soft structure constituted by a thickening of the skin and supported by broadened ribs.

**6.7.** Life reconstruction of _Odontochelys semitestacea_.

Although _Odontochelys_ was found in marine sediments, the size and the anatomy of its limbs render it unlikely that it roamed the open sea, as modern sea turtles equipped with large flippers do. But its limb proportions do indicate that it was an aquatic turtle, comparable to those modern freshwater turtles that inhabit stagnant or small bodies of water (Joyce and Gauthier, 2003). It is conceivable, therefore, that _Odontochelys_ lived along the margins of the marine basin in a lagoonal setting, the corpses having drifted out into open waters after death to fossilize in the sediments in which we find them today. Indeed, the occurrence of fossilized driftwood and other plant remains in the same sediments indicates a relative proximity of coastal waters. Aquatic habits of _Odontochelys_ would also explain why the plastron, in contrast to the carapace, was fully developed and ossified. It would have protected the turtle from predators attacking a swimming organism from below, while at the same time it provided "bone ballast" to help counteract positive buoyancy caused by air-filled lungs (Taylor, 2000:16). Beyond such function, bone ballast can even allow for an adaptive increase in the size and hence lung volume. As one expert put it, "An increase in lung volume is potentially highly adaptive for animals that are slow swimmers, that feed on stationary or slowly moving food, and that live in shallow waters" (Taylor, 2000:16). This description of the kind of animal that would profit from enlarged lungs at the cost of having to carry bone ballast seems to capture _Odontochelys_ nicely. Neutral buoyancy achieved through bone ballast, combined with a larger supply of oxygen, would certainly suit a slow-moving predator foraging in shallow water. Add to that the insight that bone ballast such as the plastron in _Odontochelys_ , in addition to offering protection and countering buoyancy, would also fulfill a host of additional physiological functions, as does the shell in modern turtles (Jackson, 2011).

It has been noted already that secondarily marine reptiles often show a reduced degree of ossification in parts of their skeleton, perhaps an effect of the reduced gravitational pull in the aquatic environment. For example, elements in the wrist and ankle may be weakly ossified, or they may fail to ossify altogether. The question has thus come up whether _Odontochelys_ does indeed represent a primitive condition with respect to the ossification, or rather lack thereof, of the carapace. Could it not also be possible that _Odontochelys_ has secondarily reduced the carapace, as is also the case in the leatherback sea turtle ( _Dermochelys_ ), although an osteoderm covering is still retained in the latter species? (Reisz and Head, 2008). That such is unlikely, however, is indicated by many other primitive features seen in _Odontochelys_ , in particular the articulation of the dorsal ribs on short transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae. A complete carapace was developed in _Proganochelys_ , where the dorsal ribs have already shifted their articulation to the boundary between two successive dorsal vertebrae. The same shift of the articulation of the dorsal ribs would be expected to be present in _Odontochelys_ if a fully developed and ossified carapace had ancestrally been present.

Outlook

_Odontochelys_ provides a striking example of a primitive turtle, and as such, it revived an age-old controversy. William Harvey (1578–1657) not only earned an everlasting place in the pantheon of the history of medicine for his discovery of blood circulation but was also interested in the embryonic development of the chicken. In the published report of his observations that appeared in 1651, Harvey compared the early chicken embryo, spread out on the surface of the yolk, to a maggot. The implicit idea here is that the higher animal, the chicken, recapitulates during its embryonic development a condition of form that is characteristic of a lower animal, the maggot. Naturalist-philosopher Charles Bonnet of eighteenth-century Geneva expressed the same idea when he found the playful behavior of a toddler to be more similar to the behavior of adult higher primates than to that of elder brothers and sisters. Darwin is known to have compared the behavior of his small daughters to that of the orangutans kept in Regent's Park Zoo in London. But it was left to Swiss-born comparative anatomist and paleontologist Louis Agassiz (1807–1873), the founder of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, to fully work out the famous proposal of a threefold parallelism. What Agassiz set out to prove was that the same sequence of transformational steps are expressed, in parallel, in the ascending classification of organisms, in embryonic development, and in the fossil record. One famous example he could draw on had been worked out by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire at the Paris National Natural History Museum, who had studied the anatomy and embryology of fossil and living crocodiles. In primitive crocodiles, which appear early in the fossil record, the internal nares, or choanae, are located in an anterior position in the bony roof of the mouth; in advanced crocodiles, appearing later in the fossil record, the internal nares are displaced to a position at the far back end of the dermal palate. The position of the internal nares is thus an important character for the classification of crocodiles. It so happens that during the embryonic development of modern crocodiles, the gradual shift of the internal nares from an anterior to a posterior position can be observed, in correlation with the closing of the bony roof of the mouth (dermal palate) in an anteroposterior progression. Correspondingly, the earliest crocodiles that show up in the Triassic period show a relatively anterior position of the internal nares, in contrast to the Jurassic and Cretaceous crocodiles, in which the posterior shift of the internal nares is successively completed. A parallelism thus obtains between classification, embryonic development, and the sequence of appearance of fossils through geologic time.

Agassiz was an opponent of Darwin's theory of evolution, in contrast to Ernst Haeckel from the University of Jena, who through his work earned the reputation of being the German Darwin (Hoβfeld, 2007:454). It was Haeckel who, in a simplifying way, captured this parallelism in his famous biogenetic law. To disambiguate the term "evolution," which had previously been used to refer to embryonic development, Haeckel introduced the term "ontogeny" to refer to individual development. The term "phylogeny" he introduced to refer to Darwinian evolution, i.e., descent with modification. His slogan, the biogenetic law, then said that "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny." Although a crass oversimplification, it captured the imagination of many of Haeckel's followers as much as it generated discussion and attracted criticism. There is no need to delve into the intricacies of the voluminous literature surrounding this issue. But even a cautious and hesitant acceptance of some of Agassiz's and Haeckel's ideas would point to the fact that information gleaned from embryonic development can prove important for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. With respect to the evolution of the carapace, for example, the oldest undisputed fossil turtle currently known, _Odontochelys_ , is not only the most primitive one in many respects but also shows striking parallels to embryonic stages of modern-day turtles. Although a passionate critic of Haeckel, Swiss comparative anatomist and phylogenetic systematist Adolf Naef (1883–1949) even went a step further. He again urged caution and acknowledged exceptions to the rule that the study of embryonic development can meaningfully inform the reconstruction of the tree of life. Yet given the ostensible success of comparative embryological investigations in deciphering evolutionary pathways, he went so far as to stipulate that the study of embryos could indeed result in predictions as to which kind of intermediary fossils might still be discovered in the future (Rieppel, Williams, and Ebach, 2013). In the case of turtles, Rathke's study (1848) on turtle development, as well as subsequent studies in turtle embryology and carapace development, should already have long ago rendered the Polka Dot Turtle Ancestor obsolete and focused expectations on some ancestral condition that is now beautifully exemplified by _Odontochelys_.

But whereas _Odontochelys_ did shed new light on the evolution of the turtle shell, nicely complementing ongoing developmental studies, it did not reveal the evolutionary origin of turtles. Although primitive in many respects relative to _Proganochelys_ and modern turtles, the mere presence of primitive features does not also reveal ancestry. But then, and in the light of the cladistic revolution, to ask for ancestors may not be the right thing to do anyway. The mystery of mysteries that still awaits its solution concerns the sister group relationships of turtles among reptiles, diapsids in particular. Such sister group relationships are generally revealed through shared evolutionary innovations. It is thus not the many primitive characteristics of _Odontochelys_ that promise to reveal the sister group relationships of turtles, because many other reptile groups may share the same primitive features—teeth on the upper and lower jaws, for example. What would be required for the resolution of the sister group relationships of turtles would be for _Odontochelys_ to share some evolutionary innovation with some other reptile group outside turtles. In that respect, _Odontochelys_ remains silent. Those evolutionary innovations that it does have are the same that characterize later, as well as modern, turtles. The ankle of _Odontochelys_ , for example, shows the same anatomical and functional specializations also seen in modern turtles—specializations that furthermore are also present in lepidosauromorphs, i.e., in the tuatara and scaly reptiles (lizards and snakes). _Odontochelys_ thus leaves us with the same alternatives of turtle relationships as had been recognized before, discussed in chapter 2. Comparative anatomy points strongly, but not exclusively, in the direction of a lepidosauromorph relationship of turtles. Molecular (DNA) data point overwhelmingly, but again not exclusively, in the direction of relationships of turtles with archosauromophs, a group that comprises crocodiles, dinosaurs, and birds, among others. After the recognition of the Permian _Eunotosaurus_ and the Ladinian _Pappochelys_ —both identified as diapsids—as putative stem-turtles, the number of paleontologists still linking turtles to Paleozoic parareptiles will probably shrink rapidly (Bever et al., 2015, and references therein; Schoch and Sues, 2015). In 2013, the 10th International Congress of Morphology was held in Barcelona, Spain, featuring a special symposium on turtle development and evolution. One science writer sketched the symposium as one where biologists told "dueling stories of how the turtles get their shells" (Lubick, 2013:329). Watching the battle over turtle origins and evolution rage among developmental biologists, molecular systematists, and paleontologists, her conclusions were, "So far, the groups have agreed to disagree" (Lubick, 2014:37).

OLIVIER RIEPPEL is Rowe Family Curator of Evolutionary Biology at The Field Museum in Chicago. His current research focuses on Triassic marine reptiles from southern China. He has also contributed extensively to the comparative anatomy and evolution of modern reptiles, most notably the evolutionary origin of turtles, and snakes. He publishes widely in the history and philosophy of comparative biology on topics as diverse as species concepts, mid-eighteenth-century French biology, and the history of phylogenetic systematics. Rieppel is on the editorial board of several peer-reviewed scientific journals and has himself published more than 350 scientific papers and eight books.
