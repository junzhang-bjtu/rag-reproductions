# _Introduction_

This book has been written as a gradual maneuver in self-defense. Let me explain.

You see, I have lived fairly quietly in New York for more than a decade, but in the last few years I have increasingly found myself approached at parties and P.T.A. meetings by a fresh breed of enthusiastic Americans who note my sari and ask, "You wouldn't know of a restaurant where we could get some good Indian food, would you?" My answer is always an apologetic, "I am afraid there is no place in New York or anywhere in America where top-quality Indian food can be found—except, of course, in private Indian homes." At this, their faces fall and I begin to feel a familiar upsurge of guilt and patriotic responsibility. I try to explain about the Indian restaurants. It isn't as if there aren't any. But these establishments invariably underestimate both the curiosity and the palate of contemporary Americans. Instead of specializing in food from a particular state or district, they serve a generalized Indian food from no specific area whatsoever; a restaurant may call itself "Kashmir" but will serve no Kashmiri food; at another calling itself "Punjab," you will be unable to get those delicious Punjabi mainstays, corn bread and mustard greens. There are several reasons for this. One is timidity—the fear that diners' unfamiliarity with regional specialties will make certain dishes unpopular. Another is the caliber of the cooks: most are former seamen who left their ships with the hope of making a living, somehow or other, in America, and as cooking seemed to require no unusual skills, a great many became restaurateurs, copying the standardized menus of other Indian restaurants and refusing to experiment with dishes from their own villages which they perhaps knew much better. The result of all this is that the sauces in such eating places inevitably have the same color, taste, and consistency; the dishes generally come "mild, medium, or hot," which is an indication that the food is not being cooked _with_ the spices, as it should be, but that something is being ladled on; appetizers are suggested not because Indians eat them, but because it is felt that Americans cannot do without them.

Naturally, it is difficult to recommend such a restaurant. The only alternative is to invite the people in question home for dinner. I did this for several years, justifying the expense and the effort by telling myself that _someone_ had to let Americans know what authentic Indian food was like and that I couldn't heartlessly ignore their curiosity and interest.

So I kept feeding people in large numbers until exhaustion finally put an end to what I considered was rather discreet proselytizing. A better scheme, as effective as it was cheap, occurred to me. I began writing down the recipes of my most popular dishes and made several copies of them. Whenever someone started a conversation about Indian food, I just handed out a recipe. It worked so well that once when we attended a party, we found that every single dish had been made from my recipes. The hostess, a new acquaintance, was totally unaware of this. In fact, when somebody praised the food and asked her what cookbook she had used, she replied, "Well, my dear, these recipes seem to be just floating around. I got them from Edith and she got them from a gal at work." I smiled and said nothing. I was so grateful that Americans were showing such an interest in authentic Indian food and that it wasn't I who was doing the shopping, paying the bills, cooking, and washing up.

I soon found myself mailing recipes to friends in North Brookfield, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; Madison, Wisconsin. I heard from a family in Boston who had loved the marinated butterflied leg of lamb—and this family included two little children who had been, until then, extremely dubious about all foreign foods.

As the number of Americans cooking from my recipes was getting larger, this cookbook was, slowly and inevitably, taking shape. Now that it is done, my sense of relief is overpowering. For all those people who say they love my food, well, here it is: Indian recipes completely adapted to the American kitchen, some easy and simple, others to be mastered with patience and practice.

I realize that many of you may be cooking Indian food for the first time. I have tried to write the recipes in great detail, describing how the food should look at the end of each major step as well as when it is fully cooked. This may make the recipes a bit long, but don't let that put you off. My intention is merely to lessen the chances for error. Also, don't be discouraged by a long list of spices. Once you have them on your shelf, it is just as easy to sprinkle in five of them as it is to add two.

It may, perhaps, encourage you to know that I myself learned to cook not from observation and practice in our family's kitchen in Delhi but from recipes written on flimsy air-letters, mailed to me by my mother. As a teen-ager growing up in India I was preoccupied with the usual teen-age concerns—boys (whom we saw only at a distance and therefore coveted), my ambitions (why can't _I_ play Hamlet?), and other such nonsense. I went into the kitchen only as a dilettante, more to taste than to help or learn.

It was when I was twenty and went to England as a student that I started to learn how to cook. I was extremely homesick, and this homesickness took the form of a longing for Indian food.

The canteen at my drama school served a see-through slice of roast beef accompanied by some watery potatoes and cabbage which no amount of H & B sauce could improve. My limited scholarship funds did not allow me to eat out at the Indian restaurants. So I decided to learn how to cook, and I wrote to my mother in India for recipes. She would answer with long letters in Hindi which I would take with me to school. As I ate my roast and two vegetables, I would ponder her advice... put in a pinch of asafetida—don't let it burn—now put in the cumin and stir for a second or two... add the chopped-up tomatoes and fry... my mouth would water and the cabbage would stick in my throat. At this point I couldn't even make tea.

But with expert long-distance help from my mother, I started learning. I began adapting her recipes to what was available in England and later, when I moved to America, to the ingredients and appliances that I found here. Over the years I discovered that the electric blender could do much of what the Indian grinding stone did, and much faster; that instead of roasting eggplant in hot ashes as my mother recommended, I could do it directly over a gas burner; that American meats just couldn't be fried the Indian way because they contained too much water and that it was often better to cook with canned tomatoes than fresh ones because they had more taste and color. Slowly I began changing the recipes to suit the conditions. I managed to arrive at the genuine taste of traditional dishes, but often had to take quite a circuitous and unorthodox route to get there.

I'm sure by now you want to know what special ingredients are required to produce that genuine flavor, what special spices you need before you embark on this culinary adventure. Let me start negatively by saying that what you don't need is curry powder, which many of you may already realize. But for those who don't, let me explain.

To me the word "curry" is as degrading to India's great cuisine as the term "chop suey" was to China's. But just as Americans have learned, in the last few years, to distinguish between the different styles of Chinese cooking and between the different dishes, I fervently hope that they will soon do the same with Indian food instead of lumping it all under the dubious catchall title of "curry." "Curry" is just a vague, inaccurate word which the world has picked up from the British, who, in turn, got it mistakenly from us. It seems to mean different things to different people. Sometimes it is used synonymously with all Indian food. In America it can mean either Indian food or curry powder. To add to this confusion, Indians writing or speaking in English use the word themselves to distinguish dishes with a sauce, i.e., stewlike dishes. Of course when Indians speak in their own languages, they never use the word at all, instead identifying each dish by its own name.

The origin of this English word could be _kari_ , a Tamil word meaning "sauce," it could be a spice called the _kari_ leaf, or it could be _karhi_ , a North Indian dish made with buttermilk and chickpea flour. Who knows where some wandering sixteenth-century Englishman found his inspiration! Whatever its source, the word is obviously a British oversimplification for what is universally recognized as a richly varied cuisine.

If "curry" is an oversimplified name for an ancient cuisine, then "curry powder" attempts to oversimplify (and destroy) the cuisine itself. Curry powders are standard blends of several spices, including cumin, coriander, fenugreek, red peppers, and tumeric—standard blends which Indians themselves never use. Here again I am sure the British are responsible for its creation. This is how I imagine it happened:

_A British officer in full uniform (possibly a young David Niven) is standing under a palm tree and looking fondly at his bungalow as Indian servants go back and forth carrying heavy trunks from the house into a waiting carriage. When the carriage is loaded, the servants line up on the veranda with tears in their eyes. The officer himself, overcome with emotion, turns to khansamah (cook)_.

OFFICER: | How I shall miss your delicious cooking. My good man, why don't you mix me a box of those wonderful spices that you have been using. I will carry it back with me to Surrey, and there, whenever I feel nostalgic about India, I will take out this box and sprinkle some of your aromatic spice mixture into my bubbling pot.  
---|---  
KHANSAMAH: | Yes, sa'ab, as you say, sa'ab. _(Runs off to kitchen.)_

_Scene shifts to kitchen, where cook is seen hastily throwing spices into box. He runs back with it to officer_.

KHANSAMAH: | Here is the box, sa'ab. Sa'ab, if your friend also like, for a sum of two rupees each, I can make more boxes for them as well....  
---|---

_Several years later: Former cook is now successful exporter. He is seen filling boxes marked "Best Curry Powder." When boxes are filled, he puts them in a large crate and stamps it in black: FOR EXPORT ONLY. Then he goes to his money box, opens it, takes out his money, and gleefully counts it. As scene fades away, former cook and present exporter is doing Dance of Joy_....

So much for my scenario. The point is that no Indian ever uses curry powder in his cooking. Nor do we mix our own, because if we did we would end up with our own blend of collective spices. Cooking again and again with the same blend of spices would make all dishes taste alike. It would be the same as taking a tablespoon each of dried thyme, basil, rosemary, tarragon, bay leaves, and allspice, putting them in a jar, shaking the jar, labeling it "French Spices," and then using a portion of this mixture for every French dish one made, from soup to salad. Also, since "curry powder" is a blend of _ground_ spices, it tends to get stale very quickly and lose its flavor. So one ends up with something that has the negative aspects of being standardized and somewhat rancid at the same time.

And it isn't just Britishers and Americans who are misguided. The Chinese, who insist on the freshest herbs and vegetables for all their own food, use some of the stalest curry powder for the curried dumplings they serve in Hong Kong's best tea rooms. The Japanese, who are probably the world's greatest culinary aesthetes, don't hesitate to serve a greenish-yellow glutinous mess over their rice and label it "curry," and the Frenchman, who insists on a perfect _velouté_ , also eats the most ghastly "shrimp Indienne" in a curry-tinted cream sauce.

But eating habits are changing, and today Americans especially seem to have a great desire to experience the "real" thing, an authentic taste, a different life style. Anything fake is deplored, fake foods included. It is a hopeful trend and leads me to believe that if Indian food is ever going to come into its own in America, this is perhaps the time for it.

What is it then that gives Indian food its particular range of flavors? It may surprise you to know that a great many of the spices we use are ones that you probably have on your kitchen shelves already—cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, black pepper, nutmeg, and mace. These, along with cardamom, are what we call _garam masalas_ , "hot spices." They are hot only inasmuch as they are supposed to provide heat for the body. The spices which you may not have would include cumin, coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, black mustard seeds, fennel, and dried hot peppers. All these, I find, are readily available on the spice racks of most big-city supermarkets—all you have to do is to look in the correct alphabetical pigeonhole. Those that are not available can be sent for. At the end of this book I will list retail stores and mail-order houses that specialize in Indian ingredients.

There is a slight problem with supermarket spices which you might as well be aware of. Those spices which do not "move"—i.e., sell fast—tend to stay on the shelves and get stale. A few lose their aroma, others fade in the light, some get oily and rancid. Therefore, try to buy only whole spices and grind them yourself in small quantities. The grinding can be done in a coffee grinder, or, if the spices are slightly roasted first, some can be crushed between waxed paper with a rolling pin. The electric blender will grind spices, if you do them in sufficiently large quantities. If all else fails, you could use a mortar and pestle, though that tends to crush spices rather than grind them. Whole spices retain their flavors for very long periods. Make sure you store them in jars with tightly screwed lids, well away from dampness and sunlight. Ground cumin and coriander are fine if bought from Indian spice dealers in small quantities.

Even though the Indian styles of cooking require, in general, a fair number of spices, we do not, of course, use all of them for each dish we cook. Cauliflower, for example, may be cooked with just turmeric, fresh ginger, fresh Chinese parsley, and ground cumin. A chicken dish I make requires only whole cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, and cardamom pods. One potato dish needs just a pinch of asafetida, whole cumin seeds, and turmeric.

Sometimes, as you glance at a couple of recipes, the spices used might look identical, which may lead you to the conclusion that the two dishes will taste the same. But that's not necessarily true. It is not only _what_ spices you use but also _how_ you use them that gives dishes their special taste and appearance. Take cumin, for instance. If it is roasted whole and crushed, its coffee color will darken the looks of any food and its strong aroma will fill not just your kitchen but your entire house. This way it has a sharp, nutty taste. Whole cumin, when it is "popped" in very hot fat, has a mild aroma and a gentle, licoricelike taste. Ground unroasted cumin provides a third flavor and has perhaps the mildest taste of the three.

Different spices require different treatment during cooking. Turmeric burns easily and becomes bitter, so it is generally used in conjunction with some liquid. Saffron gives off its best color when lightly roasted, crushed, and then left to soak in warm milk. Too many fenugreek seeds can make a dish bitter, so while you can play around with the number of peppercorns or cardamom pods you put into a dish, you cannot do the same with fenugreek.

Spices, herbs, and other seasonings are always added to the cooking pot in a specific order, and this again changes the taste of the dish. For example, if a hot dried red pepper is browned in oil and then mixed in with cooked lentils, the lentils will not be very hot but will have gained the subtle flavor of the pepper. On the other hand, if the pepper is browned in oil first and then cooked _with_ the lentils, you will end up with a fairly hot dish. This applies to nearly all the spices, as each has its own peculiarities. The order in which they are put into a pot is extremely important. All this may sound confusing, but it is really easier to master than, say, a French custard. If you follow the recipes carefully, you will soon begin to understand the properties and idiosyncrasies of each spice.

Not all Indian dishes are stewlike, as some people imagine. We distinguish between "wet" and "dry" dishes, and of course we have every category in between. Sometimes we start cooking a meat dish like a stew, then boil down the liquid and end up by frying the meat. At other times we fry a fresh ginger paste with turmeric, sauté a vegetable in this mixture briefly, sprinkle a little water over it, and let it cook, covered, in its own steam. Potatoes can be cooked in a variety of sauces, or they can be boiled, diced, and cooked "dry" with a little oil, fennel, and cumin seed. We deep-fry vegetables in batter and eat them with a fresh green coriander chutney, and we roast chicken and fish whole in clay ovens. Just as there is no one spice used for every single Indian dish, there is really no single technique that is common to all Indian foods.

A great many people stay away from Indian food because they assume it is hot. This "heat," when it exists, is generally provided by the red or green pepper (or chili), spices which can easily be omitted without any loss of authenticity. In fact, in my own family, we rarely ate hot food, because it didn't "agree" with my father. Being perverse, I naturally developed a very strong liking for it, but there is no reason why you must do the same. Some Americans feel that they lose face if they are confronted with very hot food and then cannot eat it. Perhaps they will relax when they know that there are also many Indians who prefer their food "mild." It is not the chili pepper which makes Indian food Indian. After all, the Thais, Mexicans, Nigerians, and many others use it as well. It is the preparation and combination of whole or freshly ground spices which makes Indian foods unique.

There is another slight misconception even among knowledgeable Americans, which is that most Indian food is cooked in _ghee_ , and that _ghee_ is clarified butter. Actually, there are two kinds _of ghee_. The _usli ghee_ , or "real ghee," is indeed clarified butter, but if you consider India as a whole, it is very rarely used. In a nation where milk and butter are luxuries, cooking in _usli ghee_ for the masses is unthinkable. Most people keep a small jar of _ousli ghee_ in their kitchen and use it occasionally on _chapatis_ or _dal_ , for cooking special dishes, or for religious and medicinal purposes. (I remember when at the age of twelve I had my ears pierced, for a month my mother applied hot fomentations of _usli ghee_ and turmeric to my tortured earlobes!) In the western state of Punjab, however, _usli ghee_ , butter, buttermilk, and milk are used much more frequently. The Punjabis, a tall, strong people, tend to believe that their enterprising spirit and immense energy come from the meat, corn bread, mustard greens, and dairy products they consume, and in some households it is quite common to give each child a daily spoonful of _usli ghee_ pretty much in the same way that American parents pop vitamin pills into their children's mouths.

The other _ghee_ , the one that is more commonly used, is made up of various vegetable oils and is what is called vegetable shortening in America. It is sold under various brand names—Dalda and Rath being the most popular—and can be purchased in large cans. In my own family we always used this vegetable _ghee_ because my father insisted that _usli ghee_ was too rich for a daily diet.

The cooking medium that is used almost as frequently as vegetable _ghee_ is oil. It is cheap and excellent for deep frying. Also, different states show their individuality by using local oils—coconut oil in Kerala, mustard oil in Bengal, and peanut or sesame oil in various parts of North India.

In the last few years India, like most other nations, has become increasingly aware of the possible harm that can be caused by saturated fats. Both Dalda and Rath are said to contain saturated oils and are therefore being rejected in favor of peanut oil, mustard oil, and other unsaturated oil mixtures. For this reason, I have used vegetable oil as the cooking medium in most of my recipes. You can use peanut oil or any other unsaturated oil mixture that you prefer. If, however, you wish to use _usli ghee_ , directions for making it can be found on this page.

Newborn Indian infants do not, of course, start off life on spicy foods (I have been asked this question several times). They thrive on mother's milk, like most other infants. I do remember one particular custom in our family, however. As soon as an infant was born, whether at home or in the hospital, my grandmother would come and write the sacred syllable "OM" (I am) on its tongue, with a finger dipped in honey. Children develop the taste and desire for spicy foods rather slowly. Our standard excuse, as six-year-olds, when we didn't want to eat was that the cook had put some red pepper in our food by mistake. If my mother was the only one presiding at the table, we would generally get away with it, but sometimes my father would arrive and insist on tasting the food and then our ruse was discovered. At the age of six, I loved to put sugar on my bread, but by nine I had graduated to a thick layer of hot mango pickle.

Children in America are always being told not to eat too much candy. We were always being told not to eat too many sour things like tamarinds, raw mangoes, and _aam papar (aam papar_ is made with sour mangoes, and the tastiest variety looks like thick, dirty brown leather). Even though our garden was full of fruit trees, the only ones that bore fruit were the mulberry and mango trees. We weren't interested in the mulberries because they were sweet; we left those to the old folks. But the raw mangoes were attacked and seldom given a chance to ripen. The best time to steal the mangoes was midafternoon when the temperature was 110 degrees and most of the household napped in air-cooled comfort. Often we would climb the mango tree equipped with knife, salt, and pepper. We would then picnic on the boughs, along with the twittering sparrows.

My father and mother were both born in the heart of the old city of Delhi, where the streets are so narrow that a man and a cow can barely pass each other. Most of the old town houses there are three or four floors high and are built around an inner courtyard. They have many small rooms, niches for closets, and no view, except other houses, other courtyards, other floors. On all the floors are balconies, running around the courtyard. When my paternal grandfather had become a successful barrister and had returned from his travels abroad, being an adventurous and ambitious man, he decided to move out of the area and bought himself a garden estate on the banks of the Jumna. But my mother's people stayed on in the old city. Every now and then my mother would take us to visit her family. Here I must rather shamefacedly admit that I felt, in those days, that I had very little in common with my old-city cousins. I loved to go there because of the food, which was superb—the best Kayasth (the name of my community) food one could ever hope to have. There were not many servants in this house, and all the cooking was done by the women, squatting on the kitchen floor. The odors would draw me to the kitchen door, where I would stand, first on one foot, then another, watching and sniffing. I wanted to go inside, but the kitchen was tiny and I would have had to take my shoes off—which was always difficult because of my mother's tight, well-knotted shoe-lacing techniques. So I would stand, peering from the outside, until my aunt, a gentle woman with large teeth, would tell me to go play on the roof. I would do as she said, but eventually the odor of mushrooms cooking would draw me down again.

Sunset signaled the approach of dinner. A large cotton rug was unfolded in the courtyard. On this was spread a clean cotton sheet. Food was brought in on serving plates and placed in the center of the sheet. I always liked to carry in my favorite dishes, so I could look at them longer. Everyone sat around the food. Unfortunately, the men ate first and the women served them. I would watch my favorite dish of mushrooms, which I _loved_ , being devoured by greedy males. As I took the empty plate to refil it for them, I would pray that at least _some_ would be left for us. Finally our turn came. Fresh food was put on the serving plates and the women and girls would eat. We ate directly from the serving plate, breaking off a piece of bread from one plate and dipping it into another. My favorite mushrooms were obtainable only briefly during the rainy season. They were cooked with onions, garlic, tomatoes, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and a lot of hot red pepper. We ate them with _pooris_ , an unleavened whole-wheat bread, round and puffed with hot air. We would also have potatoes, boiled first and then cooked with coriander, cumin, fenugreek, turmeric, onions, garlic, ginger, and yogurt. There would be lamb, prepared in the best Moghul tradition—with saffron, cardamoms, and nutmeg. And there were always pickles called water pickles because the pickling base is not oil or vinegar but water. To make them, green marrows (small summer squash), turnips, carrots, or watermelon rinds are blanched or put raw into a large earthenware container, together with crushed mustard seeds, salt, and, of course, water. The container is lightly covered, and the pickle is allowed to mature for one to two weeks. Even the liquid is totally irresistible.

Childhood taste habits never completely die out. They seem to leave their mark on us and often dictate the areas that we are willing to explore or not explore as adults. That is why I feel, rather strongly, that children should be exposed to not only the best foods but also foods of as many different countries as possible. Culinary insularity is really nothing more than a set of stubborn taste habits. And the best way to break these habits is through enlightened exposure at an early age. You'd be surprised at what some children are willing to try if adults are not sitting there looking apprehensive. I've had my daughters' American friends drop by and eat, with great relish, all sorts of Indian foods, including betel nuts! I keep my brass betel box in the living room. By now I am quite accustomed to seeing my daughters' friends come through the front door, say hello, walk straight to the betel box, rifle it, scattering seeds all over the floor, and then calmly walk on to the children's room, munching away like any Indian child. They seem to love the cauliflower cooked with fresh ginger and the chicken cooked with whole spices, and the marinated butterflied leg of lamb is, of course, an all-time favorite. One group of girls astonished me by eating (and enjoying) some hot mango pickle! All these children are under twelve years of age and belong to the same pizza-Coke sorority that we have long despaired of.

I have tried to begin each chapter with the simpler recipes—those which are easier to make and not too surprising to the palate.

At the end of each recipe I give serving suggestions in which I sometimes indicate if the dish is one which is likely to find popularity with children. Don't underestimate them. They'll surprise you. I remember so well one of our trips to Paris. We were seated in a restaurant slightly beyond our means, studying our menus, when my husband asked the children what appetizer they wanted. The eldest, who was supposed to be studying French, didn't want to admit that she couldn't understand a word of the menu, so she countered with, "Well, what are _you_ having?" My husband translated that section of the menu and said he was having snails and would they like to try that. Two children immediately turned up their noses and said, "Eeeu," a favorite word in school that year. The third, whose glasses always seem to rest halfway down her nose, peered over them at my husband and asked, "Do you _like_ snails?" My husband said he liked them very much. She looked up at the ceiling for a good minute as if consulting someone in that direction and then said, "Okay, I'll try 'em." Well, she loved them and now orders snails at every opportunity she gets.

Try out these Indian dishes on your whole family. Take some of them with you on picnics. You'll be amazed to see how fast they are eaten up.

There is another group of people for whom this book should prove very useful. And they are vegetarians. One of the hardest things to find in this country is a good, balanced, fresh vegetarian meal. The choice seems to lie between macaroni and cheese, salads, raw or boiled vegetables, cheeses and fruit. The reason is that the American menu is planned around meat, poultry, or fish, the vegetables being either just accessories or, as in the case of the slice of tomato and leaf of lettuce served with hamburgers, mere adornments. This country has not developed a vegetarian cuisine because, until now, there seemed to be no need for it. But a lot of young Americans are turning to vegetarianism because of a horror of all forms of killing, and a lot of older Americans are turning to it out of despair—they are wary of beef, pork, and lamb because of cholesterol, wary offish because of mercury pollution, veal is ridiculously expensive, and just how many days a week can you eat chicken?

I happen to feel that Indian vegetarian food is perhaps the best in the world. It almost has to be. Our vegetarian population goes into the hundred millions! The Brahmins, upper-caste Hindus from both North and South India, rarely touch meat, fish, or eggs. The Buddhists and Jains abhor all killing, orthodox Jains going so far as to wear masks over their noses and mouths so as not to accidentally entrap some minute victim that strays in as they inhale. The poor in India are also generally vegetarian because meat is simply beyond their means.

The result of all this is that in the last few thousand years, Indians have developed a most balanced and varied vegetarian cuisine. The essential proteins in these meals are provided by the many _dals_ (lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, etc.) and by yogurt relishes and milk desserts. The variety is provided by the sheer number of vegetable dishes. Each is cooked with a different combination of spices—some with sauces, others "dry," some vegetables cooked in combination with others, like potatoes, peas, and cauliflower, others grated and stuffed in bread, some boiled, some sautéed, some fried, some pickled, and some puréed into fresh chutneys.

The longest chapter in this book is the one on vegetables. That, as well as the chapters on Rice; Breads; Chutneys, Pickles, and Other Relishes; and Desserts should provide enough material for vegetarians to make interesting and wholesome menus.

I also give, a little later, a list of sample menus both vegetarian and nonvegetarian. Use them if you feel you need initial guidance, but experiment and try any combination that strikes your fancy. Also, don't feel compelled to plunge into Indian cooking with a full-scale banquet. An Indian soup with your meal one day, a tomato chutney with your roast lamb the next, some sweet rice with your duck on the weekend—these are good beginnings. If you are in the habit of serving spaghetti and meat sauce quite often, try rice and _kheema_ instead. It is a pleasant variation and equally simple.

All the dishes in this book can be made in standard American pots, pans, and skillets. It does help, however, to use good-quality heavy-bottomed pots, especially for rice. For making Indian bread a _tava_ , or rounded griddle, is very convenient, but you can use instead a cast-iron skillet. For deep frying we use a _karhai_ , which is similar to a Chinese wok. Many specialty kitchenware stores carry woks. If you can find one easily, do buy it. It is a worthwhile investment. If you cannot find one, don't be discouraged, as I will suggest substitutes whenever a _karhai_ (or wok) is called for.

A word about the limitations of this book. If you are looking for an encyclopedic tome encompassing _all_ Indian food, you certainly won't find it here. Such a task would have taken me at least twenty years, as I would have had to approach it slowly, region by region. What this book does offer you is the chance to understand and cook the food of one specific area—the region in and around Delhi, including the adjacent sections of Uttar Pradesh.

Since Delhi is a city, pretty much like Washington, D.C., you might consider knowing the food of this area alone as being rather limited. But that is not so. First of all, the best Indian food is that which is specifically regional. I would rather that you started with a thorough understanding of the cuisine and eating habits of one region than with a vague superficial understanding of the cuisines of the entire subcontinent. Second, even though Delhi is just one city, it is the capital and was, until the British threw them out in the nineteenth century, the seat of the great Moghul emperors. And it was in their royal kitchens that the Delhi cuisine was conceived. Because of the Moghuls' power and prestige, their cuisine was then aped, with interesting local variations, in the courts of the lesser maharajahs, rajahs, generals, and governors scattered across the nation.

The Moghuls were originally nomadic Tartars from the plains of Mongolia. They were so unused to living in permanent structures that the first palaces they built in India in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries resembled gigantic tents but were made of red sandstone and marble. They were also unused to the heat, so they immediately set about building canals everywhere—they even had canals going through their bedrooms! They sent runners up to the Himalayas to bring them ice for their drinks, and in the summers the entire city—to the last courtesan—moved up to the royal gardens in the cool vale of Kashmir. The country they admired most was Persia. They had passed it on their way to India and had been awed by the glitter of courtly robes and the delicacy of the miniature paintings, and by the exquisite food they had been served. Much of it they introduced into their own courts, sending off to Persia and Afghanistan regularly for melons, pomegranates, plums, grapes, dates, and nuts.

But India has a way of influencing, if not overpowering, everything it comes into contact with. Very soon the mighty Moghuls were chewing the betel leaf, crying in ecstasy over the mango, adding more spices to their Persian meats, and relishing the vegetarian dishes prepared for them by their Hindu wives and mistresses. It was this combination of richly cooked Persian meats and rice (sometimes called Moghul food) with the local vegetarian styles that gave birth to what I call the Delhi cuisine.

Although this book basically contains the food of the Delhi region, I have, I must confess, cheated slightly to include a few recipes for foods which were cooked in our home but which orginated in other states. I feel very attached to these dishes, and as this is essentially a personal book, I had no compunction about including things that have been adapted in my own kitchen.

I'm sure many readers are curious about just how different the other Indian cuisines really are. One tends to think of India as one large subcontinent almost the size of Europe (without Russia). It is divided into about twenty states and territories. (I say "about" because the number keeps changing.) Each state has its own language, history, literature, dress, and culinary traditions. Transportation of fresh produce isn't particularly efficient, reliable, or cheap, so each area tends to eat what it produces locally. In some states like Kerala, Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh, the staple is rice, whereas in others like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, the staple is wheat. Along the coast fish and seafood are eaten extensively and are often cooked in coconut milk. In the northern interior, where people see neither the sea nor coconut palms, they usually eat an unleavened whole-wheat bread with _dal_ and vegetables.

In Bengal, I've had an entire meal consisting of five different lobster dishes served with rice, the most delicious being one in which the lobster was cooked with mustard seeds and freshly grated coconut. This was followed by Bengali sweets—tiny squares, rectangles, and balls, no bigger than a sugar cube, colored pink, green, and yellow and made with milk, cheese, and sugar.

In Kashmir, where the people are often red-haired, green-eyed, and freckled, the staple diet is meat, fish, and rice. Meat and vegetables are dried during the summer months and stored to be used once the snow begins to fall and movement becomes restricted. The spices used are those which are thought to provide heat for the body—cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, black peppers, chilies. Even their tea is delicately spiced. Kashmiri food often has a red appearance owing to the liberal use of the Kashmiri chili, which is not very hot but provides flavor and color. I've had meals in Srinagar in which every course was meat, including a mincemeat dessert.

Modern Bombay boasts of hundreds of instant products; the label on one reads: "Instant Dal. SAVE time, labor, money. By adding only water, READY within three minutes." Side by side with this evidence of "progress," Gujarati-speaking people of Bombay still relish more traditional foods. One great favorite is a paper-thin bread, eaten with the pulp of the best seasonal mangoes. This bread is made by dipping two balls of whole-wheat dough into fat and flour, rolling them out together very thinly, and toasting them on a hot griddle. The two layers are then separated, making an ever finer, lighter bread. Another favorite is _undhya_ (meaning upside down). Whole, often unpeeled vegetables, coated with oil, red pepper, garlic, ginger, fenugreek, coriander, fennel, and cumin, are put into an earthenware pot and covered with moistened hay. The pot is then turned upside down over smoldering cinders.

In Madras, it is customary to eat on the floor, out of a banana leaf, which serves as a plate. A mountain of rice is piled on the leaf, and a visitor unaccustomed to the southern ways begins to wonder how he can ever find room for all that rice. The host's deft hands quickly make a craterlike hole in the mountain top, and into this is poured the highly spiced hot _sambar_ (yellow lentils, cooked with asafetida, fenugreek, coriander, cumin, turmeric, chilies, mustard seed, and tamarind, to which have been added sliced vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, and eggplant). This is eaten with great relish, the entire palm of the right hand, from fingertips to wrist, being used to transport the food from leaf to mouth. The Northerners tend to look down on the Southerners for what they consider to be rather messy eating habits. In the North, the finicky pale when they see anyone soiling more than the top section of his fingers with food. I remember being scolded by my mother for letting the food slip from fingertip to midfinger. Whenever that happened, she would say, "Chhi, chhi, chhi" (dirty, dirty, dirty) and make me wash my hand. Whether we soil the digital end or the whole palm, one thing at least is generally true of all Indians: we like to eat with our hands. For this reason we have strict rules about washing hands and mouths before and after meals. This rule is followed meticulously by the poorest villager and the richest urbanite.

Some day, I hope, books will be written about all of India's cuisines—Gujarati food, Malayali food, Assamese food, Punjabi food, Maharashtrian food, Sindhi food, Bengali food, Goan food, Kashmiri food, Hyderabadi food, to name just a few. But until that happens, my book can introduce you to the smells and tastes which _I_ grew up with as a child in Delhi and which I have struggled over the years to re-create in my American kitchen. These dishes, some traditional and some adapted to the produce in American supermarkets, you can now cook in your own homes instead of having to rely on second-rate eating places or the mercy of Indian acquaintances.

# _Two words of advice_

Avoid using aluminum pans when cooking with any ingredients that have acidity.

If you aren't familiar with Indian cooking, it is wise to grind, measure, and set out _all_ your ingredients before starting the cooking because so often parts of a recipe require that you work without interruption.

# _A note on flavorings_

Most of the spices used for Indian cooking are available in American supermarkets. It is best to buy spices whole, as they tend to retain their flavor for longer periods. They can be ground at home in an electric blender or coffee grinder in small quantities and then stored in tightly covered containers. (A mortar and pestle can be used to crush spices, but it will not grind them finely.)

There are, however, certain spices and ingredients which are unavailable in local supermarkets. These can generally be found in specialty food stores. If you don't have one near you, you can order special ingredients by mail. A list of stores, most of which accept mail orders, is provided in the List of Sources.

There are also some special herbs which give Indian foods their characteristic flavors—like Chinese parsley and ginger. The best places to find such ingredients are Chinese, Spanish, or Indian grocery stores.

AMCHOOR | Raw mango, dried and ground. It makes food tangy and sour. In North India it is used as freely as lemon is in American cooking. It also comes in dried slices.  
---|---  
ASAFETIDA | A smelly resin which is used in very small quantities for vegetarian foods. It is available as a lump, or broken into pebbles, or powdered. The lump variety is generally the purest. Break off tiny chips (with a hammer, if necessary) and keep the rest in a tightly covered jar.  
CARDAMOM | Two varieties are available in America: the greenish pod and the slightly plumper whitish pod. The seeds in the greenish pod are generally more fragrant. The cardamom pod is sometimes used whole, and at other times the skin is discarded and the seeds are ground (a clean pepper mill is excellent for this) and sprinkled over meats and desserts. There is also a large black cardamom, hard to find in America, which is used for certain rice and meat dishes. When this is unavailable, either variety of the smaller cardamom can be substituted. (More information about cardamom as a mouth fresher.)  
CHINESE PARSLEY | Called small _cilantro_ in Spanish stores, fresh coriander or fresh _dhania_ in Indian food stores, and Chinese parsley in Chinese stores, it is used in our food as an herb and a garnish. If unavailable, Italian or ordinary parsley can be substituted. If you have an herb garden, you can grow your own Chinese parsley by planting coriander seeds and waiting until the plants are about 10 inches high. Keep parsley refrigerated in a plastic bag. _N.B_. Dried coriander powder cannot be substituted for fresh parsley.  
CINNAMON | Indians use both stick and ground cinnamon. Stick cinnamon is used whole in certain meat and rice dishes, whereas ground cinnamon is used in meat sauces and vegetables.  
COCONUT | When you buy a coconut, make sure it is not cracked. Shake it to make sure it contains liquid. Even though this liquid is later discarded, it ensures a moist inside. To open, hit the coconut with a hammer and pry it apart. Get the meat out by sliding a sharp knife between the shell and the meat. Before grating the coconut, cut off the dark brown crust on the meat. To roast grated coconut, place it in a heavy skillet (iron is best) over a medium flame. Stir for 3 to 4 minutes or until it begins to turn brown.  
CORIANDER | Coriander seeds can be used whole, ground, or roasted. To roast coriander, place desired amount of ground coriander in a heavy skillet (iron is best) over a medium flame. Stir for 2 to 3 minutes or until coriander turns a few shades darker. Be careful not to burn it. When buying ground coriander, purchase in small quantities.  
CUMIN | Called _comino_ in Spanish stores. Indians use this spice whole, ground, or roasted. To roast cumin, place desired amount of whole seeds in heavy skillet (iron is best) over a medium flame. Stir 2 to 3 minutes or until seeds turn a darker brown. Remove from heat. The cumin can now be ground on an Indian grinding stone if you happen to have one, or it can be crushed just as easily with a mortar and pestle or with a rolling pin. It is best when freshly roasted, but you could keep it a few days in a tightly covered jar. In North India, ground roasted cumin is sprinkled over many yogurt relishes, snacks, and cooked vegetables. When buying ground cumin, purchase in small quantities.  
DRY RED PEPPERS | Dry red peppers or dry red chilies are available in many sizes with just as many variations in their degrees of potency. The kind I have used in my recipes are about an inch long and _very_ hot. I generally use them whole. Remember that red peppers are not essential to Indian food. If you don't like them you can use fewer than suggested or none at all. If whole red peppers are used in cooking, it is a good idea to remove them before serving. They are deadly if bitten into!  
FENNEL | The fennel seed is really a larger, plumper sister of the anise seed. It is excellent in vegetables. It is also roasted and used as an after-dinner mouth freshener.  
FENUGREEK | Fenugreek seeds are yellow in color and rather flat. Since their taste borders on bitterness, very few are used at a time. They are excellent with eggplant and potatoes.  
GARAM MASALA | This is a mixture of several "hot" spices, generally prepared ahead of time in small quantities and used as needed to flavor meats and vegetables. It can be bought in specialty stores, but has a fresher taste if you grind it yourself. To make about a cupful, you will need:  
|  _25 cardamom pods (use seeds only)_  
_½ cup whole black peppercorns_  
_⅓ cup whole cumin seeds_  
_¼ cup whole coriander seeds_  
_3 sticks of cinnamon, each about 3 inches long_  
_4–6 whole cloves_  
| Combine all ingredients and grind very fine, using an electric blender or a coffee grinder. (If you want to make your _garam masala_ less hot, decrease the amount of black peppercorns and increase the cumin proportionately.) Store in a tightly covered container, away from sunlight and dampness. If carefully stored, _this garam masala_ can be kept for a couple of months.  
GHEE | _Ghee_ is the cooking medium used in many parts of India. There are two kinds of _ghee. Usli ghee_ or clarified butter is used rarely, partly because of its expense and partly because many Indians consider it "heavy." The more commonly used _ghee_ resembles American shortening and is a mixture of various vegetable oils. See the Introduction. I tend to use unsaturated oils for most of ßmy cooking. Many Indians use peanut oil or mustard oil. Use whatever you prefer. If you wish to make _usli ghee_ or clarified butter, here is how you do it: Melt butter. Pour off the clear liquid, discarding the milky residue. Store, covered, in the refrigerator.  
GINGER | This is a tan-skinned, knobbly rhizome with a sharp, pungent taste, available in Indian and Chinese food stores. Some specialty food stores carry it as well. It is used for making meat dishes, vegetables, and chutneys. Ginger is generally peeled and then grated or ground. It is easier to grate it if you don't break off the needed section but rather grate it off the whole piece instead. To grind it, chop it coarsely and place in electric blender with a little water. To store ginger, cover it well with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator. It is good until it begins to mold. Another way to keep it is to plant it (bury it) in sandy soil. Water it infrequently. It not only stays fresh this way but also sprouts fresh knobs. Cut off what you need and put the rest back in the soil. Dried ginger "root" (called so mistakenly) is bottled and put out by major spice companies. This can be used as a second-best substitute. It is preferable to powdered ginger, which in India is considered to be so different from fresh ginger that it is called by another name altogether. Follow the instructions on the bottle for presoaking, which must be done a few hours before you plan to cook.  
GREEN CHILIES | Fresh, hot green peppers or chilies are available in some Chinese, Indian, Spanish, and Italian stores. Since chilies vary in their strength, caution must be exercised in using them. The hottest part of the chilies is their seeds, and there are more seeds near the stem. Ideally, each chili should be sampled before being used. You can cut it in half and take the tiniest bite from its center. If it is hot use it sparingly. Most Indians can generally gauge the hotness of a chili by breaking it in two and just smelling it. As a substitute, canned Mexican _jalapenos_ or cayenne pepper can be used. Neither has the taste of a green chili, but both are hot. (See instructions for substitutions in individual recipes.)  
KALONJI | These are black onion seeds which are used occasionally for meat dishes and often for vegetables. If you can't find them, leave them out of the recipe.  
MUSTARD SEEDS | We generally use black mustard seeds, but if you cannot find them, yellow mustard seeds may be substituted. For some recipes, mustard seeds need to be crushed. This is best done with a heavy mortar and pestle or a heavy grinding stone.  
NUTMEG | Buy whole nutmeg and store it in a tightly closed jar. Use a nutmeg grater and grate whenever needed.  
POPPY SEEDS | We use the white poppy seeds. They are generally ground before being cooked. To facilitate grinding, roast them first. Place them in a heavy skillet (iron is best) over a medium flame. Stir them around for 3 to 4 minutes. Now they can be ground with an Indian grinding stone or crushed with a mortar and pestle. If white poppy seeds cannot be found, do without them.  
SAFFRON | This very expensive stigma of the crocus flower is used in Moghlai meat and rice dishes as well as in desserts. Ideally, saffron stigmas or "leaf" saffron should be lightly roasted in a hot skillet, crumbled, and allowed to soak in a tablespoon or so of warm milk for half an hour before being used.  
TAMARIND PASTE | The tamarind is a kind of bean, which grows on large trees. For commercial use it is peeled, seeded, and pressed into a lump. Indians use its paste to add a special kind of tartness to their foods. Lump tamarind is available in Indian and Middle Eastern specialty stores in America. These stores also sell a bottled tamarind paste, but this is often extremely fermented. To make your own tamarind paste, break or pull a golf-ball-sized piece from the lump tamarind and soak it in ¾ cup hot water for 3 to 4 hours or overnight. Use a small, nonmetallic cup or bowl. Press pulp through a strainer and reserve. (You may need to add extra water to the strainer in order to dislodge all the pulp.) Discard whatever is left in the strainer. Covered tamarind pulp can be stored several days in the refrigerator. Lump tamarind should be wrapped in a plastic bag and stored in the refrigerator. It will last for months.  
TURMERIC | This spice is really a boiled-down root which is available in small lumps in India but only in its ground form in America. It is this yellow spice which gives coloring to a lot of our foods. It burns easily, so care should be taken when cooking with it.  
VARK | These are extremely fine, delicate sheets of real silver (or gold) foil, used for garnishing. (They _are_ eaten.) When you buy them, generally each sheet is between 2 layers of tissue paper. _You cannot lift a sheet by picking it up with your hand:_ it will disintegrate or fly away. Remove one layer of tissue paper carefully, leaving the _vark_ on the other sheet. Slide your hand under the paper and invert the _vark_ on the food. Garnish thinly, as you should not really be able to taste the _vark_. The effect is prettier when the _vark_ lies on the food in an unbroken sheet, but it's all right if it disintegrates slightly. _Vark_ is available only at Indian specialty stores. Since it can tarnish, like any real silver, it should be stored in a dark, airtight container.

# _Kitchen utensils and other equipment_

Here is a list of some utensils which are found only in Indian kitchens.

CHIMTA | These flat, smooth-edged, long tongs are used for everything from picking up live coals to turning over bread.  
---|---  
KARHAI | This is a utensil for deep frying. Like the Chinese wok, it is curved at the bottom and very wide at the top, rather like a half-moon. It can be made of cast iron, aluminum, stainless steel, or brass.  
KATORI | Small bowl made out of gold, silver, stainless steel, or aluminum, used to serve individual portions of meat, vegetables, and _dals_. Often several filled _katoris_ are arranged on a _thali_ and the _thali_ is then placed before the diner.  
MUTKA | Round pot of half-baked clay used for storing water and excellent for making "water pickles."  
PARAAT | This is a large, wide-rimmed brass tray, used for kneading bread. It is also used as a serving tray at weddings.  
SIL BATTA | The North Indian grinding stone comes in 2 sections. The _sil_ , or larger stone, is about a foot long, 9 inches wide, and 2 inches high. It is pockmarked with tiny, shallow ridges. Food is placed on this larger stone for grinding. The grinding is done by the _batta_ , the second, smaller, half-moon-shaped stone, which is about 6 inches long and 1½ inches thick. _(N.B_. The sizes and shapes of Indian grinding stones vary in the different states.)  
TANDOOR | A large clay oven utilizing coal or wood as fuel and used for baking chicken, fish, meat, lentils, and breads. Very popular in the Punjab.  
TAVA | This is a slightly curved, cast-iron griddle, useful for making breads and patties.  
THALI OR THAL | Gold, silver, brass, or aluminum tray used both for serving and as a plate. The Bohris of Gujarat place a large _thal_ on a stool and use it as a table.

 hile India does not, as a nation, drink soup, we have, fortunately, many communities within the subcontinent that insist on being exceptions to the rule. The Anglo-Indians (a 300-year-old community with a mixed English and Indian heritage) make a delicious mulligatawny soup (a corruption of the Tamil words _milagu-tannir_ , meaning "pepper water") with meat and chickpea flour, and the Bohris of Gujarat make a superb "white soup" _(safed sarvo)_ with goat's meat and milk.

The appetizers you will find in this chapter are those among the Indian "snack" foods that can be most conveniently eaten with drinks—triangular _samosas_ , filled with meat or potatoes, small vegetable fritters, and ground meat _kababs. Kababs_ , often sprinkled with finely sliced onion rings, are favorites among Indian Scotch drinkers. The North Indian word for alcoholic beverages is _sharab_ , and it is very interesting that the North Indian label for a man who drinks and eats well is sharabi-kababi!

## _Mulligatawny soup_

SERVES 4

Judging from the Tamil origin of the name "mulligatawny" one might deduce that it originated in the Madras region 100 to 300 years ago under the benevolent gaze of British patronage. British in concept but Indian in its ingredients, this hearty soup became very popular with the Anglo-Indians scattered all across India, and there are probably as many recipes for it as there are Anglo-Indian families. My favorite was the one made by a family who eventually decided to migrate to Australia. The day before their departure they came to our house to say good-bye. I remember that we all sat out on the lawn and I begged them to leave their recipe for mulligatawny soup with me. This is their recipe.

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ½-inch cube, peeled and chopped_

_½ pound boneless lamb (from shoulder or leg), with fat removed, and cut into ¾-inch cubes_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 tablespoonwhite poppy seeds, roasted and ground_

_½ teaspoon ground coriander_

_½ teaspoon ground cumin_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_⅓ teaspoon salt (more if the broth is unsalted)_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_2 tablespoons chickpea flour_

_2 cups chicken broth (canned or homemade)_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_2–3 tablespoons cooked rice, or 1–1½ tablespoons uncooked rice (optional)_

Put the garlic and ginger into the container of an electric blender with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste. Set aside.

Pat dry the pieces of lamb. Heat the oil in a 2–3-quart pot over medium-high flame, and add the meat. Turn, and fry until the pieces are lightly browned on all sides. Remove with slotted spoon and set aside. Turn the heat off.

To the same pot, add the paste from the blender, the roasted and ground poppy seeds, the coriander, cumin, and turmeric. Turn the heat to medium, and fry, stirring constantly, for about a minute. Turn heat to low.

Now add the browned meat and any juice that may have accumulated, the salt, cayenne, and black pepper. Stir and leave on low flame.

Combine chickpea flour and ¼ cup water in a bowl, mixing thoroughly until you have a smooth paste. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring as you do so. Pour this mixture over the meat in the pot. Turn heat to high and bring soup to a boil. Add uncooked rice if you are using it. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for half an hour or until meat is tender. Stir in the lemon juice.

If you are using cooked rice, add it to soup 5 minutes before serving. Pour the soup into a tureen or into individual bowls. Mulligatawny soup can be served with both Indian and Western-style meals. Since it is thick and fairly filling, it can be a main course for lunch or a light supper followed by a green salad and fruit.

## _White soup (safed sarvo)_

SERVES 4–6

This relatively unknown but delicious soup is made by the Bohris of Gujarat. It is brought to the table in a large serving bowl. The eldest lady of the house then asks how many people want their soup flavored with lemon, and she squeezes fresh lemon over one section, leaving the rest plain. Next, she ladles the soup into small Chinese-style bowls, the lemony part of the soup going to those who asked for it. The white color comes from the milk and almonds (or cashews, if you like).

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ½-inch cube_

_1½ pounds neck of lamb, with bone left in, cut into 1–1½-inch cubes_

_1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped_

_4 cups beef broth (canned or fresh; do not use bouillon)_

_½ teaspoon salt (more if beef broth is unsalted)_

_1 bay leaf_

_1 tablespoon blanched slivered almonds (or unroasted cashews)_

_1 cup milk_

_4 tablespoons whole-wheat flour (use plain flour as substitute)_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 tablespoon vegetable oil_

_⅛ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

GARNISH

_2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves, chopped (parsley may be substituted)_

_1 lemon cut into 6 wedges_

Put the garlic and ginger into the container of an electric blender, along with ¼ cup water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

In a largish pot, combine the meat, chopped onions, garlic and ginger paste, beef broth, salt, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer gently for 1½ hours.

Meanwhile, soak the blanched almonds in the milk.

In a small, heavy-bottomed skillet, dry-roast the whole-wheat flour over a medium flame, stirring constantly until the flour is 2 or 3 shades darker (this should take about 3 minutes). Then turn off flame and pour flour into a medium-sized bowl.

When the soup has cooked for an hour and a half, take out a cup of the boiling liquid and mix it well with the roasted whole-wheat flour in the bowl. When the mixture is smooth, pour it back into the pot of soup.

Put the milk and almonds into the blender and blend at high speed until you have a thin, smooth paste. Add to the simmering soup.

Taste the soup. Add cayenne if you desire.

Heat the oil in a small skillet over a medium flame. When hot, put in the whole cumin seeds, stirring for a few seconds until seeds begin to pop and darken, then add to the soup. Stir soup again. Turn off heat and leave soup covered.

To serve: This soup can be served with or without the pieces of meat (remove bay leaf though!). Garnish with chopped mint leaves and serve lemon wedges on the side.

## _Dal soup_

SERVES 8

My mother used to make this mild-flavored "split-pea" soup. The only spices in it were cloves, peppercorns, and turmeric. It was served with lemon wedges and homemade croutons.

_1½ cups green or yellow split peas, washed_

_6 cups chicken broth (canned or homemade)_

_24 black peppercorns *_

_15 whole cloves *_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_½–¾ teaspoon salt (more if broth is unsalted)_

* _tied in cheesecloth_

GARNISH

_8 lemon wedges_

_Croutons made from 6 slices of slightly stale bread and enough_

_vegetable oil to cover ½–¾ inch in a 10-inch skillet_

Combine the split peas and chicken broth in a pot and bring to a boil. Remove scum from the top.

Add the spices in the cheesecloth, the turmeric, and the salt. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 1 to 1½ hours or until peas are tender. Remove cheesecloth from soup, squeeze its juices into soup, and discard. Check salt.

Press the soup through a strainer, using the back of a wooden spoon, or put it through a food mill. If the soup seems too thick, add a little water.

To serve: Heat soup. Serve in bowls, garnished with a lemon wedge. Pass around croutons on the side.

TO MAKE CROUTONS

(These can be prepared ahead of time.)

Remove crusts and cut slices of bread into ½-inch cubes.

Heat oil in skillet over medium flame, and put in a third of the croutons. Fry for 3 or 4 minutes, turning them around, until they are golden brown. Lift out with slotted spoon and leave to drain on paper towels. Prepare the rest of the croutons in two more batches, and leave to drain.

## _Potato soup_

SERVES 4

_1 tablespoon vegetable oil_

_A pinch of ground asafetida, or a 1⁄16-inch pebble broken from the chunk asafetida_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and quartered_

_2 tablespoons tomato paste_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1¼ teaspoons salt_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

Heat the oil in a 3-quart pot over a medium flame, put in the asafetida and the cumin, and stir once. In a few seconds, when the cumin seeds begin to sizzle, add the quartered potatoes, tomato paste, turmeric, salt, and cayenne. Stir, and continue to fry for 2 minutes.

Add 4 cups of water and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes.

Turn off heat and lift cover. Mash potatoes coarsely with a potato masher or with the back of a slotted spoon.

To serve: Pour soup into small bowls or _katoris_ and serve.

## _Cold yogurt soup_

SERVES 4

Here is a very refreshing summer soup.

_1 cup plain yogurt_

_½ cup heavy cream_

_⅓–½ teaspoon salt_

_A sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper_

_4 tablespoons peeled and grated cucumber_

_10–12 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped_

Combine all ingredients in bowl with ½ cup of cold water. Mix well. Cover and chill for several hours until ready to serve.

To serve: Serve on hot days in small chilled bowls or _katoris_.

## _Khatte aloo (sour potatoes)_

SERVES 10–12

This is an adaptation of a street-side snack to be found in different forms all over North India.

_7 medium-sized potatoes, boiled ahead of time, and set aside for at least 2 hours to cool_

_1½ teaspoons salt (or to taste)_

_2–3 tablespoons lemon juice (or to taste)_

_2 teaspoons ground roastedcumin_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

Peel the cooled potatoes and dice them into ½-inch cubes. Place in large bowl. Add remaining ingredients. Mix well. Check to see if salt and lemon juice are in correct proportion.

To serve: Place potatoes on platter and stick with toothpicks. Serve with drinks.

## _Vegetable pakoris_

SERVES 6–8

These _pakoris_ are vegetable fritters—something like an Indian tempura. They are generally eaten with tea, but there is no reason why they cannot be served with drinks. I have specified potatoes in this recipe, but you could use any of the following instead:

_1-inch flowerets of cauliflower (a small head),  
or 1⁄16-inch-thick onion rings (4 medium-sized onions),  
or Italian peppers, cut in half lengthwise (½–¾ pound)_

You can also make a plate of mixed _pakoris_ , using different vegetables.

THE BATTER

_1 cup chickpea flour, sifted_

_¼ teaspoon salt_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¼ teaspoon ground cumin_

_¼ teaspoon baking soda_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

THE FILLING

_3 medium-sized potatoes, peeled (or other vegetables—see above)_

_Vegetable oil, enough for 2½–3 inches in wok,karhai, or other utensil for deep frying_

_Salt and pepper for sprinkling on cooked pakoris_

Put the chickpea flour in a bowl. Gradually mix in about ¾ cup water, until you have a thickish batter—thick enough to coat the vegetables. Add the other batter ingredients and mix well.

Cut the potatoes into rounds 1⁄16 inch thick, and put into a bowl of cold water.

Heat oil over a low flame until hot but not smoking. Take a few potato slices at a time, wipe them dry, and dip them in the batter. Now drop them into the oil. Fry slowly, 7 to 10 minutes on each side, until they are cooked through and have turned a golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Do all _pakoris_ this way, never putting in more at one time than your deep-frying utensil will hold in one layer.

To serve: _Serve pakoris_ while they are crisp and hot with either the Fresh Green Chutney with Chinese Parsley and Yogurt or Fresh Mint Chutney with Fruit. The chutney is used as a dip. If you're feeling lazy, tomato ketchup or Chinese duck sauce or a combination of soy sauce, white vinegar, grated fresh ginger, and a dash of Tabasco can be used as alternative dips.

## _Pappadums, or papars_

SERVES 8–10

_Pappadums_ (as they are called in the South) and _papars_ (as they are called in the North) are wafers, usually made out of a _dal_ dough which is rolled out and dried. (You can also buy _sago_ wafers and potato wafers, but they are less popular.) _Papars_ can be bought in specialty stores in two basic varieties—spiced and unspiced. The spiced ones often have a liberal sprinkling of crushed black pepper in them. They are deep-fried in hot oil and served at cocktail parties. The frying takes just a few seconds. _Papars_ cannot be fried too far in advance, as any moisture in the air tends to make them go limp and they should be crisp. _Papars_ come in several sizes. The large ones can be broken in half and then fried. They expand a bit as they are cooked. Before you set out to make them, put a large platter, well lined with paper towels, beside the stove to drain the _papars_.

_10 papars or pappadums_

_Oil for deep-frying, enough for 2 inches in 10-inch skillet_

Heat oil in skillet over medium flame. When hot, put in one _papar_. It should sizzle and expand immediately. (If it doesn't, your oil is not hot enough!) Turn it over, leave for a few seconds, and remove with slotted spoon. Place on platter with paper towels and drain. Do all _papars_ this way, one at a time. If they begin to brown, your oil is too hot. Turn down the heat. The _papars_ should retain their yellow color.

To serve: Serve warm or at room temperature with drinks.

## _Seekh kabab, flat style_

SERVES 8–10

This version of the ground meat _kabab_ is excellent to serve with drinks and to take out on picnics. The meat and spices can be combined a night in advance and left, covered, in the refrigerator.

_½ medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and chopped_

_20 whole black peppercorns_

_10 whole cloves_

_Seeds from 8 cardamom pods_

_1 fresh hot green chili, sliced (optional)_

_½ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

_4 tablespoons chick pea flour_

_2½ pounds chuck, ground three times_

_1 cup (loosely packed) chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional—use as desired)_

_1 egg, beaten_

_5 tablespoons melted butter_

In the container of an electric blender, combine the chopped onions, garlic, ginger, peppercorns, cloves, cardamom seeds, green chili, nutmeg, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat a small iron skillet or griddle over medium flame. Put in the chickpea flour and stir until it is 2 or 3 shades darker. Remove from heat.

In a large bowl, combine the meat, the chopped parsley, the contents of the blender container, the cumin, coriander, salt, cayenne, and roasted chickpea flour. Mix well with your hands. Cover and refrigerate until ready to broil (overnight if convenient).

Take meat out of refrigerator 45 minutes before serving.

Preheat broiler.

Add beaten egg to meat and mix well.

Line 10-by-15-inch baking tray with foil, and brush it with half the melted butter.

Spread the meat mixture in the tray: it should be ⅓ to ½ inch thick. Brush the top with the rest of the melted butter. Place under broiler, 3 to 4 inches away from heat. Broil until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove with a bulb baster any liquid that may accumulate.

Cut meat into 1½–2-inch squares.

Serve hot, or cold, with Raw Onion Rings and Fresh Green Chutney with Chinese Parsley and Yogurt or Fresh Mint Chutney with Fruit.

## _Leftover ham on toast_

SERVES 8–10

This dish of my own devising can be made with any leftover roasts. I have used ham, but you could use lamb or beef or pork, in which case salt should be added.

_2 cups (well packed) diced cooked ham_

_1 medium-sized potato, boiled, peeled, and diced_

_½ medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped_

_1 teaspoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped finely_

_½ cup washed Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional—use as desired)_

_⅛ teaspoon ground cloves_

_⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_3 tablespoonstamarind paste  
or 1½-tablespoons lemon juice_

_Rounds of small cocktail rye bread,  
or Melba rounds,  
or any firm bread slices, crust removed, cut into 4 rectangles_

_3 tablespoons melted butter_

Put the ham, potato, onion, ginger, garlic, and parsley through the fine blade of a meat grinder. Add black pepper, cayenne pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and tamarind paste or lemon juice. Mix well with hands. You can do this much ahead of time and keep it covered in refrigerator.

Twenty-five minutes before serving time, preheat broiler.

If using bread, spread out as many slices as will fit on a large baking sheet, and lightly toast one side. Remove from broiler and turn over.

Spread other side with the ham paste ¼–⅓ inch thick. (Melba rounds do not need toasting on one side. You can just spread ham mixture on them directly.) Make sure the edges of bread or Melba toast are covered or you will burn them. Brush with melted butter. Place under broiler and broil 7 to 8 minutes or until golden brown. Do as many batches as you need.

To serve: Place on platter and serve hot with drinks.

## _Jumbo shrimp on toothpicks_

SERVES 4

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and chopped_

_1½ pounds jumbo shrimp,peeled and deveined_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_3 tablespoons tomato paste_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

Put the garlic and ginger in the container of an electric blender along with 3 tablespoons water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Wash shrimp well and pat them dry. Cut each shrimp into 3 sections. Set aside.

Heat oil in 10–12-inch skillet over medium flame. When hot, pour in the paste from blender and fry, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and turmeric. Fry and stir another 2 minutes. Add 4 tablespoons water, the lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper. Cover, and simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes. (This much can be done in advance.)

Five minutes before serving time, lift off cover, put in the shrimp, and turn heat to high. Stir and fry the shrimp for about 5 minutes or until they just turn opaque.

To serve: Place on platter and stick toothpicks into each shrimp piece. Serve hot.

## _Whole-wheat samosas_

SERVES 8–10

_Samosas_ are deep-fried patties, filled with potatoes or ground meat. I have a simple version of them. This is how they are made. (For stuffing use recipe for _Sookhe Aloo_ or _Kheema_.)

_2 cups whole-wheat flour_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil (plus a little extra for brushing on dough)_

_½ teaspoon salt_

_Vegetable oil for deep frying, enough for 3–3½ inches in pot_

Combine oil and flour and rub together. Add salt and mix. Add 1 cup water, a little at a time, until you have a firm dough. Knead the dough well for 7 to 10 minutes, until smooth. Form into a ball. Brush with a little oil, and cover with a damp cloth. Set aside until ready for use.

If using _Sookhe Aloo_ for stuffing, cook it according to the recipe and then crush potatoes coarsely with the back of a slotted spoon.

If using _Kheema_ for stuffing, cook _Kheema_ until it is very dry, with no liquid left at all. If any fat has accumulated, it should be discarded.

Divide dough into 28 to 30 equal balls. (Each ball makes _2 samosas_ , so you'll end up with about 60.) Flatten each ball and roll it out on a floured surface until it is 3½ to 4 inches in diameter. Cut each round in half. Taking one semicircle at a time, moisten half the length of the cut edge with a finger dipped in water. Form a wide cone with the semicircle, using the moist section to overlap ¼ inch and hold it closed. Fill _samosa_ three-fourths full with the stuffing. Moisten the inside edges of the opening and press it shut. Seal this end by pressing down on the outside with the tip of a fork, as you would a pie crust. Prepare the _samosas_ this way and keep them covered with a plastic wrap.

When you are ready to fry them, heat the oil in a wok, _karhai_, or a utensil for deep frying. Keep the heat at medium. When oil is hot, drop a _samosa_ in to check the temperature. It should start sizzling immediately. Fry 2 to 3 minutes, or until it looks a warm brown. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Do all _samosas_ this way. If they brown too fast, lower your heat.

They can be reheated in a 300° oven.

To serve: Place _samosas_ on platter and serve hot or warm with either Fresh Green Chutney with Chinese Parsley and Yogurt or Fresh Mint Chutney with Fruit. The chutney is used as a dip.

## _Cocktail koftas_

SERVES 15

Follow recipe. Make the _koftas_ smaller, about ¼ inch in diameter. They can be made a day in advance, and then reheated.

When serving, keep _koftas_ warm in chafing dish. Place toothpicks nearby to aid self-service.

## _Broiled chicken strips_

SERVES 8–10

See recipe. Instead of cutting chicken breasts into strips 1½ to 2 inches long, cut them into strips that are 1 inch long and ½ inch wide. Follow the rest of the recipe.

To serve: Place on warm platter and stick with toothpicks. Serve with drinks.

 hen an Indian sits down to eat meat, it is nearly always goat meat. The English have translated the meat as mutton, but it is not to be confused with the aged sheep meat available in England, Australia, and New Zealand. Perhaps the English in India didn't know what else to call it—or perhaps they found a dish called "mutton chops" more palatable than if it was called plain old "goat chops." Who knows!

At any rate, "mutton" in India is not old sheep meat—far from it. It is usually _very_ fresh goat meat and therefore not always very tender. Because of the lack of proper refrigeration facilities in India (most butchers cannot afford any) the animals are slaughtered daily and the meat is sold within 24 hours. In the richer homes it is then washed and refrigerated or frozen. But in the poorer homes it is cooked immediately. Since the meat is fairly tough, it is cooked slowly, over a longish period of time. For quicker fried and grilled dishes, the meat has to be tenderized first. The cheapest and most common tenderizer is crushed green papaya, but marinades of vinegar and yogurt are also used.

Not only is Indian goat meat a little on the tough side; it is also very lean. The result is that we use a great deal of cooking fat to brown our meats. We tend to like this "browned" look. When I buy lamb here in America (lamb is the best substitute for the Indian "mutton"), I first trim away all signs of fat. Then, to make it taste like the food I have in India, I cook it in lots of oil. This cooking fat can, of course, be removed later, once the dish is completely cooked, by spooning it off the top just before serving.

There is another significant difference in the quality of Indian meat which influences cooking techniques. In India, meat dropped into fat can be expected to fry, slowly or quickly, as the cook desires. Here, in America, if a pound of meat is put into oil to fry, unless one has taken careful preliminary steps, it will start boiling. The meat here gives off a lot of water, possibly because of prior freezing or because of the water-injecting habits of some butchers. There is no really good way to avoid this extra water, but defrosting frozen meat completely and wiping it well before cooking will be somewhat helpful. You can also fry the meat over a high flame in small quantities or boil off the extra liquid toward the end of the cooking time. As I go along I will tell you, in each recipe, which step to follow. What I want you to understand here is _why_ an Indian meat dish cooked in America will never taste quite the same as it does in India.

Contrary to what most outsiders think, beef _is_ eaten in India. About 80 percent of India is Hindu (those who, technically, do not eat beef) but the other 20 percent includes 60 million Muslims and 12 million Christians, i.e., 72 million people who can eat beef without battling their consciences first. Every now and then, when it seems politic, there is a rousing debate in our parliament on the subject of cow slaughter. But while cows ("The cow is your mother," they say) are being heatedly discussed, no one is saying much about the buffalo (a kind of poor relation, I suppose), so this creature is being slaughtered and sold—though not always in the open market. A very popular dish in most "Western"-style Indian restaurants is the "sizzling" steak (alas—buffalo), and I must say I have seen many a Hindu devour this with great relish. It does not taste as good as the best American steak, but it is served very attractively right on the platter on which it is cooked, accompanied by a lot of hissing and sizzling vegetables.

When beef is cooked in the Indian manner, it is cooked like mutton, slowly, over a period of time. In some areas, beef is dried and then fried with onions and served at breakfast. I have also eaten it cooked with spinach and with potatoes. One strange thing that I have noticed about us Indians is that although many Hindus will eat beef in restaurants, in Muslim and Christian homes, and when they are abroad, very few will cook it in their own kitchens. Each country has its own varieties of national hypocrisy. Self-righteously proclaimed rules on diet and cleanliness seem to be part of our heritage.

Besides "mutton" and beef, pork, lamb, and venison are also eaten in the areas where they are found. _Dumba_ , a fan-tailed sheep, is used for a special _pullao_ (a rice and meat dish) cooked at the Muslim festival _Id_. Venison, considered rather dry, is often made into _koftas_ (meatballs) or _shami kababs_ (ground meat patties).

Meat is, of course, cooked very differently in the different regions of India. Most of my recipes are for dishes eaten in and around my hometown, Delhi. I will start with the easier recipes. My aim is to interest you first, and then entice you on—slowly.

# _Cuts of meat to use_

Generally, when Indians cook a simple, everyday meat dish, they use meat with bone. This could come from the neck, shoulder, shank, ribs, or elsewhere from the goat or sheep. Often they combine these different parts, add some chunks from the leg, and throw in a few extra dark marrow bones for good measure. (These coveted marrow bones, once cooked, are fought over by the children with the winner gleefully digging out the delicious marrow with long, slim spoons!) When I buy lamb in America for stew-type dishes, I use all the cuts just mentioned. But I find that most Americans, eating with a knife and fork (and more often with only a fork), do not seem to be much attracted to cubes of meat that are often three-fourths bone and one-forth meat. When you eat with your hands, there is a great deal of pleasure to be derived from tearing meat off a bone with your teeth, and from sucking the bones. Since this is seldom done in America, I have limited myself a great deal to cubed, boned meat from shoulder of lamb. Any butcher will bone and trim the meat, but if you do not have access to a butcher you can buy shoulder chops from the supermarket and cut and trim them yourself. Just cut around the bones (these can be saved for soup), trim off the big concentrations of fat, and then cut the meat into 1–1½ inch cubes. Generally, you can assume a waste of about forty to fifty per cent—so if you buy 4 pounds of shoulder chops, you are likely to end up with about 2 pounds of meat or a bit more.

Leg of lamb can be used for a great many of the following recipes that require cubed meat, but it tends to get rather dry when cooked in a stewlike manner. It should be saved for grills and barbecues (see the chapter on summer cooking). However, if you wish to use it, cook it for the same length of time as meat from the shoulder—about an hour and fifteen minutes.

Neck and shank are excellent for stews but require longer cooking time—about two hours or more. Serve them to people who like bones. You will need to buy about 4 pounds to serve 4–6 since so much of it will be bone. You will also need to increase the salt a bit as some of it will be absorbed by the marrow.

Stewing beef may be substituted for cubed lamb. Here again, increase the cooking time, in this case to about 2½ hours, and adjust the recipes accordingly.

## _Khare masale ka gosht (meat with whole spices)_

SERVES 4–6

Here is my first meat recipe for this book. It is very easy to make and has a delicately flavored taste. By placing it first, I hope to lure you all toward the more complicated and the more heavily spiced meat recipes. This dish is normally made with goat meat, using either the leg or the neck and shoulders, cubed into 1-inch pieces. If the neck and shoulders are used, the bones are always left in. Since we eat with our hands, none of the meat is wasted, the fingers making their way around the oddly shaped bones more easily than a knife and fork. You can, however, use either beef or lamb. If you use beef, get round or chuck, cubed. If you use lamb, and don't want bones, get the butcher to give you 2 pounds of meat from the shoulder. Trim the larger chunks of fat from the meat, and cut it into 1-inch cubes.

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 stick cinnamon, 2 inches long_

_20 whole black peppercorns_

_15 whole cloves_

_10 whole cardamom pods_

_2 bay leaves_

_1 whole dried hot pepper (or more, according to taste)_

_2 pounds boneless meat from shoulder of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes, with fat and tissues removed_

_1–1½ teaspoons salt (according to taste)_

_1 teaspoon garam masala (optional)_

GARNISH

_1 tablespoon trimmed, chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_¼ teaspoon freshly groundcardamom seeds_

Pat the meat dry on paper towels.

Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. When it is very hot, put the spices in quickly in this order: first the cinnamon, then black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom pods, and bay leaves, and finally the hot peppers.

When the hot peppers begin to change color and darken, add the pieces of meat and the salt. Stir for 5 minutes or until the pot begins to make boiling noises. Cover, lower heat, and cook for approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes—or until the meat is tender.

Remove the cover and continue cooking on medium heat for a final 3 to 5 minutes, gently stirring the meat pieces. Take care not to break them. The meat is done now. It should look a nice brown, be tender, and have no sauce other than what is clinging to it and the fat it cooked in.

To serve: In India the contents of the pot are put into a serving bowl, I teaspoon of _garam masala_ is sprinkled on the top, and the dish is served with hot _chapatis_ or Rice with Spinach. I tend to think most Americans would be rather put off if they saw so much fat lining the serving dish, so I suggest that you lift the meat and spices out with a slotted spoon (the spices, though not to be eaten, make an attractive garnish). Place them on a serving platter and serve them sprinkled with chopped Chinese parsley and freshly ground cardamom. You could serve almost any vegetable or _dal_ as an accompaniment—for example, green beans and _urad dal_. Plain rice or hot _chapatis_ are also good. This dish can be made a day before, cooled, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat gently and serve.

## _Pyazwala khare masale ka gosht (meat with whole spices and onions)_

SERVES 4–6

When I was a student in London and had written home begging my mother to teach me how to cook, one of the earliest letters I received from her was dated 9 March 1956, and said, "I received your letter. I am glad to know you have gained weight. I miss you and cannot wait to see you in your new 'plump' state. Your younger sister is supposed to be studying for her exams and your father has even given up his room for her, but she spends all her time reading novels. Here is the recipe for the _Khare Masale Ka Gosht_ that you asked for. Write and tell me how it works out...."It worked out very well!

Here it is. It's very much like the preceding recipe, with the addition of onions, ginger, and cumin seeds, and it has one extra step.

_2 pounds boneless meat from shoulder of lamb, with extra fat removed, cut into 1–1½ inch cubes_

_4 onions_

_9 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_10 whole cardamom pods_

_4 whole large black cardamom pods (if available)_

_6–7 bay leaves_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seed_

_3–4 whole hot dried red peppers (optional)_

_5 whole black peppercorns_

_1 piece fresh ginger, 1½ inches by 1½ inches, peeled and minced or grated_

_1–1½ teaspoon salt (according to taste)_

Prepare all the ingredients first. Pat dry the meat pieces thoroughly with paper towel. Peel the onions, cut them in half, then slice in very thin half-circles.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. When it is very hot, put in the onions. Fry, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes or until the onions are a darkish brown and crisp, but not burned and black. Lift out the onions with slotted spoon, taking care that the fat drains back into the cooking pot first. Spread the onions on paper towels, and leave uncovered.

In the same pot, put in the small and large cardamoms, bay leaves, cumin, red peppers, peppercorns, and finally the ginger. Stir for a minute until bay leaves turn dark and ginger sizzles awhile. Now add the wiped meat and the salt.

Stir for about 5 minutes or until the pot begins to make boiling noises. Cover, lower heat, and simmer very gently for 1 hour and 10 minutes or until meat is tender.

Take cover off, add onions, and let the meat cook over medium heat a final 3 to 5 minutes, stirring gently. Take care not to break the meat. All extra liquid should be boiled away, and the meat should look a nice brown and have no sauce other than what is clinging to it and the fat left in the pan.

To serve: See suggestions for preceding recipe.

This is the first Indian dish all Indian students abroad learn to make. It can be cooked plain or with potatoes, peas, or mushrooms.

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 piece fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 stick cinnamon, about 2 inches long_

_4 whole cloves_

_4 black peppercorns_

_1 bay leaf_

_1–2 hot red peppers to taste (optional)_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 large canned tomato or 2 small ones, coarsely chopped_

_2 pounds finely ground chuck, or ground lamb_

_¾–1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Place chopped onions, garlic, and ginger in blender with 3 tablespoons water and blend to smooth paste (1 minute). Set aside.

Heat oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. When hot, add cinnamon stick, cloves, black peppercorns, bay leaf, and last the red peppers. In about 10 seconds, when the peppers turn dark, add paste from blender, keeping your face averted. Fry for about 10 minutes, adding a sprinkling of water if the food sticks to the bottom. Add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric, and fry another 5 minutes. Now put the chopped tomato in, fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, and add the chopped meat and the salt. Fry on high heat about 5 minutes. Break up all the lumps in the meat and brown it as much as you can. Add ½ cup water and the lemon juice. Bring to boil and cover. Lower flame and let it simmer for 1 hour.

To serve: This dish is rather like chili con carne without the chili. Serve it with rice, or _chapatis_ , or _parathas_ , and any vegetables you like. If serving it with a rice dish, e.g., Rice with Potatoes and Cumin Seed, serve a _moong_ or _masoor dal_ with it.

## _Kheema with fried onions_

SERVES 6

This is easily my favorite _kheema_ recipe. Nutmeg, mace, and yogurt are added to the meat for a slight variation.

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and cut into very thin rings_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 bay leaves_

_1 cinnamon stick, 3 inches long_

_6 whole cloves_

_2 medium-sized onions, finely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, finely chopped_

_5 cloves garlic, minced_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 tablespoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_2 tablespoons tomato sauce (homemade or canned)_

_2 pounds ground chuck (or ground lamb)_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne (optional)_

Halve the onion rings and separate. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the halved onion rings and fry them for about 5 minutes until they are dark brown but not burned. Remove with a slotted spoon and spread on paper towels. They will not be needed until the meat is almost cooked.

Put the bay leaves, cinnamon, and cloves in the hot oil. When the bay leaves begin to darken and the cinnamon starts uncurling slightly, add the finely chopped onions, ginger, and garlic. Fry, stirring, for 10 to 12 minutes, until the onions darken to a medium brown with darkish edges. Lower flame a bit and add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric. Fry for about 2 minutes, stirring all the time. Add the yogurt and cook, stirring, another minute. Now put in the tomato sauce, and keep frying and stirring for 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the meat. Raise the flame to medium (medium high if the meat is very watery) and fry, breaking up all the lumps with the back of a slotted spoon, for about 7 or 8 minutes. Next, put in the mace, nutmeg, salt, cayenne, and ½ cup water, and stir. Bring to a boil, cover, turn flame down to low, and let it simmer for 1 hour. Stir every 10 minutes or so. After an hour, mix in the browned onion half-rings and remove the cinnamon.

To serve: Serve with Rice with Spinach, Potatoes with Asafetida and Cumin, Green Beans with Ginger, or Yogurt with Tiny Dumplings. Or serve with plain boiled rice, _moong dal_ , and a cauliflower dish. This _kheema_ is also excellent served with _chapatis_ and _pooris_ instead of rice.

## _Kheema with fried onions and peas_

SERVES 6

Follow the preceding recipe. Instead of cooking the chopped meat for 1 hour, cook it for 50 minutes. Add 1 cup freshly shelled (or frozen) peas to it, mix, cover, and let cook another 5 to 10 minutes or until peas are tender. Add the fried onion half-rings and serve as in the previous recipe.

## _Kheema used as stuffing_

Ground meat, _kheema_ , is used very often as stuffing for vegetables. If the _kheema_ is cooked well, and the sauce used over the vegetable is flavorful, these dishes can be superb. Sometimes, when serving four people, I have bought two large eggplants, stuffed them, and brought them to the table covered with a red tomato and tamarind chutney. They have created a sensation.

The vegetables easiest to stuff are green bell peppers, long Italian peppers, tomatoes, and, of course, eggplant. (The discarded inside of the eggplant can be used for an unsmoked version of Eggplant Bharta.) These vegetables come in different sizes, so it will be up to you to decide how many you need. Pick your vegetables of a uniform size.

For the stuffing I use _Kheema_ with Fried Onions. You can use any _kheema_ leftovers as well. The stuffing can, if necessary, be made the day before and refrigerated. You could also make the chutney a night before and store it in a closed jar in the refrigerator. It will keep well.

TO STUFF GREEN BELL PEPPERS AND LONG ITALIAN PEPPERS

Preheat oven to 350° F.

Wash the peppers, then with a small sharp pointed knife cut a small cap around the stem of each pepper. Pull off the cap by the stem. Scoop out and discard the seeds inside the pepper and cut off seeds attached to the cap. Be sure to keep track of which cap belongs to which pepper.

Using a teaspoon, stuff each pepper with the prepared _kheema_ and stick the cap back on. Lay or stand the peppers in one layer in an ovenproof baking dish. Pour Tomato Tamarind Chutney over them, reserving a little chutney to pour over peppers just before you serve them. Cover the baking dish with a lid or aluminum foil, making sure it is tightly covered.

Bake in the preheated oven 45 to 55 minutes, or until peppers are tender.

To serve: Transfer peppers and chutney onto warm serving platter and spoon fresh chutney over them. Serve with _Sookhe Aloo_ , Cucumber _Raita_ , and _parathas_. Or you could serve with rice, a chicken or shrimp dish, a vegetable, and a salad type of relish, e.g., Cucumber and Tomato with Lemon Juice. Or serve the peppers alone as an appetizer.

TO STUFF TOMATOES

Preheat oven to 400° F.

Wash the tomatoes, then with a small sharp pointed knife cut a cap off at the stem end of each tomato. Reserve the caps. Remove the seeds and pulp from each tomato. (A grapefruit knife or serrated spoon is useful for this.)

Using a teaspoon, stuff each tomato with the prepared _kheema_. Replace the caps.

Stand the tomatoes in a single layer in an ovenproof baking dish. Pour Tomato Tamarind Chutney over them, reserving a little chutney to pour over tomatoes just before you serve them. Cover the baking dish tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.

Place in preheated oven, and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until tomatoes wrinkle slightly.

To serve: Lift the tomatoes gently with large kitchen spoon and place on serving platter. Pour extra chutney over them, and serve as an appetizer or as in the preceding recipe for stuffed peppers.

TO STUFF EGGPLANT

Pick medium or large eggplants. Wash them.

Bring water to which 1 teaspoon of salt has been added to boil in a pot large enough to hold the eggplants. Since the eggplants will float, you can half-fill the pot with water. When the water comes to a boil, put in the eggplants and boil 15 minutes. Turn them over halfway through boiling time.

Preheat oven to 350° F.

Pour water carefully out of the pot, so as not to bruise the eggplants, and leave them to cool. Prepare each eggplant this way: when it is cool, cut off a cap at the stem area, and reserve. Now scoop out the inside, leaving only ½ inch of flesh all around. This is not easy. Use a grapefruit knife, a long sharp knife, spoons, a spoon handle—anything that will help you gouge out the inside—holding the eggplant carefully so you don't break the skin. (If you begin to despair, cut the eggplant in half lengthwise and scoop out the inside, leaving ½ inch around the skin, then proceed with the recipe.) When the pulp is out, the eggplant will shrink into itself and look like a very sad sack. Fatten it back into shape by stuffing it with lots of _kheema_. If it is still whole, put its cap on, pour Tomato Tamarind Chutney over it, and bake, covered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the eggplant is tender. Turn over once halfway during baking time. (If you had to halve the eggplants and stuff them that way, place snugly, skin side down, in a baking dish.)

Follow serving directions for stuffed peppers.

## _Koftas (Indian meatballs)_

SERVES 6–8 MAKES ABOUT 48 MEATBALLS

_Koftas_ take a fairly long time to make, so I suggest that you prepare them a day in advance. They can be covered and left in the refrigerator overnight (they will taste even better) and can be reheated before serving. Take care not to break them while stirring and serving.

FOR THE MEATBALLS

_2 pounds finely ground meat from a leg of lamb, or chuck beef (put meat twice through fine blade of grinder, or ask your butcher to do so)_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_1 tablespoon garam masala_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_½ teaspoon ground cumin_

FOR THE STUFFING

_1–2 fresh hot green chilies (optional), finely chopped_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch square, peeled and minced_

_6 scallions or 1 medium-sized onion, peeled and minced_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

_A dash of salt and freshly ground pepper_

FOR BROWNING THE MEATBALLS

_7 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches long_

_2 dried red peppers (optional)_

_4 whole cardamom pods_

_6 whole black peppercorns_

_4 whole cloves_

FOR THE SAUCE

_Vegetable oil (as needed to make up 5 tablespoons)_

_4 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_6 cloves of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of ginger, 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_2 tablespoons ground coriander_

_2 teaspoons ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 medium-sized canned tomatoes, drained and chopped_

_1 tablespoon paprika_

_1 tablespoon garam masala_

_1 teaspoon salt_

GARNISH

_1 tablespoon chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 onion, peeled andfried in rings_

_¼ teaspoon freshly groundcardamom seeds_

Mix all the ingredients for meatballs and keep covered in a bowl.

Mix all the ingredients for the stuffing in another bowl.

Preparing the _koftas_ takes a little time, so you might as well make yourself comfortable. If you have a table and chair in your kitchen, sit down there. Otherwise, spread a newspaper on any handy table and pull up a chair. Place before you the bowls of ground meat and stuffing, a platter with a cover, and a bowl of warm water.

Two pounds of meat will make about 48 _koftas_ about 1 to 1½ inches in diameter. To simplify, portion the meat into 8 equal sections and then make 6 _koftas_ out of each section.

Pick up enough meat for one _kofta_ and form into a rough ball. Depress the ball and place a generous pinch of stuffing in its center. Cover the stuffing by bringing around the meat from the outer edges and making it into a ball again. Smooth out the ball by moistening your palms and fingertips slightly and by working it in your hand. As each ball is made, place it on the platter and cover. Continue this way until you have used up all the meat and stuffing.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat, and put in the cinnamon, red peppers, cardamom pods, peppercorns, and cloves. Stir once. In 10 seconds or so when the cloves begin to expand and the red pepper swells and turns dark, add the meatballs, just enough of them so they don't overcrowd the skillet. Brown them on all sides, remove with slotted spoon, and return to platter. (Remember, you are just browning the _koftas_ , not cooking them through.) When all the _koftas_ are browned, cover the platter and set aside.

The last step is making the sauce: Lift out the whole spices from the oil used for browning the _koftas_ and place them with the _koftas_. Pour the oil into a very large and wide heavy-bottomed pot. Add more oil, if needed, to make 5 tablespoons.

Place the chopped onions, garlic, and ginger in a blender with 4 tablespoons water and blend at high speed until it becomes a smooth paste.

Heat the oil, then pour in the paste from the blender. Fry over medium heat for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid has evaporated, stirring frequently. Add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric, and keep frying another 5 minutes. If the spices stick at the bottom of the pan, add 1 teaspoon of warm water at a time and keep stirring. (Never put too much water in. The idea is to fry the spices and onion, not to boil them.)

Add the chopped tomatoes, and continue to stir and fry 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water, cover pan, and let the tomatoes simmer 3 to 5 minutes, lifting the cover two or three times to make sure they are not burning. Remove cover, stir again, and fry for 1 more minute.

Now add l½ cups water, the _koftas_ , the spices used in frying meatballs, the paprika, the _garam masala_ , and the teaspoon of salt. Mix gently, and bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer slowly for half an hour.

To serve: Gently spoon out the _koftas_ into a heated serving dish, taking care not to break them. Stir the sauce and pour it over them.

Sprinkle the parsley and onion and cardamom on top. This dish can be served with plain boiled rice, _moong dal_ , and a cucumber and tomato salad, at its simplest. (As a child I used to love this combination. On Sundays, we very often substituted _Karhi_ for the _dal.)_ At a banquet, you could garnish it with _vark_ and serve it with Chicken _Biryani_ , Carrots and Peas with Ginger and Chinese Parsley, and Yogurt with Spinach.

At picnics, it goes well with stale _pooris_ or _parathas_ and pickles.

Made a little smaller, the _koftas_ can be served with drinks.

Warn diners not to eat the whole spices, but to leave them delicately at one side of their plate!

## _Nargisi koftas (large meatballs stuffed with hard-boiled eggs)_

SERVES 4

_Koftas_ , as you know by now, are meatballs. _Nargis_ is the Indian word for the narcissus flower. Why these particular meatballs are considered narcissuslike, I am not too sure. I can only guess that when cut in half (they are nearly always served that way) these egg-filled _koftas_ remind some people of the yellow and white spring flower.

_Nargisi koftas_ are definitely not an everyday dish in India. It may be _my_ particular experience, but I have eaten them only at weddings and banquets. You, of course, need not limit yourself this way! They are not difficult to make, look beautiful, and taste quite marvelous. They are actually meatballs stuffed with whole hard-boiled eggs and cooked in a thick sauce.

_1¼ pounds ground chuck (put through the grinder 3 times)_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_⅛ teaspoon ground mace_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_1½ teaspoons ground cumin_

_1½ teaspoons salt (or a little more if needed)_

_8 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_3 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 medium-sized eggs, hard-boiled and peeled_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_6 lightly crushed cardamom pods_

_2 bay leaves_

_2 whole dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon paprika (for color)_

_2 tablespoons tomato sauce_

If your butcher has not ground the meat 3 times, do it yourself at home. It should be _very_ finely ground.

In a large bowl combine the meat, cloves, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, mace, black pepper, ½ teaspoon of the cumin, 1 teaspoon of the salt, 2 tablespoons of the yogurt, and the chopped Chinese parsley. Mix well, cover bowl, and leave aside.

Place onion, garlic, and ginger in container of an electric blender with 6 tablespoons water and blend to a smooth paste.

Divide the ground meat into 4 portions. Wrap one portion around each peeled hard-boiled egg, covering it well.

Heat the vegetable oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over a medium-high flame, and put in the cardamom pods and bay leaves, and the red peppers if you want them. The spices will darken in a few seconds. Now put in the four meatballs and brown them all over. Turn them carefully so as not to break them. They will brown unevenly, but don't let that worry you. When they have browned, lift them out gently with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.

To the same oil, add the paste from the blender container, keeping face averted, and fry, stirring, for about 10 minutes.

Now turn the flame to medium and add the coriander, the remaining 1 teaspoon cumin, and the turmeric. Keep frying and stirring for a minute. Add 1 tablespoon yogurt and stir for ½ minute. Add another tablespoon yogurt and stir for ½ minute. Repeat this process until all the yogurt has been added. Now put in the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, the paprika, the tomato sauce, and ¾ cup water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes.

Lift up lid and add the _koftas_. Cover and simmer gently for ½ hour. Turn the _koftas_ every 7 or 8 minutes and spoon sauce over them.

To serve: Cut _koftas_ in half and place on a warm platter. Spoon sauce over them and serve with almost any rice dish or with hot _chapatis_. Any yogurt _raita_ and a pea or green bean dish would also go well with them,

## _Cubed lamb with onions and raisins_

SERVES 6–8

This dish is an adaptation I have made from _mullah do pyaza_ , a Moghul favorite in which the meat is served with a lot of fried onions. These onions are cooked separately but are added to the meat for the last 5 minutes of cooking time. I brown the lamb pieces before I cook them, because, as I explained earlier, the meat in America seems to have a very high water content and will not brown with the spices, as it does in India. The raisins I add are optional. You could omit them if you do not like raisins or add more if you really like them.

_3 pounds boneless meat from shoulder of lamb (stewing beef may be substituted)_

_11 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_10 medium-sized onions_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_2 teaspoons ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_3 heaping tablespoons plain yogurt_

_2 tablespoons canned tomato sauce_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_½ teaspoon ground cloves_

_½ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_2 tablespoons golden seedless raisins_

Trim fat off the cubes of lamb. Pat dry with paper towels.

Heat 5 tablespoons of oil in a large-bottomed pot. When oil is very hot, fry 7 or 8 pieces of meat at a time, browning well on all sides, and then remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl. When all the meat has browned, turn off the heat.

Peel and coarsely chop 2 of the onions and place them with the garlic, ginger, and 5 tablespoons of water in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Turn on the heat to medium under the pot in which you browned the meat. Pour in the paste from the blender and fry, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes. Add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric, and fry, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the yogurt, a tablespoon at a time, and keep stirring and frying. Then add the tomato sauce, a tablespoon at a time, and keep stirring. (In all, this should take about 10 minutes.) If after you have added the tomato sauce some sticks to the bottom of your pot, add warm water, a teaspoon at a time, scraping the bottom and continuing to cook. The paste should turn a rich brown color.

Put in the browned pieces of lamb along with any liquid that has accumulated, 1 cup of water, the salt, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne (if desired), and black pepper. Mix well. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and allow to simmer gently for 1 hour. (The beef should cook for 2½ hours.)

Meanwhile peel the other 8 onions, cut them in half lengthwise, and slice them into half-rings ⅛ inch thick.

Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in each of two skillets over medium heat. (It is quicker and easier to use two skillets, frying half the onions in each simultaneously. You can also do them in two batches.) When the oil is hot, fry the onion slices 10 to 12 minutes, until they are browned but not crisp. If the lamb has cooked 55 minutes to an hour by this time, remove onions with a slotted spoon and add them to the meat. If not, remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl and set aside. Turn off the heat under one skillet. Into the other put the raisins and fry for a few seconds until they turn brown and puff up, then add to the meat pot if the meat is done or hold in the bowl with the fried onions. Once the onions and raisins have been added to the meat, simmer for 5 minutes.

To serve: Serve with _pooris_ or _chapatis_ , a yogurt dish, a relish—Sweet Tomato Chutney or Cucumber and Tomato with Lemon Juice—and a vegetable: cabbage or cauliflower would be good. Almost any plain rice or vegetable and rice dish can be served with it as well. I often serve it with Rice with Whole Spices and _Karhi_.

## _Lamb with onions and mushrooms, or lamb do pyaza_

SERVES 4–6

Any meat _do pyaza_ usually means meat cooked with an equal weight of fried onions, _pyaz_ being the North Indian word for onions. I have modified the traditional recipe slightly by adding mushrooms and by cooking with fenugreek, fennel, and onion seeds instead of the more commonly used cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, and cinnamon.

This is a mild-tasting dish, relatively easy to make and very popular with both children and adults.

_2 pounds boned meat from shoulder of lamb, trimmed of excess fat, and cut into 1-inch cubes_

_5 medium-sized onions_

_Vegetable oil (enough for ⅛ inch in bottom of skillet)_

_¼ teaspoon whole black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_½ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_15 fenugreek seeds_

_½ cup plain yogurt_

_1 teaspoon salt (more if needed)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_½ pound fresh mushrooms_

Dry the meat thoroughly with paper towels and leave at room temperature while preparing the other ingredients.

Peel and halve the onions lengthwise. Slice them into ⅛-inch-thick half-rings. In a 12-inch skillet, heat the oil. Fry the onions over a high flame 8 to 10 minutes, until they turn dark brown in spots and soften. Stir as you do this.

Remove onions with a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl or dish.

In the same skillet put the onion seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and fenugreek seeds. Within a few seconds the fennel seeds will begin to darken. As soon as this happens, put in the cubes of meat and fry 5 to 10 minutes until well browned on all sides. While the meat is browning, put the yogurt in a bowl. Add ½ cup water to it very gradually, a tablespoon at a time, beating with a fork. Once the meat has browned, beat the yogurt mixture again and pour it into the skillet. Add salt, pepper, and cayenne, bring to a boil, cover, lower heat to medium low, and cook for 25 minutes. Clean the mushrooms. Cut off the hard ends of the stems. If the mushrooms are largish, quarter them whole (stem and all); if they are of medium size, halve them; if they are of button size, leave them whole. After the meat has cooked 25 minutes, add the mushrooms. Stir well. Cover again and cook another 25 minutes or until meat is tender.

Lift off the cover and add the fried onions. Raise heat to medium high and boil away most of the liquid. (The only "sauce" should be what clings to the meat. At the bottom of the pan you should see just the fat.) This should take 5 minutes or less. Check the salt.

To serve: Here is an Indian dish that can be served as part of a traditional Indian dinner or as the main course of a Western-style meal.

At an Indian meal, you could serve it as we did very often on Sundays—with plain rice, _Karhi_ , green beans, and Tomato and Onion with Lemon Juice.

I serve it often to my family with Rice and Peas and a fresh green salad.

## _Lamb korma_

SERVES 6–8

_3 tablespoons ground coriander_

_1 tablespoon ground cumin_

_1 tablespoon desiccated unsweetened coconut_

_4 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of ginger, about 1½ inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 large canned tomato or 2 small ones, coarsely chopped_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_5 whole cardamom pods_

_6 whole cloves_

_7 whole black peppercorns_

_2 bay leaves_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches long_

_2 or more dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_3 pounds boneless meat from lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes (or shank, neck, or leg—seeproportions), thoroughly dried_

_1 tablespoon plain yogurt_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

GARNISH

_Fried onion rings_

_¼ teaspoon freshly groundcardamom seeds_

_Sliced hot green chilies_

_Chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

Heat a small iron skillet or griddle over medium flame, and dry-roast the coriander, cumin, and coconut, tossing them around with a spoon. Roast for 2 to 3 minutes until the spices turn dark brown, and set aside. Remove skillet from heat. Place onions, garlic, and ginger in blender with tomato and turmeric. Blend at high speed for 1 minute or until you have a smooth paste, and set aside.

In a large heavy-bottomed pot heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium flame. When hot, add the cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, cinnamon, and red peppers. Stir. As soon as the peppercorns begin to expand and the red peppers turn dark, put in a few pieces of meat at a time. Turn the flame higher and brown the meat on all sides. As each batch browns, remove it to a side plate. When all the lamb is browned, cover it and set it aside. Remove the whole spices from the pot with a slotted spoon and keep with lamb.

To make the sauce: Keep flame on medium high, and add 2 tablespoons of oil to what is left in the pot. While it is heating, add the paste from the blender, keeping face averted. Stir from time to time. As the water evaporates and the paste starts to stick to the bottom, lower heat and stir continuously, for about 5 minutes in all, sprinkling in a little water now and then to prevent scorching. Add the roasted spices and cook for another 5 minutes, then stir in the yogurt, a little at a time, to prevent scorching.

Now put in the meat, the salt, and enough water to barely cover the lamb. Bring to boil, cover, and simmer about 1 hour or until done. Lift cover. Sprinkle in 1 teaspoon _garam masala_ , and cook, stirring, for another 5 minutes.

To serve: Spoon out into serving dish and garnish with one or all of the items suggested. Serve with boiled rice, _pooris_ or _chapatis_ , and okra or cauliflower or Eggplant _Bharta_. This dish is also good served with sweet rice, a yogurt dish, and Sweet Tomato Chutney.

## _Lamb (or beef) korma with almonds, pecans, and sour cream_

SERVES 4–6

This dish can be made with shoulder or leg of lamb or stewing beef. Stewing beef generally takes much longer to cook, so adjust your time accordingly.

_5 medium-sized onions_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_Vegetable oil, enough to have 1⁄16 inch in skillet_

_2 pounds boned meat from shoulder of lamb, trimmed of excess fat, and cut into 1–1½-inch cubes_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_2 teaspoons ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_3 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_1 teaspoon salt (or as desired)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_10 pecan halves_

_¼ cup blanched almonds_

_2 tablespoons sour cream_

GARNISH

_5 cardamom pods_

_2 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_The fried onions_

Peel the onions. Cut 4 of them into halves lengthwise, and then slice them into very thin half-rings.

Chop the fifth onion coarsely. Put it along with the garlic and ginger in the container of an electric blender. Add 4 tablespoons of water and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat oil in a 10–12-inch skillet (use a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet with lid or a wide casserole-type dish) over medium-high heat. Put in the sliced onions and fry, stirring, for 15 to 20 minutes or until they are dark brown and crisp, not black and burned. Remove them with a slotted spoon and spread on paper towels to drain. (You will not need them until serving time.)

Dry the pieces of meat thoroughly and brown them well, about 8 pieces at a time, in the onion-flavored oil. As each batch gets done, remove with slotted spoon to a platter. When all the meat is browned, turn off the heat.

When the skillet has cooled a bit, pour in the paste from the electric blender. Stir it well, mixing it with the coagulated pan juices. Turn the heat on medium high and fry the paste, stirring all the time, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it has browned. Now lower heat and add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric. Mix and fry, stirring, for a minute or two. Add the tomato sauce and fry another minute.

Next add the mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix and cook slowly for 5 minutes. Stir every now and then.

Now add ½ cup water, the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and browned meat, as well as the juices that have accumulated. Bring to a boil. Cover. Lower heat and simmer gently for 30 minutes.

If you want to remove the fat, skim it off as it rises to the top.

Put the pecans and almonds in a blender with 3 tablespoons of water, and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste. You may need to stop and push down with a rubber spatula a few times.

Add the nut paste, then the sour cream, to the meat. Stir and check the salt. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 25 to 30 minutes or until meat is tender.

Peel the cardamoms, discarding the skin. Crush the seeds with a heavy mortar and pestle or put them through a clean pepper grinder.

To serve: Place the meat and gravy in a wide bowl. Garnish with ground cardamom seeds, chopped Chinese parsley, and the fried onions. Serve with hot _chapatis_ or _parathas_ , or almost any rice dish. Cabbage, green beans, and carrot dishes would go well with this _korma_. For a relish, choose something with raw onions and tomato.

## _Lamb cooked in dark almond sauce (badami roghan josh)_

SERVES 4–6

_Roghan josh_ is a traditional North Indian Muslim dish. It has a thick dark nutty sauce made with almonds and roasted cumin, coriander, and coconut. Even though shoulder of lamb is used here, you could use leg, neck, or shank. Stewing beef may also be substituted.

_2 pounds boned meat from shoulder of lamb, cubed into 1-inch pieces_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_10 whole cloves_

_1–2 whole dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_12 peppercorns_

_6 whole cardamom pods_

_1 tablespoon ground cumin_

_2 tablespoons ground coriander_

_1 tablespoon desiccated unsweetened coconut_

_3 tablespoons blanched almonds, coarsely chopped_

_6 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and finely minced_

_3 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_½ cup tomato sauce_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

Wipe the meat well with paper towels.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet. When the oil is hot, add the cloves, red peppers, peppercorns, and cardamom. Stir them for a few seconds until they puff up and darken.

Now put in 7 or 8 pieces of meat at a time to brown. When each lot is brown on all sides, remove with a slotted spoon to a large flameproof covered casserole, taking care to leave the spices in the skillet. Continue to brown all the meat this way and set aside. Turn off flame under skillet.

You have to roast some spices now, so take out your heaviest iron-type skillet (I keep a small one just for this purpose). Put the cumin, coriander, coconut, and almonds in it. Turn heat on medium and roast, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until spices turn a coffee color. Turn off heat and pour roasted spices and nuts into container of electric blender. Add chopped garlic and ginger.

With a slotted spoon, lift out the fried spices in the oil and put them in the blender container too. Add the turmeric, nutmeg, mace, and 8 tablespoons water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth, thick paste. You may need to stop the blender and push down with a rubber spatula.

In the same skillet in which the lamb cooked, fry the onions over high heat, stirring and scraping up the juices for about 5 minutes, or until they turn dark in spots. Then lower heat to medium and add paste from blender. Stir and fry for another 5 minutes, gradually adding the yogurt, a tablespoon at a time.

Now add the tomato sauce and ½ cup water. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 15 minutes.

Put the meat into this sauce. Add the salt and stir. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 1 hour. Stir a few times at it cooks.

To serve: Place in a warm dish, cover, and take to the table. _Roghan josh_ goes very well with _pooris_ or _chapatis_ and Rice with Peas or Rice with Spinach. Serve a yogurt dish with it, and cauliflower, or carrots.

## _Lamb with vinegar and mint_

SERVES 4–6

This is a very refreshing way of cooking lamb. I like to make this dish fairly hot, but you could use fewer red peppers or none at all, as you prefer. Fresh mint is available all year round in specialty stores, but since this dish requires a whole bunch of mint, it would certainly be cheaper if you cooked it in the summer months. As a substitute, you could use dried mint flakes, but I find all dried herbs seem impregnated with a rather undesirable musty flavor.

There are three ways you could serve this meat. You could dish it out with all its sauce—in which case you should serve the meat either on rice, to soak up the sauce—or in a little bowl, like a stew, set on the dinner plate. Or you could use the last 5 minutes of cooking time to reduce the sauce by about half by cooking it uncovered over a high flame—you will then be left with a thick sauce which can be served directly on the plates with the meat. The third alternative is to use the last 10 minutes of the cooking time to dry up almost _all_ the sauce and serve the meat as a "dry" dish. The recipe given here is for the "dry dish," which I happen to prefer.

_2 pounds boneless meat from shoulder of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes (or shank, neck, or leg—seeproportions)_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1½ tablespoons ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground cloves_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon dry English mustard_

_1–2 whole dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_6 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 tablespoons red wine vinegar_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and minced_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_4 tablespoons well-packed finely minced fresh mint, or 1 tablespoon dried mint plus 2 tablespoons trimmed, chopped parsley_

Wipe lamb cubes well.

Put oil in a 10–12 inch skillet and turn the flame on high. When hot, put in 7 or 8 cubes of meat at a time and brown them on all sides. As each lot gets browned, remove it with a slotted spoon to a heavy-bottomed pot and cover. Brown all the cubes of meat this way. Turn flame off under skillet and set aside to use later.

Put the cumin, cloves, cinnamon, turmeric, and mustard powder, as well as the 2 (or less) red peppers and the chopped garlic and ginger, into the container of an electric blender. Add the vinegar and blend at high speed, until you have a smooth paste.

Put the minced onions in the skillet in which you browned the meat. Turn the heat to high and fry the onions for 5 minutes, scraping up the meat juices in skillet as you do so. The onions must turn brown in spots. Turn heat down to medium and pour in the thick blended paste. Stir and fry for 5 minutes, adding a teaspoon of water every minute.

Now put in a cup of water and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 10 minutes.

When the sauce has cooked, pour it over the meat. Add the salt and mint, bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 45 minutes.

Remove the cover and raise the flame to high. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes until the sauce is almost dried up, leaving only a few tablespoons in the pot and what is coating the meat. You will need to lower the heat the last few minutes so that the sauce does not stick.

To serve: Serve with _pooris_ , a potato dish, and a green vegetable dish. You could also serve it with a rice dish and a green vegetable. As part of a Western-style meal, serve it with wild rice and a green salad.

## _Lamb with spinach_

SERVES 6–8

This is a traditional Moghul recipe. I use lamb for the recipe, but you could use beef (chuck or round) if you like.

_3 pounds fresh spinach (or four 10-ounce packages of frozen spinach)_

_3 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_7–8 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 fresh hot green chili, chopped (optional), or ⅛–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_3 pounds boneless meat from shoulder of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes (or shank, neck, or leg—seeproportions)_

_1 cinnamon stick, 3 inches long_

_1 whole cloves_

_7 whole cardamom pods_

_2 bay leaves_

_2 tablespoons ground coriander_

_1 tablespoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 medium-sized canned tomato, chopped_

_2 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_1 tablespoon garam masala_

In a large pot, bring about 5 quarts of water to boil.

Meanwhile, trim and wash the fresh spinach thoroughly in cold water. Make sure you get all the sand out.

Drop the spinach in the boiling water, a pound batch at a time, and let it boil until the leaves wilt. You may need to push it down occasionally. As each batch wilts, scoop it out into a colander and run cold water over it. (If you are using frozen spinach, cook according to directions and drain.) When all the spinach is done, squeeze out most of the water and mince it. Keep aside in bowl.

Place the chopped onions, chopped ginger, garlic, green chili, and 5 tablespoons of water in the blender container and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste (about 1 minute).

Heat the oil in a 4-5-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Pat dry the cubes of meat thoroughly on paper towels. Put 7 or 8 pieces at a time into the hot oil and brown them on all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Put the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, and bay leaves in the same hot oil. Stir. When the bay leaves begin to darken (10 to 20 seconds), add the paste from the blender (keep face averted). Keep stirring and frying for 10 minutes until the mixture darkens (if it sticks to the bottom, sprinkle a teaspoon of water at a time, and keep frying).

Now lower the flame and, continuing to stir and fry constantly, add at intervals first the coriander, cumin, and turmeric, 2 minutes later the chopped tomato, then about 5 minutes later the yogurt, and finally 2 minutes later the browned meat cubes. When meat and spices are well mixed put in the spinach. Add salt, bring to a boil, then cover and lower the heat to allow the mixture to simmer gently for 50 minutes. (Most meat gives out enough water for it to cook in its own juice, as it were. If you find that the meat is sticking, you can add up to ½ cup of warm water.) Stir occasionally as it cooks.

At the end of the cooking time, uncover, increase heat, and cook rapidly until most of the liquid evaporates, leaving a thick sauce. Put in the _garam masala_ and stir gently, being careful not to break meat pieces.

To serve: Place in warm dish and serve with _chapatis_ , Potatoes with Asafetida and Cumin and Yogurt with Roasted Eggplant. Or you could serve it with plain boiled rice, any lentils, and a cauliflower dish if you like.

## _Sindhi gosht (Sindhi meat)_

SERVES 6

This is a marvelous dish from Sindh, a state on the western coast of India. I first encountered it at a friend's house in Bombay, and insisted on leaving with the recipe in my pocket.

The meat (lamb) is marinated for 3 to 4 hours in a paste of onions, garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, red pepper, salt, pepper, and vinegar. It is then cooked in this marinade, with the addition of onion and fennel seeds.

_2½ pounds boneless meat from lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes (or shank, neck, or leg—seeproportions)_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, coarsely chopped_

_6 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_2 teaspoons ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_⅛–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional; use desired amount)_

_½ cup red wine vinegar_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds_

_1 teaspoon whole black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

Remove fat and tissue from the cubes of meat.

In the container of an electric blender, place the chopped onions, ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne pepper (if used), vinegar, and salt. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Pour paste into a bowl large enough to contain the meat. Prick the meat with a fork or with the point of a sharp knife and place in marinade. Mix well, cover, and leave for 3 to 4 hours. (Refrigerate if it is a very hot day; otherwise leave at room temperature.)

After the meat has marinated, pour contents of bowl into a wide 4-quart cooking pot. Add the fennel and onion seeds. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer about 1 hour.

Lift off cover. Taste to check the salt (you may want to add a little more). Raise the heat and boil rapidly until most of the liquid evaporates. You will need to stir more frequently as the liquid diminishes. Now add the oil and keep stirring and frying over a medium flame. This dish must be "dry," i.e., a thickish sauce should cling to the meat, which browns as the liquid cooks down. Be careful not to break meat pieces as you stir.

To serve: Place in a warmed dish and serve with _chapatis, parathas_ , or _pooris_. You could also serve it with almost any kind of rice. With it, serve peas, okra, beans, or cabbage, and some yogurt dish, perhaps Yogurt with Potatoes.

## _Lamb chops with whole spices and yogurt_

SERVES 4

In this dish, lamb chops are cooked with whole spices, garlic, ginger, Chinese parsley, and yogurt. It is simple to make and very delicious in its final blend of flavors.

_8 lamb chops_

_4 heaping tablespoons plain yogurt_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_10 whole black peppercorns_

_10 whole cloves_

_2 bay leaves_

_8 cardamom pods_

_2 cinnamon sticks, 2 inches long_

_2 whole dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and minced_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_4 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro), or use fresh mint, watercress, or regular parsley as a substitute_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Trim lamb chops of excess fat, leaving ⅛ inch along the sides. Pat dry with paper towels.

Mix the yogurt with 1 cup of water and set aside in a nonmetallic bowl.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch heavy-bottomed pot. When oil is very hot, put in 4 chops at a time, brown well on both sides, and remove with slotted spoon. Turn heat down to medium and fry the whole spices (peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, and red peppers) for about 20 seconds or until the bay leaves turn darker. Now add minced ginger and garlic, and fry, stirring, for a minute. Add the parsley and keep stirring for another minute.

Now put lamb chops back into the pot along with any liquid that may have collected in the bowl. Stir the yogurt water once again and pour over chops. Add salt, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer one hour. Stir gently every 10 minutes.

To serve: Serve with Rice with Peas, Cucumber _Raita_ , and any of the green bean recipes. Or serve with plain boiled potatoes and a green salad.

## _Pork chops cooked with whole spices and tamarind juice_

SERVES 4

Indians sometimes use Western cuts of meat to cook local dishes. We did not eat pork very often in our home, but every now and then my father would drive down to a special butcher to buy pork chops. Here is one of the ways we ate them.

_1 tamarind lump about the size of a walnut_

_8 loin or rib pork chops_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_12 whole black peppercorns_

_10 whole cloves_

_2 cinnamon sticks, each 2½ inches long_

_8 whole cardamom pods_

_2 cloves of garlic, peeled_

_2 whole dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_1 teaspoon granulated sugar_

Soak the tamarind lump in ¾ cup hot water for at least 2 hours.

Pat dry the eight pork chops with paper towels. Trim off all but ⅛ inch fat along the sides.

Heat oil in a 10–12-inch heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. When oil is very hot, put in 4 pork chops at a time and brown them on both sides. This should take 3 to 4 minutes on each side.

Once the pork chops have browned, remove them to a side dish and keep covered. Lower flame to medium.

In the same oil place first the peppercorns, then the cloves, the cinnamon, the cardamom pods, the garlic, and finally the red pepper. Stir and fry these ingredients for about a minute or less until the red peppers darken and the garlic is a bit browned.

Now return the pork chops to the skillet and add 1 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and allow to cook very gently for ½ hour. Turn the chops over a few times as they cook.

Meanwhile, press the tamarind juice and pulp through a strainer into a nonmetallic bowl. Discard tamarind fibers, skins, seeds, etc.

When the pork chops have cooked for 30 minutes, add 2 tablespoons tamarind juice, 1 teaspoon sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt. Mix well, turning the chops. Cover and keep cooking slowly another 15 to 20 minutes. By this time most of the liquid will have been absorbed, leaving just the fat behind.

To serve: In India, the fat and the spices would be served with the meat. Here, in America, I suggest you lift the chops from the pot with a slotted spoon, leaving all the oil and spices behind. Place on a warm platter and serve with Rice with Peas or any other vegetable rice dish. You could also serve it with _Sookhe Aloo_ ("Dry" Potatoes) instead. For a vegetable, the Cabbage with Onions would be a good idea. If you are not up to cooking a complicated vegetable dish (as I am sometimes not), serve just a salad, or sliced tomatoes.

## _Pork chops cooked with cabbage_

SERVES 4

This is another recipe for pork chops which is relatively simple and quite delicious. The chops and cabbage are cooked separately first and then combined to cook together for the last 10 minutes. At home we considered this a "Western" dish and ate it with mashed or boiled potatoes. The combination of spices used is actually very Indian, even though the dish does lend itself to being served in a Western style.

_1 medium-sized cabbage (2½ pounds orso)_

_1 medium-sized onion_

_8 pork chops (loin or rib)_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 bay leaves_

_2 cinnamon sticks, each 2½ inches long_

_8 cardamom pods_

_10 whole cloves_

_12 whole black peppercorns_

_2 dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_1 teaspoon sugar_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_3 heaping tablespoons plain yogurt_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Remove outer leaves of cabbage. Wash, quarter, remove core, and shred cabbage into long, fine slices.

Peel onion, cut into half lengthwise, and slice into thin half-rings.

Wipe the pork chops dry and trim away all the fat except about ⅛ inch along the sides.

Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 10–12-inch heavy-bottomed pot over a medium-high flame. When oil is hot, put in 4 chops at a time and brown them well on both sides. This will take 3 to 4 minutes on each side. When all the chops have been browned, remove them to a plate or bowl.

In the same skillet, over medium-high heat, fry the bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom pods, cloves, peppercorns, and whole red peppers for about a minute or until red peppers darken. Now add 1 cup water, the pork chops, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Bring to a boil, cover, turn down flame to very low, and simmer gently for about 35 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a large wide pot over medium-high heat. When hot, put in the cumin seed. When the cumin seed darkens—in about 20 seconds—add the sliced onion and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring all the time. Turn the heat to medium and add the cabbage. Fry, stirring for a minute. Cover, lower flame, and allow cabbage to steam in its own liquid for 5 minutes.

Uncover and raise flame again to medium. Add ½ teaspoon salt. Now fry, stirring, for about 20 minutes until the cabbage is slightly browned. Turn off flame.

Put the yogurt in a cup and add enough cold water to make ½ cup. Mix well.

When the pork chops have cooked about 35 minutes, uncover and add the cabbage, the yogurt mixture, and the lemon juice. Mix well, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes.

To serve: Arrange pork chops and cabbage on a warm platter and serve with boiled or mashed potatoes. Some of my friends like to serve a spiced apple ring or other fruit relish with this dish.

## _Pork chops à la Jaffrey_

SERVES 2

I apologize for this name. The dish is really my very own concoction and unlikely to be served in any Indian home other than mine. Indians almost never use celery in their cooking. Nor do they often use soy sauce, though I must say that in the major cities the influence of an overcooked version of Chinese cuisine is certainly making itself felt. This recipe acknowledges its debt to that cuisine, but tastes, in the last analysis, rather Indian. The dish is simple to make and quite delicious. The recipe here serves 2 people (2 chops each). If you wish to serve 4, just double the ingredients.

_4 pork chops (loin or rib)_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 bay leaves_

_1 hot dried red pepper (optional)_

_8 whole cloves_

_1 large celery rib, diced_

_1 medium-sized onion, coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and ½ inch wide, sliced into 3 rounds_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled_

_⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_⅛ teaspoon ground mace_

_3 tablespoons soy sauce_

_1½ teaspoons granulated sugar_

_½ lemon_

Try to get pork chops that are evenly cut, so that they may brown evenly. Pat the chops dry and trim all but ¼ inch of the fat. Place them in a large skillet and turn heat on high. The chops should brown in their own fat. When they are a golden color on both sides (press down areas that refuse to touch the skillet), remove them from skillet and place in bowl or plate. Turn off the heat and pour off only the accumulated fat in the skillet.

Heat the vegetable oil along with the coagulated juices in the same skillet over a medium flame, and put in the bay leaves, red pepper, and cloves. Stir. When the bay leaves change color (this should take a few seconds) add celery, onions, ginger, and garlic. Stirring, fry over medium flame for 4 to 5 minutes or until everything is slightly browned. Add the browned pork chops, cinnamon, mace, soy sauce, sugar, and ¼ cup water. Cut the lemon into 4 round slices (skin and all—remove pits though) and place over chops. Bring to boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently 50 minutes to 1 hour or until tender. Turn and mix gently every 10 to 15 minutes.

To serve: Place contents of skillet on platter and serve with Plain _Basmati_ Rice and a green salad. A yogurt type of relish would be a good side dish. If you like you can remove the pieces of ginger and garlic before you serve.

## _Sweetbreads with Chinese parsley_

SERVES 6

If you like sweetbreads, you will enjoy this dish. I happen to love it, but my children are nearly always reduced to remarks like "1 like it, but I don't want it"—remarks which I counteract by drawing my eyebrows close together and staring at the wall in a hurt kind of way. This induces some polite nibbling which I try to make easier by saying, "It's good for you." My mother did the same kind of thing to me, so I see no reason to break tradition. Here is my recipe for sweetbreads. Try it. It's good for you!

_2 pounds sweetbreads_

_2 medium-sized onions_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2½ inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 hot green chili, finely sliced (more or less as desired), or ⅛–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (as desired)_

_4 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 tablespoons tomato sauce (canned)_

_2 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_1¾ teaspoons salt_

_2 tablespoons white vinegar_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Soak the sweetbreads in ice water for 1 hour.

Meanwhile, peel the onions. Slice one into fine rings and halve the rings. Set aside. Chop the other onion coarsely.

Put the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in container of electric blender, add 3 tablespoons of water, and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste (about 1 minute). Leave in container.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. When hot, put in the halved onion rings and fry them, stirring, for about 5 minutes until they are crisp, dark brown, but not burned. With a slotted spoon, remove them and spread on paper towels.

Pour the paste from blender into the onion-flavored oil. Fry, stirring, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until mixture turns a medium golden brown. Add at intervals, stirring continuously, the green chili (or cayenne) and the parsley; then, after 1 minute, coriander, cumin, turmeric, lowering the flame; after another minute, the tomato sauce; and then the yogurt, continuing to fry and stir, for 2 to 3 minutes; finally ¾ teaspoon salt and 4 tablespoons warm water. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and allow the mixture to simmer for 15 minutes.

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to boil. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the vinegar. Remove the sweetbreads from the ice water and drain. Plunge them into the boiling water, drain, and plunge again into the ice water. Remove connecting tissue carefully (you can almost peel it off) and break sweetbreads into 1–1½-inch pieces.

After the sauce has cooked about 15 minutes, add the sweetbread pieces and lemon juice; stir, cover again, and cook gently for another 15 minutes.

To serve: Place in a warm dish. Sprinkle with the browned onions, and serve with hot _chapatis_ and a vegetable and a yogurt dish of your choice. You could also serve any tomato or onion relish.

 ntil a few years ago there were only two ways one could buy poultry in India. Either you went up to the poultry market where live birds were kept in coops and you selected one, or you would wait at home for the poultry man to come around, hawking his wares. If he was somewhat affluent, he would arrive on a bicycle, but more often than not he came at a half-run, on his own two feet. On his humped shoulders he carried a bamboo, bent by the weight of a large basket dangling at each end. The lower section of these baskets was wicker, while the top was made of a rope mesh which could be opened and closed like an old-fashioned pouch. The occupants of these swaying baskets were the indignant birds—chickens and ducks mostly—which could not be seen except for a head here, a foot there, and a tail sticking out of the rope mesh; but they could be heard from a distance, squawking, quacking, and cackling. One had to know how to pick a bird by feeling its flesh. Experts like my father could even tell the age of the bird by prodding and squeezing in the right places.

In the last few years refrigeration and freezing have increased tremendously. The result is that poultry farms have mushroomed all over the country. The birds are sent, cleaned and plucked, to specialty stores where they can be bought very much as they are in America. Of course, this is true only of the larger cities. The small towns and villages still rely on the old system.

The chickens in India seem to me to have more flavor than chickens here, though they can frequently be fairly tough, requiring a much longer cooking time. The only chicken that can be broiled in India is the l½-2½-pound spring chicken, and even then the bird must first be tenderized in a marinade containing green papaya or yogurt.

The Moghul miniature painters of the seventeenth century often showed royalty at the hunt, the _shikar_. Seated on cushioned, thronelike howdahs atop elephants or camels, they hunted anything from tigers to quail. The _shikar_ still goes on, and although big game is generally left to the very rich, duck, geese, partridge, and quail can still be had by the ordinary Mr. Singh on the street. Many restaurants have partridges on their daily menu, and many homes, like mine, serve roast duck frequently during the winter season.

The chicken available in American markets is so tender that it begins to fall apart well before it can go through the several stages required in most Indian recipes. Very often the chicken is cooked before the spices have permeated the meat. I have tried to adjust the chicken recipes to the tenderness of the American "fryer," the most commonly used chicken.

Most Indian chicken recipes require the removal of the skin before the bird is cooked. My New York butcher shakes his head in despair every time I request this. To spare his feelings, I have now taken to doing the task myself. It is really quite easy and can be accomplished with a sharp, pointed knife and a bit of tugging in certain places.

Also, Indians generally cut their chicken into small pieces but rarely remove the bones. Legs are separated into drumsticks and thighs, breasts are cut into four or six pieces, backs into two or three, and wings into two. The reason is to allow the spices to penetrate the meat and bones as much as possible. I often serve just legs and breasts. They are easier to handle with knife and fork, and no one is stuck with the back. Backs and wings necessitate digital manipulation. They are to be avoided if you have finicky eaters.

While chicken is considered rather ordinary fare in this country, in India it is still regarded as an indulgence reserved for the rich. To be served chicken in someone's house definitely means that you are getting special treatment. In restaurants it is always one of the more expensive items on the menu.

In my recipes you will notice that I often brown the chicken quickly before I leave it to cook. In India this browning is done either with the paste of onions, garlic, ginger, and spices or at the end, when the chicken is cooked and the sauce has been reduced over high heat. Since the bird cooks very quickly here, any attempt at browning during these two stages leaves my chicken a disintegrated, shattered mess. I have discovered that an initial browning of the chicken provides the right color and the bird does not fall apart.

## _Chicken cooked with yogurt_

SERVES 4–6

Here is a simple chicken recipe using very few of the spices generally associated with Indian cuisine. Yet the dish is typically North Indian. It is easy to make and very popular with children and adults alike.

_4 chicken legs_

_1 whole chicken breast_

_½ cup plus 2 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_5 medium-sized onions_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_7 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (as and if desired)_

Skin all the chicken pieces. Divide each leg into 2 pieces (drumstick and thigh). Quarter the chicken breast. Pat dry the chicken pieces and set aside.

Put ½ cup yogurt in a bowl. Add ¾ cup water, a little at a time, beating with a fork as you do so.

Peel all the onions. Cut 4 in half, lengthwise, then slice them into half-rings, about ⅛ inch thick. Chop the other onion coarsely.

Put the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in the container of an electric blender. Add 6 tablespoons of water and blend to a smooth paste.

Heat 5 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch pot over medium heat. Put in the sliced onions and fry them, stirring, 8 to 10 minutes or until they have turned dark brown at the edges but are still limp. Remove them with a slotted spoon to a small bowl and set aside.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot and put in about 4 pieces of chicken at a time. Fry them, at medium-high heat, 7 to 8 minutes or until they are browned on all sides. Remove chicken pieces to plate with a slotted spoon.

Turn heat to low and pour paste from the blender into the pot, keeping your face averted. Scrape the bottom of the pot for browned meat juices and mix in scrapings with the paste. Now raise the heat to medium and fry, stirring, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon plain yogurt, scraping bottom of pot and continuing to fry and stir another minute. Then add 1 more tablespoon yogurt, stirring for another minute.

Now put into the pot the chicken pieces, the well-blended yogurt and water mixture, the salt, and the cayenne pepper (if you desire it). Stir and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer 20 minutes.

Remove lid, raise heat to medium, and cook for 5 minutes to boil down some of the liquid, turning the chicken pieces carefully. (You should be left with a thick sauce.)

Mix in reserved fried onions, and cook at same heat another 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

To serve: Place contents of pot in warmed dish and serve with _hot pooris_ or hot _chapatis_ or almost any kind of rice. You might serve okra or eggplant or green beans as a vegetable. Since this dish is cooked with yogurt, serve a non-yogurt relish, such as Cucumber and Tomato with Lemon Juice. A fresh green chutney (mint or parsley) might also be refreshing.

## _Chicken in light sauce_

SERVES 4–6

Here is another relatively uncomplicated chicken dish made with whole spices _(khara masala)_ , ginger, and garlic. In India a whole chicken is used, skinned and cut into small serving portions. I often serve just legs and breasts since they are easier to handle with fork and knife and no one is stuck with the back.

This dish tastes particularly good if you make it a day in advance and let it sit in its sauce, covered and refrigerated, overnight. It can be reheated easily on top of the stove over a low flame.

_3 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_3 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 chicken legs_

_1 whole chicken breast_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 cinnamon stick, about 2½ inches long_

_2 bay leaves_

_5 whole cardamom pods_

_5 whole cloves_

_2 hot dried red peppers (optional)_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

In a small bowl, combine tomato sauce, yogurt, and 1 cup of water. Mix well and set aside.

Put chopped garlic and ginger into the container of an electric blender, along with 2 tablespoons of water. Blend until you have a smooth paste.

Cut chicken into serving portions: divide legs into drumstick and thigh, and quarter the breast. Remove skin from pieces of chicken and pat dry.

Heat oil in heavy-bottomed 10–12-inch casserole-type pot over medium-high heat. Put in chicken pieces, a few at a time, and brown on all sides. When each batch turns a golden brown, remove with slotted spoon and do the next batch. When all chicken pieces have been done, put the cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, and red pepper into the same oil. Stir once. The spices will darken immediately. Now pour in the paste from the blender (keep face averted as you do this) and add the turmeric. Stir and fry for about a minute.

Next, put in the browned chicken pieces, the mixture of tomato sauce, yogurt, and water, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently 20 to 25 minutes, turning chicken pieces a few times.

Uncover pot, raise flame to medium, and cook 5 to 7 minutes or until sauce is reduced to half, turning the chicken pieces over gently.

To serve: Put contents of pot into a hot bowl and serve with plain boiled rice or hot _pooris_. Serve at least one vegetable—green beans, eggplant, or cauliflower might be nice. As a relish, Tamarind Chutney with Bananas or Cucumber and Tomato with Lemon Juice could be served.

## _Chicken with potatoes_

SERVES 2–3

This dish is fairly similar to the preceding one. No yogurt is used, however, and the addition of boiled potatoes gives it a rather thickish gravy. If you wish to double this recipe, double all ingredients except the oil. Instead of 5, use 6 tablespoons of oil. Your cooking time will not change much, except that of course you will have to fry the chicken in two batches. You will also need a bigger pot. (In this recipe I use a skillet.)

_3 medium-sized potatoes for boiling_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_3 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1½ pounds chicken sections_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2½–3 inches long_

_1 bay leaf_

_4 whole cardamom pods_

_2 whole hot dried red peppers (optional)_

_2 whole black peppercorns_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_½ cup tomato sauce_

_2 cups chicken broth (canned or homemade)_

_½ teaspoon salt_

Put your potatoes to boil. When done, drain off water and leave potatoes to cool. (Do not use boiled potatoes which have been refrigerated for this recipe.)

Place onion, garlic, and ginger in container of blender with 5 tablespoons water and blend to smooth paste.

Remove skin from chicken pieces and pat them dry.

Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high flame, then add the cinnamon, bay leaf, cardamom, red peppers, peppercorns, and chicken pieces. Fry chicken pieces quickly on all sides until golden brown. Remove chicken with slotted spoon and set aside.

Pour the paste from blender into skillet, averting your face. Add turmeric and fry, stirring, for about 3 minutes. Now add the tomato sauce and the chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 15 minutes.

Peel and quarter the potatoes. Add salt, the browned chicken pieces, and the potatoes to the sauce. Stir, bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is tender. Turn chicken and potatoes a few times while they are cooking.

To serve: Put chicken pieces, potatoes, and sauce into a bowl and serve with hot _chapatis, parathas_ , or _pooris_. Serve green beans or peas with it and at least one kind of relish (a yogurt relish might be a good idea).

## _Chicken with sliced lemon and fried onions_

SERVES 4–6

Cooked with lemon slices, sugar, and fried onions, this chicken dish is unusual and quite delicious. You could use a whole fryer, cut into small sections, or you could buy just legs and breasts, dividing the legs into drumstick and thigh and quartering the breast.

_3–3½ pounds chicken_

_3 medium-sized onions_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_4 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_1 whole lemon_

_1 tablespoon sugar_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

Skin all the chicken pieces and pat them dry.

Peel the onions. Chop two of them coarsely and put them into the container of an electric blender. Cut the third one in half lengthwise, then slice it into thin half-rounds and set aside.

Add 6 tablespoons of water, the ginger, and the garlic to the onions in the blender and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat 6 tablespoons of the oil in a 10–12-inch pot over medium-high flame. When hot, put in the sliced onions and fry them, stirring, until they are darkish brown and crisp, though not burned. Remove onions with a slotted spoon and leave them to drain on paper towels.

In the same oil, brown the chicken pieces on all sides until they are golden. (Do this speedily over high flame so chicken browns but does not cook through. You will need to do it in at least two batches.) Remove chicken with slotted spoon to a bowl or plate.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot. Pour in the paste from the blender. (Keep face averted.) Stirring, fry on medium-high heat for about 10 minutes or until paste turns a nice golden brown. Now put in the coriander, cumin, and turmeric and fry, stirring continuously; after another 2 minutes add yogurt, a teaspoon at a time; after 2 or 3 minutes, the tomato sauce, a tablespoon at a time, continuing to stir and fry. Finally, add salt, cinnamon, cloves, cayenne pepper, and 1½ cups of water. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 10 minutes.

Cut the lemon into 4 or 5 slices, discarding the end pieces, and remove the seeds. Add lemon slices along with the chicken pieces, fried onions, sugar, and freshly ground pepper to the sauce, stir, and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is tender, turning the pieces every now and then. If chicken sticks to bottom of pot, add a little more water. You should end up with a very thick sauce.

To serve: Empty contents of pot into shallow serving bowl. Arrange the cooked lemon slices on top of the chicken pieces. Serve with any rice dish or with _pooris_ or _chapatis_. Yogurt with Tiny Dumplings goes well with it. For vegetables you could serve Carrots and Peas with Ginger and Chinese Parsley or cauliflower or any other vegetable you like. Almost any kind of _dal_ would also complement the dish.

## _Chicken with tomato sauce and butter_

SERVES 6

The original version of this dish is to be had at the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi. There, the _Tandoori_ Chicken is cut into small serving sections and put into a rich sauce of creamed tomatoes, butter, and spices.

My very inventive sister, Kamal, has worked out her own version, slightly different, but equally good. The Indian chicken being as tough as it is, what she does is to combine all ingredients—tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, butter, whole spices, and chicken sections—in a covered pot and cook them until the chicken is three-quarters done. By this time the meat has absorbed all the necessary flavors. Then she lifts off the cover and over a high flame stirs and fries the chicken and sauce until almost all the water evaporates and the chicken and pastelike sauce are a dark reddish brown.

This is very hard to do in America, because, as I mentioned earlier, the chicken is very tender and cooks too fast to allow all the flavors to be absorbed and the final frying to be accomplished without disintegration. So I have worked out a third version! Here it is.

_4 chicken legs_

_2 chicken breasts_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 stick of cinnamon, 2½-3 inches, broken up_

_Seeds from 6 whole cardamom pods_

_8 whole cloves_

_1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns_

_2 bay leaves, crumbled_

_1 hot dried red pepper (or more, as and if desired), crumbled_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_16 ounces (2 cups) canned tomato sauce_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_4 tablespoons lightly salted butter_

Remove skin from all chicken pieces. Divide legs into drumstick and thigh, and quarter the breasts. Pat dry and put aside.

In the container of an electric blender, combine the onions, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom seeds, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, red pepper, and 3 tablespoons water. Blend until you have a smooth paste.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch casserole-type pot over a high flame. When hot, put in the chicken pieces, 4 or 5 at a time, and brown them quickly (about a minute on each side). Remove with a slotted spoon. You will need to brown the chicken in several batches.

Turn heat to medium and pour in the paste from the blender. (Keep face averted.) Stir and fry the paste for 5 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot well as you do so. Now add the tomato sauce, ¾ cup water, and the salt. Bring to a boil. Cover. Turn heat to very low and simmer gently for 30 minutes, stirring every 6 or 7 minutes.

Add the chicken pieces to the pot, as well as any juices that may have collected. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat for 25 to 30 minutes. Stir gently every 5 or 6 minutes to avoid sticking and burning. Be careful not to break the chicken pieces as you stir. (This much of the recipe can be made up to a day in advance and refrigerated.)

Cut the butter into 4 pats. Take the chicken off the heat. Drop in the pats of butter and stir them in gently. Serve immediately.

To serve: Place contents of pot in a warm dish and serve with Rice with Frozen Black-eyed Peas or _naan_. For vegetables, you could have Eggplant _Bharta_ or Fresh Peas with Ginger and Chinese Parsley. You could, if you like, also serve Onions Pickled in Vinegar as they do at the Moti Mahal Restaurant in Delhi.

## _Chicken cutlets_

SERVES 2

Breaded chops and cutlets were brought to India by its last conquerors, the French and the British. They passed along the delicacy to the Indian upper classes, who were only too eager to ape and copy. But while these upper classes ate chops and cutlets as a status symbol, they were secretly very bored by the blandness of these foods. So they began to spice them up. Soon a whole new class of cooks developed. Under the distinguished titles of _khansama_ ("lord of the pot") and _babarchi_ , they cooked for the rich and specialized in Westernized foods adapted to the Indian palate, or, very often, Indian foods adapted to the Western palate. They could cook a treacle pudding just as easily as they could a roast duck stuffed with Indian herbs and spices, and a jam tart just as easily as a delicate _pullao_.

It is from this line of cooks that we get the recipe for chicken cutlets. Our family cook had not only inherited the recipe for an Indianized version of the cutlet, but he had also been taught a different name for it. As he said it, it sounded more like "cutliss" than anything else. So every Friday, which was the day off for all Muslim butchers (and most butchers were Muslim), we had either fish or chicken. And when it was chicken, it was frequently "chicken cutliss." The "cutliss" were very often served with boiled beans and potatoes as a first course for dinner. Then, as a second course, we had _chapatis_ with the usual Indian lentils and vegetables. For dessert, we switched again to a sponge roll or lemon tarts, both of which were very popular. These sudden changes of cuisine at the same meal struck no one as peculiar.

I use chicken breasts for the cutlets. One breast (two cutlets) serves one person generously, two people skimpily. If you are having cutlets as a first course, you could serve four people easily with two breasts. The chicken breasts are boned and skinned (your butcher will do this on request, but it is easy to do yourself), and marinated overnight in a paste of onions, garlic, ginger, Chinese parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. They are then dipped in a beaten egg, breaded, and fried. Very simple, and very mild.

_2 whole chicken breasts, boned, skin removed, and each breast split into 2 sections (about 1 pound of meat)_

_3 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_½ medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (this will make your chicken only very mildly hot; use 2 or 3 if you want it hotter)_

_2 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro), or Italian parsley as a second-best substitute_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_1 egg_

_Bread crumbs (homemade bread crumbs are best: leave 6 slices of white bread exposed for 24 hours, or until they harden; then crush with rolling pin or spin in the blender)_

_Vegetable oil, enough for at least ¼ inch in skillet_

GARNISH

_Lemon juice and wedges_

_Salt and freshly ground pepper_

_A few sprigs Chinese or Italian parsley_

_Four to 24 hours before cooking, marinate chicken_.

Place the garlic, ginger, onion, green chili, parsley, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in the container of an electric blender. Add a tablespoon of water and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste. (You may need to stop the blender and scrape down the paste a few times.)

Place the 4 boned and skinned chicken pieces in a bowl. Prick all over with a fork. Pour the marinade paste over chicken and rub into the pieces. Cover, and leave refrigerated 4 to 24 hours. (It will taste better if you can marinate it 24 hours.)

_30 minutes before serving:_

Beat the egg in a bowl.

Spread out the bread crumbs on a flat plate.

Lift out chicken pieces, one at a time, leaving marinade sticking to them. Dip first in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs. Coat both sides generously with bread crumbs and set aside. Prepare all chicken pieces this way, and let them sit, breaded, for 10 minutes.

_15 minutes before serving:_

Heat oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium-low flame. When the oil is hot, place chicken cutlets in the skillet and fry 6 to 7 minutes on each side. (Adjust heat carefully so chicken pieces turn a rich golden brown in the given time.) Remove gently with a spatula.

To serve: Place cutlets on a warm platter. Sprinkle with salt, freshly ground pepper, and lemon juice. Serve garnished with lemon wedges and Chinese or Italian parsley. With cutlets serve Rice with Peas or Rice with Potatoes and Cumin Seed and a green salad. If you like, you could serve boiled potatoes and peas. Almost all vegetables go with this dish.

## _Marinated broiled chicken_

SERVES 4–6

This is a simple recipe in which the marinade, a mixture of onions, ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, vinegar, and oil, is made in the electric blender. The chicken is marinated, then broiled. It could also be barbecued over charcoal.

_3–3½ pounds chicken, preferably legs, thighs, and breasts, or a whole chicken, cut into serving pieces_

MARINADE

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_2–3 fresh hot green chilies, or ¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_½ cup wine vinegar_

_½ cup olive or vegetable oil_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

GARNISH

_Chinese parsley or Italian parsley, chopped_

Combine all the ingredients for the marinade in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Pull off and discard the skin from chicken pieces. Prick chicken all over with a fork and place in a bowl. Pour marinade over chicken. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours (24 hours would be best.)

Fifty minutes before serving, heat your broiler. Remove chicken pieces from bowl and, with as much marinade clinging to them as possible, place on baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Broil 15 minutes on each side or until chicken gets well browned. (Adjust distance from broiler so it does not brown too fast.)

To serve: Place chicken on a warm platter and sprinkle parsley over it. Serve with a rice dish, a green vegetable, and a _dal_.

## _Broiled chicken strips_

SERVES 6–8

Chicken breasts are boned, cut into narrow strips, and then mixed with a paste consisting of oil, vinegar, onion, ginger, garlic, and fennel seed, and the "hot" _(garam)_ spices: cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, black peppercorns, etc. The chicken sits in the marinade 4 to 5 hours. It is then broiled and served. This dish is very easy to prepare, since most of the work is done by the electric blender. Its taste is heavenly, lightly but definitely spiced. It is very versatile—I have successfully served it as an hors d'oeuvre with toothpicks, at lunches with salad, at big dinners along with a meat dish, and at picnics, having made it the night before. It tastes as good cold as it does hot.

Get your butcher to bone and skin the chicken breasts for you. Many supermarkets sell already boned and skinned chicken breast "cutlets" which could be used, or you could do the skinning and boning yourself without undue exertion.

_3 pounds chicken breasts, boned and skinned (weight after boning and skinning)_

MARINADE

_5 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil_

_4 tablespoons red wine vinegar_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped_

_1 whole head of garlic (each clove peeled and chopped)_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and chopped_

_2 tablespoons whole fennel seeds_

_2 tablespoons ground cumin_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_Seeds from 8 cardamom pods_

_1 teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_8 whole cloves_

_20 black peppercorns_

_½–¾ teaspoon cayenne (use as desired; these measures are for a mildly hot dish)_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_3 tablespoons tomato sauce_

Combine all ingredients needed for the marinade in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Wipe all the chicken pieces thoroughly dry. Divide breasts in 2 sections and then cut each section into strips that are 1½ or 2 inches long and about ½ inch wide.

In a bowl combine the chicken and the marinade, and mix well. I use my hands to rub the marinade into the chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 5 hours.

Preheat the broiler (45 minutes before serving if you are going to eat it hot). Line a baking tray with aluminum foil. Spread the chicken (most of the marinade will cling to it) thinly on the tray. (You will need to do two batches unless you have an extra large broiler.)

When the broiler is well heated, put in the tray with the chicken. Broil for 10 minutes, turn the pieces over, and broil another 10 minutes, or until the chicken is lightly browned. Remove chicken pieces with a spatula and place in warm serving dish. Cover and keep in warm place. Do the second batch the same way. (I usually put the second batch in to broil and serve the first batch. As soon as people are ready for seconds, the next batch is almost ready.) Remember, this chicken will _not_ have a uniformly dark-brown color; it should be dark only in spots.

To serve: Place on warm platter and serve with a rice dish, a lamb dish if you are entertaining, a yogurt dish, and at least one vegetable. Serve as an appetizer with toothpicks. Eat it cold at picnics, also with the aid of toothpicks.

## _Roast chicken stuffed with spiced rice_

SERVES 4

If you are tired of your usual chicken roast, try this one. With the expenditure of just a wee bit more time and energy, you can create a sensational dish—spicy without being hot, simple without being dull!

I use precooked (usually leftover!) rice for the stuffing. Adjust the salt for the stuffing according to the saltiness of the precooked rice.

_1 roasting chicken, 4 pounds (at room temperature)_

MARINADE

_2 tablespoons olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_¼ teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_½ teaspoon ground cumin_

_¼ teaspoon ground garam masala_

STUFFING

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 cup canned whole tomatoes, drained, or 3 fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 cups (well-packed) cooked rice_

_½ teaspoon salt (or as needed)_

Mix all the ingredients for the marinade. Wipe chicken well with a cloth or paper towel so it is as dry as possible. Brush three-fourths of the marinade all over the chicken, inside and out. Let the chicken sit, unrefrigerated, for about 2 hours. Save rest of marinade.

Preheat oven to 450°.

Place the onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, coriander, and cumin in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat the 4 tablespoons of oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium-high flame. When very hot, drop in the mustard and cumin seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to rise and pop (15 to 30 seconds), add the paste from the blender, keeping face averted, as the mixture will bubble rapidly and splatter. Stirring, fry the paste on medium-high heat until it is browned. The oil should separate from the paste (this will take about 10 minutes). You will need to stir more frequently as the moisture evaporates.

Add the cooked rice, and the salt as and if you need it. Turn heat to low and mix the browned paste with the rice. Loosely stuff the chicken with the rice and truss it. Place it in an ovenproof baking dish, breast up, and put it in the preheated oven.

Let the chicken brown for about 20 minutes, basting it with the remaining marinade mixture every 5 minutes. Turn down the heat to 350°. Cook another hour or until the leg moves easily when pushed up and down at its socket. Baste every 10 minutes with the juices that will come out of the chicken.

To serve: Lift chicken gently and put on a warm platter. Let it sit for 15 minutes so juices will not flow out when carved. Serve simply with a green salad or, if you like, with any green bean, peas, or cauliflower dish. Sweet Tomato Chutney also tastes good with this roast.

## _Murgh mussallam (whole chicken with spices)_

SERVES 4

In this royal dish, a whole chicken is first marinated in a paste consisting of garlic, ginger, turmeric, hot green chilies, _garam masala_ , yogurt, and salt for about 2 hours. It is then browned and simmered with a second paste made up of fried onions and garlic, ginger, almonds, lemon juice, and an array of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, etc. Hard-boiled eggs are put into the sauce about 10 minutes before the chicken is done and then arranged around the chicken.

_1 whole chicken, about 3½ pounds_

_1 teaspoon loosely packed leaf saffron_

_4 hard-boiled eggs_

MARINADE

_6 cloves of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_½ teaspoon garam masala_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_4 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_2 fresh hot green chilies, sliced, or ¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

COOKING PASTE

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_4 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 tablespoon blanched almonds, slivered_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_Seeds from 4 large black or 8 small green cardamom pods_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

GARNISH

_2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese or Italian parsley_

_First make your marinade_.

Put the ingredients for the marinade in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Peel the skin off the whole chicken. Where it is hard to peel, as on the wing tips, you can leave it on. Prick the chicken all over with a fork, place in a bowl, and pour marinade over it. Rub the chicken well with the marinade, both inside and out, and leave, unrefrigerated, for about 2 hours.

Rinse out your blender container. You will need it again.

Soak the saffron in 2 tablespoons of hot water.

_Now make the paste to cook the chicken in_.

Heat 6 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a 10–12-inch heavy-bottomed pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the chopped onions, garlic, and ginger. Stir and fry for 8 to 10 minutes or until the onions are brown at the edges but still soft. With a slotted spoon, remove onions, garlic, and ginger and place them in the blender container. Reserve the cooking oil.

Place a small iron or aluminum skillet over a medium flame. When it is hot, put the blanched almonds in it. Stir them around until they turn golden, then add them to the blender container. In the same small skillet put the ground coriander and cumin. Stir, watching, until the spices turn a few shades darker (do _not_ let them burn). They will smoke quite a bit, but don't worry—it is to be expected. Then put them in the blender along with the cardamom seeds, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, salt, black pepper, cayenne, lemon juice, and ½ cup of water. Blend all to a smooth paste, pausing, if necessary, to push the mixture down with a rubber spatula a few times.

When the chicken has marinated for 2 hours, heat the reserved oil and add 2 more tablespoons of oil to it. Do this over medium-high flame. Lift the chicken out of the bowl along with any clinging marinade and place in the oil. Brown it as well as you can on all sides. You will not be able to do this too evenly, but it does not matter.

When the chicken has browned, turn heat down to low. Take the paste from the blender and, using a rubber spatula, spread it all over the chicken. Add 1 cup of water to the pot and bring to a boil. Cover tightly. Turn heat to low and simmer gently for about 40 minutes or until chicken is tender. Turn chicken 2 or 3 times during the first 15 minutes of this cooking time. After that, leave it breast up and baste it every 5 to 7 minutes with the sauce.

Peel the hard-boiled eggs, and 10 minutes before the chicken is fully cooked put them in the pot, spooning some sauce over them as well. Pour saffron and saffron water over chicken. Cover and continue simmering until chicken is tender.

To serve: Lift chicken carefully out of pot and place it on warmed platter. Arrange eggs around it. If you like, skim the oil off the sauce before pouring it over chicken and eggs. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve with a fish _pullao_ or Rice with Peas. You could also serve any vegetable you like: Fried Eggplants with Sour Green Chutney, or a cauliflower or bean dish might be nice. A yogurt relish is almost a must with _Murgh Mussallam_. I often serve Yogurt with Spinach.

## _Duck—stuffed and roasted_

SERVES 2

The duck here is stuffed with rice, spices, raisins, and nuts to make a superbly festive meal. I find that a 4–4½-pound duck really serves only two people well. It has a large cavity inside and rather small legs. Most of the meat is around the breast area, and that is not too much.

_1 duck, 4–4½ pounds, at room temperature—liver, gizzard, and heart included_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_15 fenugreek seeds_

_1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and ½ inch wide, grated or minced_

_1 hot green chili, cut into thin rounds, or ⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_3 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_3 tablespoons minced Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_2 cups cooked rice_

_2 tablespoons golden raisins_

_1 tablespoon dried apricots, chopped to the size of raisins_

_3 tablespoons pine nuts or slivered blanched almonds_

_½ teaspoon salt (more if the rice is unsalted)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_1½ teaspoons lemon juice_

_1½ teaspoons sugar_

_Additional salt, pepper_

If the duck was frozen, defrost completely well ahead of time. It must be at room temperature before you cook it. Pat it dry (otherwise it will not brown well). Prick the skin with a fork to allow the lining of fat to ooze out as it melts. Mince the liver, gizzard, and heart.

Preheat oven to 450°.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium-high flame, and add the cumin, fennel, and fenugreek seeds. Stir. When the cumin seeds begin to darken (this will take 10 to 20 seconds) add the onions, ginger, and green chili if you wish to use it. Fry, stirring, for about 2 minutes or until onions turn a little brown. Now add at intervals, continuing to stir and fry, the minced liver, gizzard, and heart; after a minute or two, the tomato sauce and minced Chinese parsley; in another 2 minutes, the cooked rice, turning heat to low; and finally, the raisins, apricots, and pine nuts or almonds, mixing everything well. Stir and fry another 5 minutes.

Season with salt, cayenne pepper (if you wish to use it instead of the green chili), black pepper, lemon juice, and sugar.

Stuff the duck loosely with the mixture in the skillet, truss, place it in roasting pan breast up, and set in the preheated oven.

Let duck brown for 20 to 25 minutes. There is no need to baste. Remove fat with a bulb baster as it accumulates in roasting pan.

Turn heat to 350° and let duck cook another 1½ hours, or until the juices of the bird run a clear yellow when it is pricked.

To serve: Place duck on a warm serving platter. Sprinkle skin with a little salt and freshly ground pepper. Serve with green beans or peas, or with a simple green salad if you like.

## _Khitcherie unda (scrambled eggs, Indian style)_

SERVES 2–3

_3 tablespoons butter_

_½ medium-sized onion, finely chopped_

_½ cup finely diced fresh tomato (1 smallish tomato)_

_1 tablespoon chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_½–1 hot green chili', finely sliced_

_4 medium-large eggs? well beaten_

_Salt and pepper to taste_

Melt the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sauté them for a minute or until they begin to turn translucent.

Add diced tomato, parsley, and sliced green chili. Stir and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until tomatoes soften a bit.

Pour in the beaten eggs. Sprinkle on salt and pepper lightly. Stir and move eggs around with a fork. Indians like their scrambled eggs rather hard (cooked about 3 minutes), but you can stop whenever the desired consistency has been achieved.

To serve: While some Indians eat their scrambled eggs with toast, others eat them with hot _parathas, chapatis_ , or _pooris_.

## _Chicken Moghlai_

SERVES 6

This rich, elaborate, saffron-flavored dish justifies the time taken in preparing it by its exquisite taste and appearance. It has a burnt-red color and smells of cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. It tastes even better if you cook it a night before serving it, thus allowing the sauce to act as a marinade for the chicken.

I use legs, thighs, and breasts of chicken for this recipe, but you could buy a whole 2½–3-pound chicken and have it cut into smallish serving portions. It may, then, feed only 4 people. You could also use 2 or 3 squabs, skinned and quartered, or 6 whole quail, skinned, or 6 whole partridges, skinned.

_2½–3 pounds chicken legs, thighs, and breasts_

_4 medium-sized onions, 2 peeled and chopped and 2 cut into half lengthwise, then sliced into thin half-rings_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1½ inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and chopped_

_8 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 cinnamon sticks, 2½–3 inches long_

_2 bay leaves_

_10 cardamom pods, slightly crushed_

_10 whole cloves_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seed_

_1½ tablespoons ground coriander *_

_½ tablespoon ground cumin *_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_3 tablespoons yogurt_

_¼ cup tomato sauce_

_1–1½ teaspoons salt_

_1 well-packed teaspoon leaf saffron,roasted and crumbled_

_1 tablespoon warm milk_

* _Dry-roasted together, following instructions forroasting ground coriander._

Skin the chicken pieces. Quarter the breasts and divide the legs into drumstick and thigh. Pat chicken dry and set aside.

Put the chopped onions, ginger, and garlic in the container of an electric blender along with 4 tablespoons of water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

In a 10-inch, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 8 tablespoons of the oil. Put in the sliced onions and fry, stirring, over a medium-high flame for 10 to 12 minutes or until onions are dark brown and crisp but not black and burned. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside in bowl or plate.

Raise heat to high and put the chicken pieces in the same oil a few at a time. Without letting chicken cook too much, brown to as dark a color as possible. Remove each batch to a platter.

Turn heat down to medium high. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot, and put in the cinnamon sticks, the bay leaves, the cardamom pods, the cloves, and the cumin seed. Stir and turn the spices once. Now put in the paste from the blender, and fry, stirring, for 10 minutes. Turn heat down to medium and add the dry-roasted coriander and cumin powder, the turmeric, and the cayenne pepper. Stir and mix for 1 minute.

Add at intervals, constantly stirring and frying, the yogurt, a little bit at a time, the tomato sauce, and after another minute, the chicken pieces and salt, and finally, after another 2 minutes, ½ cup water. Mix well, bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 30 minutes, turning chicken pieces gently every 8 to 10 minutes.

While the chicken is cooking, soak saffron in warm milk for 20 to 30 minutes.

When chicken is cooked, add the browned onions and the saffron-milk. Mix, cover, and simmer gently another 5 minutes.

To serve: This royal dish can be served very simply with _pooris_ and a relish, or it can be a part of a banquet along with a _pullao_ , a baked stuffed fish, and _Kheer_ for dessert.

## _Eggs Moghlai_

SERVES 6

Follow preceding recipe for Chicken _Moghlai_ , but substitute 12 hard-boiled eggs for the chicken.

Omit the step in which chicken is browned, and cook hard-boiled eggs in the sauce for only about 20 minutes. Put browned onions and saffron-milk over eggs and cook gently another 5 minutes.

To serve: See preceding recipe.

  round the age of seven, while I was still fishing with a bent pin for a hook and a piece of cane for a float, my greatest heroes were my brothers. A decade separated us in age—but it was more than the age difference that elicited my respect. They were "proper" fishermen. When _they_ went fishing it was not just to the Jumna River. The Jumna was, after all, just across the street from us, and therefore quite ordinary. With their tapering fishing rods and their complex array of reels, hooks, bait, jars, and nets, they set out to catch _rahu_ at the Okhla dam and trout in the cold streams of Kashmir.

They were always accompanied, on these trips, by _their_ hero, a mysterious, magnificent man called Munnia. I never knew his second name. I never really understood exactly who he was. Munnia was then about forty, tall and silent with shining dark brown skin and thick black wavy hair. He knew _everything_ about fish. He knew where the fish were biting, and when. He knew which bait was most effective on which day. I once saw him clad in a white loincloth, leaping on the slippery rocks that formed stepping stones across a shallow stream of water at the Okhla dam. Suddenly he stopped and jerked his head to one side. Silently he bent over. He held that pose patiently for fifteen minutes. Then he straightened up, triumphantly holding a _singhara_ that he had "tickled" and caught. Once the fish for the day had been caught, Munnia would open his knapsack, pull out a pot and some spices, light a fire with twigs, and produce an instant feast for his entire party. Often he would rub the fish with salt, turmeric, and hot red pepper and then fry it. Munnia's world was, of course, limited to fresh-water fish. I doubt if he ever saw an ocean or a fish from the sea.

With improved refrigeration some seafood is now available in all the major cities of India. While availability of mollusks remains limited to the coast, shrimp (called prawns in India), lobster, and pomfret can be found even in Delhi. And pomfret is, in my family, easily the most popular fish. It is a flat salt-water fish, on an average about 8 to 9 inches long, somewhat like a large butterfish, with its skeletal structure so obligingly designed as to make filleting a pleasure and eating a bone-free ecstasy. Its flesh is tender but firm, flaking delicately when cooked. The pomfret can be fried, baked, grilled, or cooked in banana leaves or green chutney. It is served at lunches, dinners, and official banquets.

Unfortunately, neither the pomfret nor the _rahu_ and _singhara_ mentioned earlier are available in America. What I will do in this chapter is to give you Indian recipes adapted for fish normally found in American fish markets. The recipes for shrimp and lobsters remain basically unchanged, but I have modified some of the pomfret recipes and used them for the striped bass, which I love, and the flounder. Instead of _rahu_ , I have used cod. You could also use carp.

Coconut palms fringe most of the India's coast from Bombay down to Cape Comorin and up again to Calcutta. Quite naturally, therefore, the fish caught along there are often cooked with grated coconut or with the "milk" obtained from soaking freshly grated coconut in water. In Bengal, where the populace has rioted when fish was temporarily unavailable, a paste made out of ground black mustard seeds is often added to fish to give it a very special nose-tingling pungency. Moghul recipes from North India call for neither mustard seeds nor coconuts, but often for northern spices like saffron.

I need hardly stress that fish must be bought fresh—the eyes must look bright and the gills very red. It must also smell fresh. Cook it until just done. Overcooking will make it disintegrate or—in the case of shrimp and lobster—become hard and leathery.

# _How to peel and devein shrimp_

This is really not as tiresome as it sounds. The secret is to make yourself entirely comfortable as you go about the task. Spread a double layer of newspaper at a table. Bring a clean plate, a sharp pointed knife, and a bag of shrimp to the table. Now pull up a chair and sit down. Shrimp, in American stores, nearly always have their heads removed before they are displayed, so what you are left with is the body, tail, and legs.

First of all, pull off the legs that dangle on the belly side. Next, peel the shell from the body. It will come off in wide rings. Pull off the tail separately. To devein, make a shallow incision along the length of the shrimp, right where the backbone would be if the shrimp had one—all the way from head to tail. Here you will see a threadlike tube, often filled with black or green or yellow substance. Pull this out. If you don't find it, do not discard the shrimp. It is still quite edible. Place all peeled and deveined shrimp on a clean plate. Next, wash shrimp thoroughly in cold running water and pat dry.

## _Marinated shrimp with whole spices_

SERVES 6

Shrimp are marinated in a paste of garlic, ginger, hot green chilies (or use cayenne pepper as a substitute), lemon juice, salt, and pepper. They are then fried with a bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and peppercorns. The actual cooking time is less than 10 minutes. The shrimp should be fried _just_ before serving.

_3 pounds shrimp (jumbo shrimp are particularly good for this recipe)_

_10 cloves of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1½ inches wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_2 fresh hot green chilies, sliced ( or use ¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper as substitute)_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

_1 teaspoon salt (more for sprinkling later if necessary)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_6 tablespoons olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2½–3 inches long_

_5 cardamom pods_

_6 whole cloves_

_10 whole peppercorns_

_1 bay leaf_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

GARNISH

_2 scallions_

Peel and devein shrimp. Wash under cold running water. Drain and pat dry as thoroughly as you can.

In the container of an electric blender, combine the garlic, ginger, green chilies, lemon juice, salt, and freshly ground pepper. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

In a bowl, combine the shrimp and the paste from the blender. Mix well. Cover. Leave, unrefrigerated, for an hour. If you wish to leave it longer (2 to 4 hours is fine), put bowl in the refrigerator.

Ten minutes before serving, heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over a high flame. Add the cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Stir for 10 seconds or until bay leaf darkens. Then put in the shrimp and marinade and let this mixture bubble and cook, stirring constantly, only until the shrimp turn pink and opaque all over. Remove them (and any whole spices that cling to them) with a slotted spoon and place them in a bowl. Add turmeric to contents of skillet. Keep cooking the marinade mixture over high flame, stirring all the time, until it becomes thick and pastelike. This will take just a few minutes. Now put the shrimp back into the skillet. Stir around until the shrimp are well coated; there should be no sauce left in the skillet. Check the salt. You may need to sprinkle on a bit more. Turn off heat.

To serve: Place the shrimp on a warm platter. Wash the scallions and slice into fine rounds, including at least an inch of the green part as well, and sprinkle them over the shrimp. Serve with a rice dish, some kind of lentils, a vegetable, and a yogurt dish. Warn people not to bite into the whole spices.

## _Shrimp with crushed mustard seeds_

SERVES 4

_1 pound shrimp_

_1 teaspoon black mustard seeds, crushed (use heavy mortar and_

_pestle or grinding stone)_

_⅛ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_4 tablespoons olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_2 cloves of garlic, peeled_

_2 slices of fresh ginger, 1 inch long, 1 inch wide, and 1⁄16 inch thick, peeled_

_1 hot dried red pepper_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Peel and de vein the shrimp. Wash under cold running water. Pat dry as thoroughly as you can.

In a cup, combine the crushed mustard seeds, turmeric, tomato sauce, and 2 tablespoons of water. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the cloves of garlic, the ginger slices, and the hot red pepper. Stir and turn around. In a few seconds, as soon as contents begin to darken, add the shrimp. Keep stirring until the shrimp turn pink and opaque. Now put in the mustard seed paste. Turn heat to a moderate low. Keep stirring. Add the salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Stir and fry another 2 minutes. Turn off heat.

To serve: Place on heated platter and serve with a rice dish or with _hot pooris_. Serve one or two vegetables with it, perhaps cabbage and peas, as well as a yogurt relish.

## _Shrimp with peas and parsley_

SERVES 4

_1 pound shrimp_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_Salt_

_Freshly ground pepper_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 tablespoons olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_3 tablespoons tomato paste_

_5 tablespoons minced Chinese or regular parsley_

_1 small (or ½ large) sweet green pepper, cut in ¼-inch squares_

_½ cup freshly shelled peas_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

Peel and devein the shrimp. Wash under cold running water. Pat dry. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.

Place the garlic and ginger in the container of an electric blender, along with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the shrimp. Fry and stir the shrimp until they barely turn pink and opaque all over. Remove them to a bowl with a slotted spoon.

Into the same skillet pour the paste from the blender. Add the turmeric and fry, stirring, over medium heat for about 2 minutes.

Lower the heat and add tomato paste, parsley, green pepper, peas, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, cayenne pepper, and 3 tablespoons of water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer gently for about 5 minutes or until peas are just cooked.

Remove the cover from the skillet, raise heat, and boil away most of the liquid. When a thick pastelike sauce remains, put the shrimp back in. Stir and cook until the shrimp are well coated (there should be almost no sauce left in the pan). Taste, and add more salt if necessary. Turn off heat.

To serve: Place in a warm dish and serve with hot _pooris, chapatis_ , or _parathas_ , or with any kind of rice dish. You could also have a sauced potato dish, e.g., Potatoes with Asafetida and Cumin or, if you like, Mushrooms with Cumin and Asafetida.

## _Shrimp with sweet Italian peppers_

SERVES 4

Even though green bell peppers are normally used for this dish, I often substitute the Italian peppers because of their sweeter taste. Try to pick them so they are about the same length—about 3 inches long. This dish has a wonderful sauce made up of onions, garlic, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf, tomato sauce, and lemon juice.

_1 pound shrimp_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_6 medium-sized Italian peppers_

_5–6 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and very finely minced_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and very finely minced_

_5 whole cardamom pods_

_1 bay leaf_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2½–3 inches long_

_6 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_1 teaspoon brown sugar_

Peel and devein the shrimp. Wash thoroughly under cold running water, drain, and then pat as dry as you can.

Place the shrimp in a bowl. Sprinkle them with ¼ teaspoon of the salt and the turmeric. Mix well with your hands, rubbing the salt and turmeric into the flesh.

Cut the caps off the green peppers. Slice each in half lengthwise, then into 3 or 4 long strips. Remove seeds.

Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over a medium-high flame, and fry the slices of pepper, stirring, for about 5 minutes or until they brown a bit and turn slightly limp. Remove them with a slotted spoon to a plate.

In the same skillet, adding a little more oil if necessary, stir and fry the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes or until they become pink and opaque on the outside. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl.

Turn heat to low. Add a tablespoon of oil to the skillet, and put in the minced onions and garlic, cardamom, bay leaf, and cinnamon. Sauté for 4 to 5 minutes or until onions get a bit soft. Now add the tomato sauce, coriander, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, brown sugar, the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt, the fried green pepper slices, and ½ cup of water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer very gently for 10 minutes.

Remove the cover and add the shrimp along with any juice that may have accumulated in bowl. Turn heat to medium high. Stir the shrimp to coat them with the sauce, and continue cooking and stirring 4 to 5 minutes while the sauce thickens. You should be left with only a little sauce at the bottom of the skillet.

To serve: Place in a shallow bowl and serve with rice and some kind of _dal_. Plain boiled rice and _karhi_ together with Cucumber and Tomato with Lemon Juice would make a very nice meal.

## _Shrimp in bread crumbs, Indian style_

SERVES 3–4

Follow recipe for Chicken Cutlets. Substitute 1 pound of jumbo shrimp for the chicken breasts. To prepare shrimp, peel and de vein them first, leaving the tails on. As you slit their backs for deveining, cut almost all the way through the shrimp but not quite—leave a bit of flesh intact so the shrimp can open up like a butterfly. Flatten each shrimp by hitting it with the broad side of a cleaver so it lies open (otherwise it will curl up).

You do not need to prick shrimp with a fork. Nor do you need to marinate it for 4 hours _—2_ hours in the refrigerator will do.

Directions for breading and frying shrimp are the same as for the chicken. You will, of course, be able to fry more shrimp in the skillet at one time.

## _Shrimp with brown sauce_

SERVES 6–8

_3 pounds shrimp (medium or jumbo size)_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_8 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_3 tablespoons vinegar (white or red)_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_12 whole fenugreek seeds_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_½ cup tomato sauce_

_5 tablespoonstamarind paste_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional—use as desired)_

_1 tablespoon brown sugar_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_3 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

Peel and devein shrimp. Wash, drain, and dry thoroughly. Cover and set aside.

Place the onions, garlic, ginger, and vinegar in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat the oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed, 4-quart pot over a medium-high flame. Drop in the whole fennel, cumin, and fenugreek seeds, and as soon as they begin to. darken pour in the blender paste, using a rubber spatula to get it out quickly. Stir and fry the paste for 10 to 12 minutes or until it is a golden brown.

Add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric to the fried paste, lower the heat, and continue to stir and fry for 2 minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce, raise the heat to medium, and stir and fry another 5 minutes. Finally, add the tamarind paste, salt, pepper, cayenne, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, mace, Chinese parsley, and 1 cup of water. Mix well, bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 30 minutes. (This much of the recipe can be made ahead of time if necessary.)

Ten minutes before serving, wipe the shrimp again. Bring the brown sauce to a boil and drop in the shrimp. Stir and mix well; continue cooking and stirring at high temperature from 5 to 10 minutes, until the shrimp turn opaque.

To serve: Spoon into warm serving bowl and serve with a rice dish. Rice with Peas might be nice, with a vegetable, a _dal_ , and a few relishes.

## _Shrimp with dill and ginger_

SERVES 4–6

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_1 fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (use more or less as desired)_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_1 teaspoon lemon juice_

_2 cups fresh dill, washed and trimmed_

_2 pounds medium-sized shrimp,peeled and deveined_

Place the ginger in the container of electric blender along with 3 tablespoons water. Blend until smooth.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium flame. When hot, put in mustard seeds. As soon as they begin to pop (10 to 15 seconds), add the following at intervals, continuing to stir and fry over medium heat: first, the paste from blender; after a minute, the green chili, adding a teaspoon of water if the mixture sticks; then the coriander, cumin, _garam masala_ , salt, lemon juice; and after another 2 minutes, the dill and ½ cup of water, bringing to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer 10 minutes.

Pat the shrimp dry and add to skillet. Turn heat to high, stir well and cook until shrimp turn opaque, about 5 minutes.

To serve: Serve with Buttered Saffron Rice and a salad. A relish with tomato or onion in it would also go well with this dish.

## _Shrimp, crab, or lobster, Kerala style_

SERVES 4–6

This dish comes from Kerala, a state along India's southwestern coast. Roasted coconut is added to the seafood to give it a thick, dark sauce. It is quite delicious.

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and finely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ¼-inch cube, peeled_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_½ cup grated and roasted freshcoconut_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 tablespoonground coriander, roasted_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_3 tablespoonstamarind paste_

_½ cup tomato sauce_

_½–¾ teaspoon salt_

_2 pounds medium-sized shrimp,peeled and deveined  
or 2 pounds uncooked lobster meat, cut into 1-inch pieces,   
or 2 pounds uncooked crabmeat, cut into bite-sized sections_

Heat oil either in deep 10-inch skillet or in 10-inch heavy-bottomed pot over a medium-high flame. Put in the chopped onions and fry, stirring, for 7 to 8 minutes or until the onions are slightly browned, but soft. Turn off heat.

In a blender container combine the ginger, garlic, and grated roasted coconut. Blend at high speed until tiny grains are formed. Add contents of blender container to skillet or pot. Also add the turmeric, coriander, cayenne, tamarind paste, tomato sauce, salt, and ¾ cup water. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 5 minutes.

(This much of the recipe can be made up to a day in advance. Keep covered and refrigerated until ready for use.)

Seven to 8 minutes before serving, bring the sauce to a boil. Add the shrimp or lobster or crabmeat, fold in, and cook at high temperature, stirring continuously, until the meat turns opaque (about 5 minutes). The sauce should be very thick and cling to the meat, but if you desire a thinner sauce, add a bit more water.

To serve: Place in warm bowl and serve with a rice dish and some kind of _dal. Masoor Dal_ with Vegetables would be good on this menu.

## _Baked striped bass with yellow rice_

SERVES 4–6

Baked or sautéed pomfret is normally used in this recipe. It also seems to work very well with striped bass. A paste of onion, ginger, garlic, and turmeric is first browned in oil. The fish is covered with it and then baked. The yellow rice is served on the side.

_1 striped bass, 3½–4 pounds, cleaned thoroughly, with head and tail still on_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_6 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_4 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ cup tomato sauce_

_3 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro); reserve a bit for garnishing (as substitute, use regular parsley or fresh dill)_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_⅛–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Preheat oven to 400°.

Wash the fish thoroughly in cold running water and pat dry, inside and out.

Place the onion, ginger, garlic, turmeric, and 4 tablespoons of water in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat oil in 8–10-inch skillet over medium flame, put in the whole cumin seeds, and as soon as they darken add the paste from the blender. Fry, stirring, for 5 or 6 minutes. Now add the tomato sauce and Chinese parsley. Cook, stirring, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Add salt, pepper, cayenne, cloves, and lemon juice, stir, and leave to cool slightly. (Check the salt in the paste. Remember it has to be enough to season _all_ of the fish.)

Cut 4 diagonal slits, at the same angle as the gills, on each side of the fish. Distribute paste inside fish, over fish, and inside the slits. Place fish on baking platter or on baking tray covered with aluminum foil, and bake 40 to 50 minutes, basting every 8 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the Yellow Rice.

_1 tablespoon vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1½ cups long-grain rice_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Heat oil in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. When hot, add cumin seeds. Stir a few seconds or until cumin seeds begin to darken. Add rice and turmeric. Mix and stir, fry for a minute, lower heat a bit if necessary. Add 2¼ cups water and salt. Bring to a boil, cover, turn heat down very low, and cook, without lifting lid, for 30 minutes.

To serve: It is much easier if your baking dish is also your serving platter. This way there is less danger of breaking the fish. If you do need to move it, however, be very, very careful during the transfer. You can arrange the rice around the fish if the platter is large enough. If not, serve the rice separately and garnish your fish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve with a green salad and sweet tomato chutney.

## _Sea bass in green chutney_

SERVES 2

Here is my version of a very popular dish in which the pomfret is smothered in green chutney and then cooked in banana leaves. Having no banana leaves handy, I use the prosaic but serviceable mainstay of the American kitchen—aluminum foil. It seems to work.

_1 sea bass, 1½–2 pounds (with head and tail on, but otherwise cleaned)_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_2 whole hot dried red peppers (optional)_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 cup chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

_½ teaspoon salt_

Clean and wash fish thoroughly under cold running water. Pat dry, inside and out.

Preheat oven to 400°

Place the ginger and garlic in the container of an electric blender, along with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend at a high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat oil in 8–10-inch skillet over medium-high flame, and add the mustard seeds. Within a few seconds, they will begin to expand and pop. Add the red peppers, and stir them once. Pour in the paste from the blender, add the turmeric, and fry, stirring, for about 2 minutes.

Pour contents of skillet into the blender. Add the Chinese parsley, lemon juice, and salt. Blend at high speed until you again have a smooth paste, adding up to 2 tablespoons of water if necessary.

Line a large baking dish with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, large enough to fold over the fish. Cover the fish with the green paste, inside and out. Fold the foil over so the fish is completely enclosed in it. Place in the oven and bake 30 minutes.

To serve: Remove fish carefully, place on warm platter, and serve with Plain _Basmati_ Rice. A tomato or onion relish would also go well with it.

## _Codfish steaks in yogurt_

SERVES 2

This easy-to-make dish is absolutely scrumptious. My Bengali sister-in-law, Maya, makes it with cut-up chunks of _rahu_ , a very popular fresh-water fish. Not finding any _rahu_ around, I've turned to cod. (You could also use fresh-water carp.) Cod flakes rather easily, so handle it very gently as it cooks. I leave the codfish in steaks (instead of cutting it into smaller sections) to avoid disintegration. In India, sliced hot green chilies are added to the fish 2 or 3 minutes before the cooking time ends. I have used cayenne pepper instead.

_2 codfish steaks, ¾ inch thick (about 1 pound offish)_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_3 medium-sized onions_

_6–8 cloves garlic_

_½ cup plain yogurt_

_Freshly ground black pepper_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_⅛ teaspoon sugar_

_6–8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_6 whole cardamom pods_

_2 cinnamon sticks, 2–2½ inches long_

Wash the codfish steaks. See that no scales adhere to skin. Pat them as dry as possible. Sprinkle steaks on both sides with the turmeric and ¼ teaspoon of the salt, rubbing the seasonings gently in.

Peel the 3 onions. Chop 2 of them very finely and set aside. Chop the third one coarsely and place in the container of an electric blender.

Peel and chop the cloves of garlic. Put them in the blender container along with the yogurt, remaining ½ teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne, and sugar. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth, thin paste.

Heat 5 tablespoons of the oil in a 12-inch skillet over a medium flame. Put in the 2 steaks and sauté them lightly, about 3 minutes on each side, turning them over gently and carefully. (They should not get brown or crisp.) Remove with a spatula to a plate. Pour the oil from the skillet into a small bowl, leaving behind any sediment or pieces of fish.

Wash and dry the skillet. Measure the oil in the bowl and put it back in the clean skillet. Add more oil to make up 5 tablespoons. Turn heat to medium, and when the oil is hot, put in the 2 finely chopped onions, the cardamom, and the cinnamon. Fry the onions lightly, stirring, until they turn a light, golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to low and pour in liquid from blender. Simmer (do not boil) on low heat for 10 minutes, stirring now and then.

Remove half of the sauce to a small bowl. Spread out the sauce in the skillet evenly, place codfish steaks on top, then pour the reserved sauce over them, spreading it evenly on top of the steaks. Cover and keep simmering at low temperature for about 10 minutes or until fish is cooked through.

To serve: I like to serve these steaks with plain boiled rice and a green salad with an oil and vinegar dressing, but you could choose any other rice dish and green beans, cauliflower, peas, or okra.

## _Stuffed flounder_

SERVES 2

Get your fishmonger to slit the whole flounder from its stomach down to its tail on the underside, and to remove its backbone. (You could do this yourself with a little patience and a very sharp knife, taking care not to destroy the outside appearance of the fish.) Make sure all the scales are removed and that the fish is washed out thoroughly. In this recipe, again borrowed from one for pomfret, the whole fish is stuffed with a mixture of potatoes, fried onions, ginger, and fennel, and then broiled. It is quite delicious. You can easily double or triple the recipe if you are feeding more people.

_3½ tablespoons oil, preferably olive or mustard oil_

_1 tablespoon whole fennel seeds_

_4 medium-sized onions, finely minced_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch long and 1 inch wide, grated_

_1 large potato, boiled and roughly mashed_

_Salt_

_Freshly ground black pepper_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_½ teaspoon garam masala_

_1½ tablespoons lemon juice_

_1 flounder, about 2 pounds, with head and tail on, cleaned, with scales and backbone removed_

_2 tablespoons butter_

GARNISH

_Chinese, Italian, or regular parsley_

Preheat the broiler.

Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in an 8–10-inch skillet over a medium flame, put in the fennel seeds, and fry, stirring, for about 5 seconds. Add onions and ginger, and continue to cook, stirring, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until onions are a darkish golden brown. Turn off heat. Add the mashed potato, ½ teaspoon salt, ⅛ teaspoon black pepper, cayenne, _garam masala_ , and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Mix well.

Line a baking tray with aluminum foil. Rub a little oil on it. Stuff fish with the potato stuffing and either close opening with skewers or sew it with a needle and thread. Place fish on aluminum foil. Sprinkle the upper side with salt, pepper, half the remaining lemon juice. Cut the butter into 6 pats and lay 3 of them over the fish. Place under broiler. Broil slowly, basting with the butter. When one side is a golden brown, turn the fish over carefully, sprinkle this side with salt, pepper, and remaining lemon juice, lay the remaining pats of butter on it, and broil it also to a golden brown, basting with the butter. Remove carefully.

To serve: Place on warm platter, decorate with parsley, and serve with either a green salad with an oil and vinegar dressing or some Indian vegetable dishes, such as green beans or carrots or peas.

## _Mackerel with onions_

SERVES 2

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_4 medium-sized onions, peeled and chopped_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_3 tablespoons (loosely packed) grated fresh ginger_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_½ teaspoon ground fennel or crushed fennel seeds_

_5 cardamom seeds, crushed_

_½ teaspoon ground cloves_

_½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional—use more or less as desired)_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_4 tablespoonstamarind paste_

_2 mackerels, 1–1½ pounds each, cleaned, with head and tail removed if desired_

GARNISH

_4 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_Extra salt and pepper_

_(To double the recipe, use 6–7 tablespoons cooking oil and double all other ingredients.)_

Preheat oven to 350°.

In 10–12-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. When hot, put in the chopped onions, the minced garlic, and the grated ginger. Fry, stirring, for 7 to 8 minutes or until the onions are lightly browned and translucent. Turn heat to low and add cinnamon, black pepper, fennel, cardamom, cloves, cayenne, salt, and tamarind paste. Stir and mix. Cook on low heat for 2 to 3 minutes until well mixed. Turn off heat.

Wash fish well and pat dry. Sprinkle inside and out lightly with salt and pepper. Make 3 or 4 diagonal slashes on either side of each fish. Place fish in oval baking dish. Put onion mixture inside, under, and over fish, stuffing some in the slashes. Pour any oil or juice left in skillet over fish. Cover fish with waxed paper cut about the same size as the oval dish. Place dish in oven and bake about 30 minutes or until fish is cooked through.

To serve: Place fish on a large warm platter and sprinkle with parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve with a rice dish and a simple green salad. I also like to serve it with grilled tomato halves, sprinkled with salt, pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice.

_"Butterflied" leg of lamb, marinated and barbecued_

_Cubed leg of lamb, barbecued_

_Boti kabab (cubed lamb kabab)_

_Kidney kabab_

_Seekh kabab_

_Marinated pork chops_

_Tandoori chicken—my version_

_Barbecued jumbo shrimp_

_Barbecued swordfish_

SEE ALSO:

_Cold yogurt soup_

_Seekh kabab, flat style_

 here are several kinds of Indian cooking that are done out of doors over a charcoal grill. Many of these dishes can make welcome additions to American summer menus.

Chicken, fish, beef, lamb, and pork are rubbed with a well-spiced marinade (slits are often made in the meat to absorb the spices) and then grilled over hot coals. An indoor broiler could of course be used for all the recipes in this chapter, but the taste will never equal that achieved by the outdoor grill. I find these recipes are particularly good for the summer months. If you wish to spend a day at the beach, you can marinate the meat in the morning, leave it refrigerated, and then come back just in time to light the grill and barbecue it.

# _Tandoori cooking_

The most popular school of outdoor cooking in India is the one from the former northwest frontier. (This was the northwest frontier of India until 1947, and is now the northwest frontier of Pakistan.) In Delhi, this style of cooking was totally unknown before the partition of the Indian subcontinent. Shortly after 1947, as waves of refugees crossed the border from both sides, a tiny restaurant opened in a lower-middle-class section of town. A family of refugees, with little more than a determination to start again, owned it. Called Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace), it was right on the main thoroughfare; it didn't look exactly hygienic; and it specialized in chicken, meats, fish, and bread cooked in a _tandoor_ (a clay oven with a live coal or wood fire). Within a few months, the cars of the rich began rolling up to its rather humble front doors to buy the very red-looking _tandoori_ chicken and the long, flat bread, _naan_. Now, almost two decades later, it is considered a Delhi landmark which no tourist is allowed to miss, frequented by ambassadors, princes, and movie stars (as well as the lower middle class for whom it was intended!). It now offers a choice of air-conditioned indoor seating or canopied outdoor seating accompanied by recitals of _qavvallis_ , poems set to a specific style of music. The tables, chairs, cutlery, plates, and waiters all have a very rough and ready look, but that is part of the attraction. _Tandoori_ chicken (chicken being a great delicacy in India) is now famous throughout the country and is served in all major restaurants. The chicken (or meat, fish, or bread) is placed in a clay oven, open at the top, with a blazing fire inside. The foods get deliciously roasted and are served with small onions pickled in vinegar. All the meats are marinated in yogurt and spices before being cooked. In India, they are also tenderized with crushed green papaya and given a bright orange appearance with a vegetable coloring, rather like the Spanish _bijol_.

### _Muslim cooking_

Another style of outdoor cooking which, for want of a better word, I'll call the "Muslim" school, includes the _seekh kabab_ and _boti kabab_. It consists of putting ground or cubed meat (kidney, liver, and udders can be used as well) on skewers and grilling them over live coals. The meats are either marinated first or, as in the case of chopped meat, ground to a paste with yogurt and then patted around a thick skewer. As they are turned and roasted, they are basted with _ghee_.

In Delhi, the best sampling of this Muslim school can be had around Jama Masjid, one of the largest and most beautiful mosques in Asia, built in the seventeenth century by the emperor who built the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan. Under the shadows of its massive walls, surrounding it on all sides, are hundreds of tiny stalls. They sell everything—pots, pans, bedcovers, saris, lungis (a kind of male "sarong"), and of course all the different _kababs_. On hot days, huge buckets of _thandai—_ a cool drink made with milk, almonds, and cardamom—are prepared and sold to thirsty passersby.

The recipes in this chapter are not Moti Mahal's, nor are they acquired directly from a Jama Masjid cook. They are mine—and are adaptations of the _tandoori_ and Muslim styles to the kinds of meat available here. When marinating meats, I tend to use olive or peanut oil in the marinade. Indians never use olive oil, but I like its taste and use it frequently.

# _Vegetables for outdoor meals_

In the introduction to the chapter on vegetables I discuss corn on the cob, grilled outdoors and served with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. In India this kind of corn usually is not served _with_ a meal, but only as a snack or with tea; still, you may like to try it with some of the meat dishes in this chapter. Traditionally, the vegetables, rice, and potatoes are cooked indoors and then served with the barbecued foods, but when the days are too hot or I am at the beach too long, I serve lots of salads and raw vegetables, all good accompaniments to Indian barbecued food.

I also serve at least one kind of _raita_ or yogurt dish; this is very easy to make and very refreshing. For good cold dishes, yogurt can be combined with boiled potatoes, with cucumber, with tomatoes and onion, with dumplings, with cooked or raw spinach, and best of all, with a combination of roasted eggplant (which you can do on the charcoal grill), raw onions, and finely minced fresh mint (see Yogurt with roasted eggplant).

For dessert I generally serve just fruit, but when confronted with guests who have a sweet tooth, I often prepare _Kulfi_ , a rich Indian ice cream made with nuts and milk, or _Kheer_ , a kind of cold custard made with milk and rice.

## _"Butterflied" leg of lamb, marinated and barbecued_

SERVES 10–12

This is, quite easily, one of my favorite meat dishes. I ask the butcher to "butterfly" a 8–9-pound leg of lamb for me. The "butterflying" process involves boning the leg in such a manner that the whole piece of meat lies flat, rather like a slightly uneven piece of London broil. I then marinate it for 24 hours in olive oil, lemon juice, and a paste of onions, garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, mace, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, _garam masala_ , salt, and an orange food coloring which gives it the orange look that traditional _tandoori_ meats have. After it is well marinated, it is best grilled outdoors on charcoal, though you could do it in your broiler—with less spectacular results! It is excellent to take along on cook-out picnics (pack the meat in a couple of plastic bags and the marinade in a tight jar—take along a pastry brush for brushing on the thick marinade paste), and refrigerated leftovers taste superb the next day. It is difficult to describe what "style" this meat is cooked in. It is perhaps a combination of the _tandoori_ school, my sister Kamal's lamb chops, and our Indian cook's roast mutton.

Note: You can always freeze half a butterflied leg of lamb and cook the rest. Halve all the ingredients in the marinade and cook the same way.

_1 leg of lamb, 8–9 pounds, butterflied_

_2 medium-sized onions (1 coarsely chopped, 1 for garnishing)_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 3 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5–7 cloves garlic (depending on preference—I use 7), peeled and coarsely chopped_

_⅔ cup lemon juice_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_1 cup olive oil_

_2½ teaspoons salt_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_½–1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional—use less if you like, or none)_

_½–1 teaspoon orange food coloring (Spanish bijol, or Indian food coloring obtainable in powdered form, or American liquid kind)_

GARNISH

_12 radishes_

Put the chopped onion, ginger, garlic, and 4 tablespoons of the lemon juice in the container of the electric blender, and blend at high speed to get a smooth paste (about 1 minute).

In a bowl or a pot with nonmetallic lining large enough to hold the meat, put the paste from the blender and all the other ingredients except the meat and the onion and radishes to be used for garnishing later. Mix well.

Carefully cut off all fat and tissue from the meat, and with the point of a knife make lots of jabs in it on both sides. Put the meat in the marinade paste. Fold the meat over, or cut it into 2 pieces, if there is not room. Make a few more jabs with the knife, and be sure the paste gets rubbed into the meat and goes way inside the gashes. Cover the container and leave refrigerated for 24 hours. Turn the meat over at least 3 or 4 times during this period.

The meat is now ready for grilling. But before you start, get your garnishes ready.

Peel the second onion and slice it into _very_ fine rounds (paper-thin if possible). Separate the rounds into rings and put them into a bowl of ice water, cover, and refrigerate.

Cut off the stems, leaves, and tips from the radishes and then cut them into flowers. (Starting from the tip end, start cutting into halves, but stop short as you reach the stem end. Next, cut into quarters and eighths the same way.) Put into a small bowl of ice water, cover, and refrigerate. It will look prettier if you use unblemished radishes of approximately the same size for this.

Now light your fire. If it takes 20 to 30 minutes to get red hot, start about 1 hour and 15 minutes before you intend to eat. When hot, place the metal grill at the lowest notch.

Lift meat from bowl (leaving marinade) and place on grill. Sear 5 to 8 minutes (depending on your stove) on either side. Now raise the grill to its topmost notch and cook about 20 minutes on each side. Brush frequently with the marinade until it is all used up. If you don't have a grill that moves up and down, just remember that the meat needs to cook about 50 minutes and it should be very dark on the outside and pinkish inside. Most Indians like their meat well done; you may prefer it a bit rare, but don't cook it too rare, as the spices inside won't get a chance to cook through.

To serve: Warm a large platter. Meanwhile place the meat on a carving board and slice it as you would a London broil—into thin, diagonal pieces. Use a very sharp knife, and do this as fast as you can, as you don't want the meat to cool off too much. Now slide the meat pieces onto the warm platter, leaving the slices in roughly the same shape as the piece of meat. Drain off the water from the radishes and onion rings. Arrange radishes around meat and lay raw onion rings on top of meat. Serve immediately.

This meat can be served with many kinds of foods. At a picnic, you could have it with a large green salad (head, Bibb, or romaine lettuce, with a simple oil and vinegar dressing) and roasted corn. If you are cooking it at home, you could serve it with _Sookhe Aloo_ ("Dry" Potatoes) and Green Beans with Onion Paste.

## _Cubed leg of lamb, barbecued_

SERVES 10–12

Here the leg of lamb is cut into 1-inch cubes, marinated as above, skewered, cooked, and served pretty much the same way as the butterflied leg of lamb.

Read the preceding recipe.

Just remember to remove all the fat and tissue from the meat cubes. After they have marinated overnight, push 6 or 7 cubes on each skewer and first sear on all four sides (5 to 8 minutes on each side). Now cook on each side for about 10 minutes, basting frequently.

Garnish and serve as above.

## _Boti kabab (cubed lamb kabab)_

SERVES 6

In this recipe, cubed lamb pieces are marinated overnight in a blend of yogurt, tomato paste, dry mustard, oil, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and a host of other spices. The next day, they are skewered and grilled over charcoal. The meat must cook slowly, as it needs to cook through. Also, nothing tastes worse than uncooked turmeric! (You could make this same recipe in a gas or electric broiler. Keep the meat about 4 inches from heat and cook 7 to 10 minutes on each side or until each side is well browned, depending on the heat of the broiler. It should not be too rare inside or the spices will taste uncooked.

_3 level tablespoons tomato paste_

_6 level tablespoons plain yogurt_

_2 teaspoons dry English mustard_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_¾ cup olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_¼ cup lemon juice_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 tablespoon ground cumin_

_1 tablespoon ground turmeric_

_1 tablespoon garam masala_

_½ teaspoon ground cloves_

_½ teaspoon ground mace_

_½ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_10 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of ginger, 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_¼–1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, or use as desired)_

_2½ pounds meat from leg of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes_

GARNISH

_1 medium-sized onion_

In the container of an electric blender, place the tomato paste, yogurt, mustard, salt, ½ cup of the olive oil, lemon juice, coriander, cumin, turmeric, _garam masala_ , cloves, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, and cayenne. Blend marinade paste at high speed until all the spices are well mixed and the ginger and garlic have pureed (about 1 minute).

Remove all the fat from the meat pieces. Stab pieces with the point of a sharp knife, then place them in a glass or ceramic bowl. Pour the marinade over the meat. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.

The meat will take 30 to 40 minutes to cook, so light your charcoal fire or preheat your broiler accordingly. String the meat cubes loosely on several skewers. If you crowd them too tightly, adjacent sides of the cubes will not brown. Arrange the grill so that it is not too close to the flame (4–5 inches away). Place skewers on grill and cook each side 7 to 10 minutes or until it is nicely browned. Baste frequently with remaining olive oil. When all sides are browned, remove meat from skewers and place on warm platter.

To serve: Peel the onion and slice into _very_ fine rings, paper-thin if possible. Separate the rings and place them on top of meat. Serve simply with green salad and boiled potatoes. (A good idea is to boil the potatoes ahead of time and then, when you begin your grilling, peel the potatoes, rub them with oil and some of the marinade paste, and broil them along with the meat for about 20 minutes, turning them as they brown.) This meat could also be served with Rice with Spinach or Rice with Peas. At a banquet, if you wish to serve a "sauced" meat and a "dry" meat, serve _Koftas_ and _Boti Kabab_.

## _Kidney kabab_

SERVES 6

Follow the preceding recipe. Substitute 2½ pounds of lamb kidney for the cubed leg of lamb.

## _Seekh kabab_

SERVES 6

This delicious recipe involves grinding the meat to a paste before wrapping it around the skewers. This fine paste is a little difficult to handle, but patience and perseverance will take care of _that_ problem.

_2 slices white bread_

_2 pounds ground chuck or ground lamb meat (put twice through the grinder)_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_½ cup chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro), or fresh mint, or ¼ cup each Chinese parsley and fresh mint_

_1 teaspoon ground cloves_

_1 teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_1 tablespoon garam masala_

_½–1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional), or 1–2 hot green chilies, finely chopped (optional)_

_1 egg_

_½ cup melted butter_

GARNISH

_1 medium-sized onion_

_2 lemons_

_Extra lemon juice_

Soak the bread in just enough water to dampen it; squeeze out any excess. Set aside.

If your butcher has not put the meat twice through the grinder, do it yourself.

In a large nonmetallic bowl, combine the meat, bread, chopped garlic, ginger, Chinese parsley and/or mint, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg, coriander, pepper, salt, _garam masala_ , and cayenne or green chili. Mix well. Put this mixture through the fine blade of a grinder once. Taste (if you are up to it), and add more salt if needed.

(This much can be done the night before. The meat can then be tightly covered and refrigerated. The _seekhs_ can be broiled in the afternoon, covered in aluminum foil, and set aside. In the evening they can be reheated, covered, in a 300° oven, and served.)

The meat should be covered and refrigerated for at least 2 hours.

Light the charcoal fire. (This dish can also be made in an indoor broiler.) While the grill is heating, peel the onion for the garnish and slice it paper-thin. Separate the rings and set them in a bowl of ice water, cover, and refrigerate.

When the fire is almost ready, begin to prepare your first batch of _seekhs_ for broiling. (The number of batches will depend on the size of your stove and the number of skewers you possess.) Break the egg into the bowl with the meat mixture. Mix well. Using your palm and fingers, wrap meat around the skewers, making sausage shapes about 6 inches long and 1 inch in diameter. You have to work fast, as the meat is very fine and tends to fall off; if it is too difficult to handle, add more dampened bread. As each skewer is done, place it on the grill, which should be about 5 inches away from the fire. You may need to put your palm under the meat as you carry each skewer to the fire.

In a small bowl, mix melted butter with ¼ cup warm water, and baste meat frequently with this combination. When one side is browned, slide a long spatula or cleaver under the meat and gently turn it over. Cook slowly until all sides are lightly browned and cooked through. Each batch of _seekhs_ will take you 15 to 20 minutes. As they are done, lift the skewers gently, putting a plate underneath in case of accidents, slide _seekhs_ off skewer, and place on warmed platter. Keep platter covered with aluminum foil and in a warm place. Prepare the remaining _seekhs_ in the same way.

To serve: Cut the lemons into wedges. Drain the onion rings and pat them dry on paper towels. Arrange the lemon wedges around the platter and lay the onion rings on top of the _seekh kababs_. Squeeze lemon juice over _seekhs_ before eating. Serve with _naans_ or _parathas_ or _pooris_ and a vegetable—perhaps Cauliflower with Ginger and Chinese Parsley—or if you like, with Rice with Spinach and Yogurt with Tiny Dumplings.

## _Marinated pork chops_

SERVES 4

In this recipe the pork chops should marinate for at least 6 hours.

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_8-ounce can of tomato sauce_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_½ teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_2 tablespoons olive oil_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional) or to taste_

_8 rib or loin pork chops_

Put the chopped onions, ginger, and garlic in blender and blend to a smooth paste (about 1 minute at high speed).

Combine paste with remaining ingredients except the pork chops and mix well.

With a fork, prod holes in the chops and put them in the marinade. Rub them well with the marinade, cover, and leave refrigerated for at least 6 hours.

Light the charcoal. When the fire is really hot, put the grill on its lowest notch. Lift the pork chops out and place them on the grill. Reserve any marinade. Sear for about 8 minutes on each side. Now put the grill in its highest notch and cook for about 20 minutes on each side. Brush with the marinade before you turn chops over each time.

To serve: If you want a very simple meal, these chops could be served with plain boiled potatoes and a salad of spinach or Boston lettuce or romaine and onion rings. Or if you like, you could serve it with Sweet Rice with Carrots and Raisins and Cucumber _Raita_.

## _Tandoori chicken—my version_

SERVES 6–8

I have already discussed _tandoori_ chicken at the beginning of this chapter. There are, however, two things that I need to point out here. The chickens used for the _tandoor_ in India are usually spring chickens, weighing 2–2½ Pounds each. They are cooked whole, with only wings and neck removed, on all sides at once. I find it more convenient to marinate and cook the chicken cut in pieces (it is also easier to serve and to eat this way). I buy the legs and breasts of broiling or frying chickens. (You may have an odd member of the family who just loves wings, and who will need to be placated some other way at some other time.) Also, I should point out again that Indians seem to dislike the chicken skin and always remove it before cooking.

The chicken in this recipe should be marinated for about 24 hours. Assuming that most people like both dark and light meat, I am allocating one whole leg and half a breast for each of 6 people.

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_6 whole cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

_8 ounces (1 container) plain yogurt_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_4 tablespoons olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, or use as desired)_

_½–1 teaspoon orange food coloring (use the Spanish bijol, or Indian powdered food coloring, or American liquid kind; its use is optional)_

_6 broiler or fryer chicken legs_

_3 broiler or fryer chicken breasts, halved_

GARNISH

_1 medium-sized onion_

_2 lemons_

_Extra lemon juice (optional)_

Make the marinade first. Put the chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and lemon juice in an electric blender, and blend to a smooth paste, about I minute at high speed. Place this in a bowl large enough to accommodate the chicken. Add the yogurt, coriander, cumin, turmeric, _garam masala_ , mace, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, olive oil, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and food coloring. Mix thoroughly.

Skin the chicken legs and breasts. With a sharp knife make 3 diagonal slashes on each breast section, going halfway down to the bone. Make 2 diagonal slashes on each thigh, also going halfway down to the bone. With the point of a sharp knife, make 4 or 5 jabs on each drumstick.

Put the chicken in the marinade and rub the marinade into the slashes with your fìnger. Cover and leave refrigerated for 24 hours. Turn 4 or 5 times while the chicken is marinating.

About 1½ hours before serving, light your charcoal. It should take 20 to 30 minutes to get red hot. Place the grill on its lowest notch.

Peel the onion for garnishing and slice it paper-thin. Separate the rings and set in a small bowl of ice water, cover, and refrigerate.

When the fire is hot, lift out the chicken pieces and place on the grill. Cook about 7 or 8 minutes on each side, then raise the grill a few notches to cook more slowly for another 15 to 20 minutes on each side. Baste with marinade as you cook.

To serve: Warm a large platter. Place the chicken pieces on it. Drain the water from the onion rings and lay them on top of the chicken. Quarter the lemons lengthwise and place them around the chicken. The chicken tastes very good with extra lemon juice squeezed on it.

This chicken is considered a delicacy and can be served at a banquet with _Pullao, naans_ , a few vegetable dishes, and onions pickled in vinegar.

Try it also with Rice with Spinach and Yogurt with Potatoes.

## _Barbecued jumbo shrimp_

SERVES 6

This dish tastes best when the shrimp are fresh. If, however, you wish to use the peeled frozen shrimp available in most supermarkets, allow them to thaw completely first. Then squeeze out all the water by pressing between your palms, and marinate after that.

_3 pounds fresh jumbo shrimp (you will get at least 40 shrimp)_

_½ cup olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_⅓ cup lemon juice_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 whole head of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1–3 fresh hot green chilies (if desired), sliced, or ¼–1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (if desired)_

_Salt_

_Freshly ground pepper_

GARNISH

_2 lemons cut into wedges_

_Fresh parsley sprigs or fresh dill_

Peel the shrimp and devein them. As you devein them, slit their backs three-quarters of the way through and then spread the shrimp out, butterfly fashion. When all the shrimp are done, wash them and leave aside to drain.

In the container of an electric blender, put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, ⅓ cup lemon juice, chopped onion, garlic, ginger, chilies or cayenne, 1½ teaspoons salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste (20 seconds).

(Note: If you are unsure of your ability to gauge how "hot" it will turn out to be, first blend in half a green chili, then the other half, then a whole, and so on. Taste a drop each time. Remember, though, that once the mixture is spread over the shrimp, it will taste only about half as hot.)

Place the marinade in a nonmetallic bowl. Pat the shrimp dry and put into marinade. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for an hour.

Light your charcoal, keeping grill at a medium distance from the fire, about 5 inches. Next to the stove place salt, pepper, the remaining olive oil, and a pastry brush for basting.

When the fire is ready, brush the underside of shrimp with oil and place them on the grill, leaving as much marinade on them as clings naturally. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the upper side and baste with oil. Let the shrimp cook until they brown slightly, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your stove. Then turn over with a pair of tongs, season again, and baste with oil. Cook another 5 to 10 minutes.

To serve: Place shrimp on warmed platter. Garnish with lemon wedges and sprigs of parsley or dill. For a simple meal, serve with Rice with Peas and a green salad. At a more elaborate dinner, serve with meat and chicken dishes.

## _Barbecued swordfish_

SERVES 4–6

I barbecue swordfish very much the way I do shrimp, and it tastes delicious. The marinade is almost the same as for shrimp, except for the addition of a teaspoon of ground turmeric. It is, of course, best to use fresh swordfish.

_2 slices of swordfish, 1 inch thick (about 3 pounds offish)_

_½ cup olive oil (or vegetable oil)_

_⅓ cup lemon juice_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 whole head of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1–3 fresh hot green chilies (if desired), sliced, or ¼–1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (if desired)_

_Salt_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_Freshly ground pepper_

GARNISH

_2 lemons cut into wedges_

_2 sprigs parsley_

Cut off the fat and skin along the length of the swordfish slices. Cut each slice into 3 pieces.

In the container of an electric blender, place 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, ⅓ cup lemon juice, and the chopped onion, garlic, ginger, green chilies or cayenne, 1½ teaspoons salt, turmeric, and ½ teaspoon pepper, and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste (20 seconds).

(Note: If you are unsure of your ability to gauge how "hot" it will turn out to be, first blend in half a green chili, then the other half, then a whole, and so on. Taste a drop each time. Remember, though, that once the mixture is spread over the swordfish, it will taste only about half as hot.)

Place the marinade in a nonmetallic bowl. Wash and pat dry the pieces of fish and place in marinade. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours. (Longer won't hurt.)

Heat the charcoal, keeping grill about 4 or 5 inches from fire. Next to stove place salt, pepper, the remaining olive oil, and a pastry brush for basting.

When the fire is ready, brush the swordfish slices with oil and place on grill. Sprinkle the top with a little salt and pepper. Baste with oil. Let it broil until one side gets little brown patches (about 10 to 12 minutes). Turn over with a spatula and broil on the other side. Sprinkle top with salt and pepper. Baste again with oil. Cook another 10 minutes or until this side is also lightly browned. Remove.

To serve: Place on warmed platter and garnish with lemon wedges and parsley. Serve with Rice with Spinach, Carrots and Peas with Ginger and Chinese Parsley, and Tomato and Cucumber with Lemon Juice. You could also serve it very simply with boiled parslied potatoes and a green salad.

 ndian vegetable markets are an absolute delight to the eye and a source of great anticipatory glee to the palate. The wily shopkeepers have been tutored by centuries of salesmanship and by fierce competition. They call to you as you walk by, offering you samples to handle. What better enticement can you have than a couple of small, firm, shiny eggplants placed on the palm of your hand, or a ripe Alphonso mango waved under your nose? Or they will entice you with: "These fresh fenugreek greens just came in from the fields—at least take a look!" Another of their tricks is to begin peeling a fruit just as you think you have succeeded in resisting them. A bunch of fresh red leechees is hard enough to pass up, but when they start peeling them and the fragrant fruit juice drips to the ground, you need no further urging to pull out your wallet.

India produces most of the kinds of fruit and vegetables found in America and many, many more. But, of course, everything is seasonal. You can expect corn only in August, September, and October, mangoes only in the summer, cauliflower only in the winter, and fresh mushrooms only during the humid monsoons. So a change of seasons for us is more than just a change of weather. Our menu changes considerably, and for most Indians who are vegetarians it changes drastically. If you eat carrot "water pickles" in the winter, you eat watermelon-rind pickles in the summer, and if you eat tangerines, guavas, and apples in the winter, you can have melons, loquats, and _cheekoos_ (a kind of round, all-brown persimmon) in the summer. There are no frozen vegetables or fruit to be had all year round, and no large-scale hothouses raising out-of-season vegetables. India does, now, produce varieties of dried vegetables, but they are used rather rarely. Winter is our good vegetable season, and summer brings the most luscious varieties of fruit.

When an Indian houswife goes shopping and buys about a dollar's worth of vegetables, the shopkeeper, if he is friendly, will throw in a handful of green chilies and a bunch of fresh coriander (Chinese parsley) free. These two items are, as you may have already noted in many recipes, essential to a lot of our cooking, and there is a detailed note on them at the beginning of the book. The Indian housewife will also stock up on ginger (the rhizome or "root"), considering herself very lucky indeed if she manages to find the young, tender ginger. This has many advantages. Its skin can be lightly scraped instead of peeled; the tough fibers have not yet developed so it can be used for an instant relish which combines ginger slices, lime juice, and salt; it can also be cut, chopped, grated, or minced with much greater ease. This young ginger looks slightly pink, and if you ever happen to see it in some store, do buy it.

Onions are another important vegetable. Raw, they are used for relishes and garnishing. Ground, they are used to make the paste in which some vegetables and meats are cooked. They can be sautéed or fried and then cooked along with cauliflower or eggplant or used as stuffing for okra pods.

India grows many varieties of mushrooms, the most delicious (and expensive) of which is one that grows in Kashmir and resembles a heart-shaped black sponge! I have not been able to find this anywhere in America so my recipes are adapted to the commercial variety found in most grocery stores.

Most Indians eat a lot of greens—fenugreek greens, mustard greens, white radish greens, gram (or chickpea) greens, and, of course, spinach. Each is seasonal, and each area has traditional ways of cooking its greens. In northern India, where I come from, fenugreek greens, being very strong-flavored, are nearly always cooked with tiny new potatoes in their jackets, or with carrots. The Punjab, in northwestern India, is famous for its creamed mustard greens, which both the poorest and the richest Punjabi serves with flat corn bread and a glass of buttermilk. When cooking white radishes, we tend to use both the radish and its leaves. It is not always easy to find white radishes here, and sometimes I substitute the Chinese horseradish, but that is sold with no leaves at all! Chickpea, or gram, greens, which I used to eat raw with salt and pepper, are not to be found in this country. Spinach, which is popular throughout India, is often creamed, or fried in batter, or cooked with meat.

Corn, in India, is available only during the late summer months. The fresh cobs, peeled and roasted, are sold on street corners, rather like chestnuts. The corn seller carries a portable hibachi-type charcoal stove on which he roasts his corn, and he sells it sprinkled with salt, red pepper, black pepper, and lime juice. I have tried roasting the hybrid "sweet corn" available in most American stores, but it is too tender, and very often it just shrivels up. The only times I have been successful have been with what most Americans would call the "tougher" ears of corn. If you ever do manage to find some "tougher" ears which won't "melt in your mouth," peel them and roast them over charcoal. They can be superb. And don't, for heaven's sake, put butter on them. Eat them either plain or sprinkled with salt, freshly ground pepper, and a little lime or lemon juice.

Fresh okra is not always easy to find, and when it it available be sure to buy it as you would green beens. Pick a pod up and snap it, and if it is young and crisp, you buy. Otherwise, walk on. If you are lucky enough to find good fresh okra, you can slit and stuff the pods with fried onions and spices; you can slice them very fine, deep-fry them until they are crunchy and serve them with an omelet; you can also slice them and cook them with onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes.

Potatoes are a popular staple throughout North India. Not only are they cooked in combination with meats, other vegetables, rice, and _dals_ , but they are also cooked with every imaginable permutation of spices. A young child may want his potatoes boiled and then fried with cumin seeds; at a picnic one might have "dry" potatoes cooked with red peppers, fenugreek, fennel, cumin, and mustard seeds; at a banquet one might be served potatoes cooked with yogurt and the _garam maslas_ , cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaves, etc.; and of course, there is my favorite, potatoes cooked with asafetida and cumin, a "wet" dish best enjoyed with _pooris_.

A vegetable that was once basically ignored in America and that is now evoking the first stirrings of interest, is the eggplant. Still, it seems confined to the occasional parmigiana, moussaka, or ratatouille. It deserves better. Stuffed, baked, and covered with sauce, it makes a glorious main course. Its roasted pulp, when mixed with yogurt and fresh mint, makes a refreshing summer "salad." Deep-fried in slices and smothered in one of many sour chutneys, it can serve as an appetizer or an accompanying vegetable dish.

I can't really begin to list all the Indian vegetables and fruit. We have a "pickling" carrot that is dark red, like a beet; during late winter, Indians buy green chickpeas, or _chholas_ , which can be cooked or eaten raw; our sweet potato has the consistency of a crumbly Idaho baking potato; we eat lotus stems and water chestnuts; we have _jamuns_ and _falsas_ and _bair_ and _kaseru_ and _parval—_ fruits and vegetables which don't even have any English names. And this list could go on and on.

The recipes in this chapter are mostly for vegetables that can be found in supermarkets—beans, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, eggplant, peas, potatoes, etc. I do have some recipes for okra which should be cooked only when fresh pods are available.

## _Green beans with onion paste_

SERVES 4–6

Green beans can be cooked in many ways. In India we tend to overcook them—at least according to the best Chinese and French standards. But as I have explained earlier, it is mainly to kill germs and because we love spices. We like our spices to permeate a vegetable, and this cannot happen unless a vegetable is allowed to become fairly tender. When you finish preparing this recipe, your beans will not look bright green, nor will they be very crisp. They will be a brownish dark green, smothered in spices, and utterly delicious.

_1½ pounds fresh green beans_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_3 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch square, coarsely chopped_

_1 medium-sized canned tomato, coarsely chopped_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_1 or 2 whole dried red peppers (optional), or ½ hot fresh green chili, sliced in half (optional) or ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)_

_2 teaspoons lemon juice (or to taste)_

GARNISH

_1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese parsley (fresh coriander greens or cilantro)_

Wash the beans. Trim the ends. Slice them into fine rounds about ⅛ to ¼ inch thick. (This takes a while, so it is best to sit down somewhere with chopping board and sharp knife and do about 8 beans at a time.)

Put the onion, garlic, ginger, tomato, and turmeric in a blender and blend to a smooth paste.

Put 6 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in an 8-inch skillet or heavy-bottomed pan, and heat it on medium. Pour in mixture from blender and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring all the time, adding a teaspoon of warm water if and when it starts to stick at the bottom. Now put in the coriander and cumin and continue frying another 5 minutes, again adding a teaspoon of warm water if necessary to prevent sticking.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the remaining tablespoons of oil over medium flame. When very hot, put in the whole cumin and mustard seeds. After 10 seconds, add the whole red peppers if you are using them. Stir once, and as the peppers darken and the mustard seeds begin to pop, put in the sliced green beans and the sliced green chili if you are using it. Now scrape up all the mixture from the first skillet and add it to the beans. Fry the beans on medium flame for 5 minutes, stirring all the time. Turn heat to low, add the salt and lemon juice, and let the beans cook covered, stirring now and then, until they are tender (about 35 minutes). If you are using cayenne pepper, stir it in 5 minutes before end of cooking time. If the beans stick to the skillet, add 1 tablespoon of water, stir, and keep cooking.

To serve: These beans can be cooked in advance and reheated over a low flame. Serve them in a warm dish and, if you like, sprinkle finely chopped Chinese parsley over them. They are good with _Koftas_ and plain rice, go well with nearly all meats, and especially well with _parathas, pooris_ , and _chapatis_.

## _Green beans with ginger_

SERVES 4–6

This dish is simple to make and has a very fresh, gingery taste.

_1½ pounds fresh green beans_

_A piece of ginger, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_½ fresh hot green chili (optional), washed and sliced very fine_

_3 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (fresh coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_1¼ teaspoons garam masala_

_2 teaspoons lemon juice (or to taste)_

_1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)_

Wash the green beans and trim the ends. Slice into fine rounds, ⅛ to ¼ inch thick. When all the beans are chopped, set aside in a bowl.

Put the ginger in the blender with 3 tablespoons of water and blend at high speed until it is a smooth paste.

Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. While it is heating, pour in paste from blender and add turmeric. Fry, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, then add the sliced green chilies and the parsley, and after another minute, put in the green beans and continue cooking and stirring for about a minute. Add the cumin, coriander, 1 teaspoon of _the garam masala_ , lemon juice, salt, and 3 tablespoons of warm water. Cover skillet, turn flame very low, and let beans cook slowly for about 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so.

To serve: These beans can easily be cooked in advance and reheated. Serve them in a warm dish, with ¼ teaspoon _garam masala_ sprinkled on top.

They go well with nearly all meat and chicken dishes. They can be eaten with plain boiled rice and _Moong Dal_ , or served with _hot pooris_ or _parathas_ or _chapatis_.

## _Green beans with mustard_

SERVES 4–6

Here is another easy recipe for beans, in which they are slightly sweet.

_1½ pounds fresh green beans_

_3 level tablespoons plain yogurt_

_½ hot fresh green chili, sliced very thinly, or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_3 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_1 teaspoon sugar_

_¾ teaspoon dry English mustard_

_¾ teaspoon ground cumin_

_2 teaspoons lemon juice_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_5 whole fenugreek seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_¼ teaspoon garam masala_

Wash green beans and trim ends. Slice finely into rounds of about ¼ inch.

In a cup or small bowl, mix the yogurt with the green chili or cayenne, parsley, salt, sugar, dry mustard, cumin, and lemon juice. Add 3 tablespoons water and mix well.

Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the whole fenugreek and cumin seeds. When the fenugreek seeds begin to change color (about 20 seconds) put in the beans. Fry, stirring, for about 5 minutes.

Beat the yogurt mixture once again and stir into the beans. When the skillet begins to make bubbling noises, cover, reduce heat to very low, and allow to cook slowly for 40 minutes. Stir every 10 minutes or so.

To serve: Place in warm serving dish and sprinkle _with garam masala_. Serve with Rice with Cauliflower and Cumin Seed, _Masoor Dal_ , and Chicken with Tomatoes and Butter. Or serve with _Kheema_ , plain boiled rice, and _Moong Dal_. Or serve with _parathas_. If you are having many vegetables, then serve these beans with Cauliflower with Ginger and Chinese Parsley, _Sookhe Aloo, Khare Masale Ka Gosht_ , and hot _chapatis or pooris—an_ excellent meal.

## _Cabbage with onions_

SERVES 4–6

There are many ways of cooking cabbage in India. It can be cooked by itself or with peas or potatoes. It can be cooked with shrimp and with meat. Here are some of these recipes. Just remember that when you start cooking the cabbage, it looks like a lot. But it reduces. So make sure you cook enough to feed all the people you are planning for. I find that one medium-sized head of cabbage will feed 4 people easily. It can be stretched to 6 if there are many other dishes. As with most of our vegetables, we tend to overcook cabbage, but the end result tastes very good, so who cares!

_1 medium-sized head of cabbage_

_2½ medium-sized onions_

_9 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_6 whole fenugreek seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 1 inch by 1½ inches, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 medium-sized canned tomato_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_½–1 hot green chili, thinly sliced (optional)_

_¾–1 teaspoon salt_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Trim away the outer damaged leaves of the cabbage, wash it, and cut it in quarters. Remove the stem and hard core and shred cabbage lengthwise as finely as you can.

Peel 2 of the onions and cut them each into half, lengthwise. Now slice finely into half-circles.

Heat 6 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, and add the fenugreek, cumin, mustard, and fennel seeds. As the seeds start sizzling and changing color (about 10 seconds), put in the sliced onions. Fry them over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Add the shredded cabbage, stir a few times, put the lid on, lower flame, and cook for 15 minutes.

Uncover and cook over fairly low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.

Meanwhile, peel and coarsely chop the remaining ½ onion and put it with the garlic, ginger, and canned tomato in electric blender. Blend to a paste.

In a skillet heat the 3 remaining tablespoons of oil. Add the paste from the blender, the turmeric, and the green chili. Fry, stirring all the time, for 8 to 10 minutes (adding, if necessary, 1 teaspoon of warm water at a time to prevent sticking). When the cabbage has cooked for 30 minutes, add this fried paste mixture, along with the salt, _garam masala_ , and lemon juice. Stir and let it cook for another 5 minutes.

To serve: Serve with _parathas, pooris_ , or _chapatis_. If serving with rice, serve _karhi_ or _dal_ and a chicken or meat dish like Chicken Cooked with Yogurt or Lamb _Korma_ or _Koftas_. Plain yogurt or Yogurt with Potatoes would also go well with it.

## _Cabbage leaves stuffed with potatoes_

SERVES 6–8

Cabbage leaves can be stuffed with meat or potatoes. Here is my mother's recipe for the latter.

_5 medium-sized potatoes_

_7 medium-sized onions_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_3½ teaspoons salt_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_1 medium-sized head of cabbage_

THE STUFFING

Boil the potatoes, then peel and dice them into ¼-inch pieces.

Peel the onions, cut them in half lengthwise, and slice them into fine half-circles.

In a skillet, heat 6 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, frying, stirring, and separating the rings until the onions are brownish, about 7 or 8 minutes; they should not get crisp.

Add the fennel and cumin seeds and fry another 7 or 8 minutes on lower flame. The onions should look a rich reddish brown now.

Add the diced boiled potatoes to the onion mixture and continue frying. As you fry, mash the potatoes with the back of a slotted spoon or potato masher.

To the potato and onion mixture add the _garam masala_ , 2½ teaspoons salt, cayenne pepper if desired, and lemon juice. Mix it all up and set aside, uncovered, to cool slightly.

THE CABBAGE

Cut off the hard stem of the cabbage, remove the hard, damaged outer leaves, and wash it. In a pot large enough to hold the whole cabbage, bring to a boil water to which 1 teaspoon salt has been added. Drop the cabbage in (the water should cover at least three-quarters of it), cover, and allow to boil for 5 minutes. Lift cabbage out of boiling water, run under cold water, and carefully remove each leaf, taking care not to break them. Dry. If the inner leaves are still crisp, drop them again in the boiling water until they go limp. Remove and cool under cold water.

Spread out one leaf at a time. Snip out the hard core of the outer leaves with a sharp knife or a pair of kitchen shears. You can snip to about an inch into the leaf, removing a kind of narrow V. Now place a tablespoon of the stuffing in the center of the leaf and fold the edges over. Put the stuffed leaf on your left palm and with your right palm gently squeeze out any extra moisture. This also helps to keep the stuffed cabbage leaves tightly closed.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Squeeze each stuffed cabbage leaf again between paper towels and put in skillet. Fry, a few pieces at a time, until each piece is browned on all sides. Take care not to let the leaves open. Remove them to a plate. When all the pieces are done, lower the heat, arrange the stuffed cabbage pieces in the skillet in tight layers, add 2 tablespoons water, cover, and cook on very low flame for 10 to 15 minutes.

To serve: Remove very carefully and serve on large, warm platter. Serve with Cubed Lamb with Onions and Raisins and Rice with Peas or with _Karhi, Koftas_ , and plain boiled rice. This dish is also very good served with hot _parathas_.

## _Carrots and peas with ginger and Chinese parsley_

SERVES 4–6

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches by 1 inch, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1½ pounds young, slim carrots_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_5 whole fenugreek seeds_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 packed cup coarsely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 fresh hot green chili, washed and finely sliced (optional, or substitute ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper)_

_1 pound fresh peas, shelled_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Put the ginger in blender with 3 tablespoons of water and blend until smooth (about one minute).

Peel the carrots and slice them into rounds about ⅛ inch thick.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. When very hot, add the mustard and fenugreek seeds. When mustard seeds begin to pop (10 to 20 seconds), put in the ginger paste and turmeric, keeping your face averted. Fry for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add chopped parsley and green chili or cayenne, and cook, stirring, another 2 minutes. Add carrots and peas and cook 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.

Now put in the coriander, cumin, _garam masala_ , salt, and 3 tablespoons of warm water. Stir for a minute, cover, lower heat, and cook slowly 30 minutes. Stir gently every 10 minutes or so.

To serve: Lift gently out of skillet and place on serving dish. Serve with hot _pooris_ or _parathas_. This dish goes well with any sauced meat dish—Lamb with Onions and Mushrooms, _Kheema_ , etc. It is also good with Shrimp with Dill and Ginger, plain _Moong Dal_ , and Rice with Potatoes and Cumin Seed.

## _Cauliflower with ginger and Chinese parsley_

SERVES 6–8

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2½ inches by 1 inch, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 large head fresh cauliflower, or 2 small ones_

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 fresh hot green chili, finely sliced, or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 packed cup coarsely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_2 teaspoons salt_

Put the ginger into a blender jar with 4 tablespoons of water, and blend until it becomes smooth (about 1 minute).

Cut off the thick, coarse stem of the cauliflower and remove all leaves. First break the cauliflower into large flowerets, using your hands if it is a loosely packed head and a sharp knife if it is too tightly packed. Since you want to end up with _small_ flowerets, not longer than 1 to 154 inches and not wider at the head than ½ to 1 inch, I find that the best way is to take each large floweret and begin by slicing the stems crosswise into fairly thin rounds. Keep these, as they are quite edible. When you reach the upper end of the stem, start breaking off the small flowerets. Slice the stem into rounds whenever it seems too long, and keep the rounds. Wash the florerets and the stem rounds in a colander and leave to drain.

Heat oil in 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the ginger paste and turmeric. Fry, stirring constantly; after about 2 minutes, add green chili or cayenne and parsley; after another 2 minutes, put in the cauliflower, continuing to cook and stir for 5 minutes. (If necessary, add 1 teaspoon warm water at a time to prevent sticking.) Now add the cumin, coriander, _garam masala_ , lemon juice, salt, and 3 tablespoons warm water, cook and stir for about 5 minutes, then cover, lower flame, and let cook slowly for 35 to 45 minutes (the tightly packed cauliflower takes longer to cook), stirring gently every 10 minutes. The cauliflower is done when it is tender with just a faint trace of crispness along its inner spine.

To serve: Lift out gently and place in serving dish—a low, wide bowl would be best. Serve with hot _chapatis, pooris_ , or _parathas_ , or serve with any kind of lentils and plain boiled rice. It is particularly good with Lamb _Pullao_ and Cucumber _Raita_.

## _Cauliflower with onion and tomato_

SERVES 6–8

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 large head fresh cauliflower, or 2 small ones_

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 medium-sized fresh or canned tomato, peeled and chopped_

_1 tablespoon chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 fresh hot green chili, washed and finely sliced, or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_2 teaspoons ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Put chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in blender with 4 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste.

Break off cauliflower into small flowerets (see preceding recipe), not longer than 1 to 1½ inches, and not wider at the head than ½ to 1 inch. Wash in colander and leave to drain.

Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed 10–12-inch pot over medium flame, pour in the paste from the blender, and add the turmeric. Fry, stirring, for 5 minutes.

Add the chopped tomato, parsley, and green chili or cayenne, and fry 5 minutes. If necessary, add 1 teaspoon of warm water at a time and stir to prevent sticking. Now put in the cauliflower, coriander, cumin, _garam masala_ , salt, and lemon juice. Stir for a minute. Add 4 tablespoons warm water, stir, cover, lower flame, and allow to cook slowly 35 to 45 minutes (the tightly packed cauliflower heads take longer to cook). Stir gently every 10 minutes or so. The cauliflower is done when each floweret is tender with just a faint trace of crispness along its inner spine.

To serve: Follow suggestions of previous recipe.

## _Fried eggplants with sour green chutney_

SERVES 6

_1 packed cup chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 fresh hot green chili, washed and finely sliced, or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_8 ounces (1 container) plain yogurt_

_½ teaspoon salt (a little more if you need it; sometimes yogurt is more sour than at other times)_

_½ teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_Vegetable oil for deep frying_

_6 small, oval eggplants or 1 large one (eggplants come in so many sizes that after reading this recipe, I'm afraid you have to be your own judge about how many you need)_

_8 fenugreek seeds_

_½ teaspoon fennel seeds_

_½ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_¼ teaspoon cumin seeds_

_Salt_

_Freshly ground black pepper_

FOR THE CHUTNEY

Put parsley and chili in blender with 3 tablespoons water and blend until smooth paste (about 1 minute). You may need to push parsley down a couple of times.

In a bowl, combine yogurt, salt, roasted ground cumin seeds, lemon juice, and the paste from blender. Cover and refrigerate green chutney until ready for use.

COOKING THE EGGPLANTS

Ten minutes before eating time, heat oil at a depth of 1½ to 2 inches in skillet, wok, or _karhai_ over medium heat. While heating, wash and dry eggplants. If you have the small, oval ones, quarter them lengthwise, preserving the stem and the sepals. If you have a very large one, quarter it lengthwise and slice each quarter into ½-inch-thick pieces.

When shortening is very hot, add the fenugreek, fennel, onion, and cumin seeds. After 10 or 20 seconds, drop in as many eggplant pieces as the container will hold in one layer. Deep-fry each batch until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle each batch with salt and freshly ground pepper, and place in a warm dish. When the eggplant has fried, spoon one-quarter of the cold chutney over it and serve immediately. Serve the rest of the chutney on the side.

To serve: While the eggplant fries, I usually put all the rest of my dinner into serving dishes and bring them to the table. I bring the eggplant dish out last. This dish is usually served at meals along with other vegetables. It is very rarely the only vegetable at the table. Try it at a Sunday lunch along with Shrimp with Dill and Ginger, Rice with Frozen Black-eyed Peas, and green beans.

You can also cut the eggplant fairly small, insert toothpicks, and serve it with drinks.

## _Fried eggplants_

SERVES 4

This dish is made best with the small young eggplants that are only 3 or 4 inches long. It is very simple, but _cannot_ be prepared in advance. Ten minutes before you are to eat, excuse yourself and go cook the eggplants. Serve them crisp and piping hot. (You can take the rest of the food to the table while the eggplants fry.)

_Vegetable oil for deep frying_

_8 whole fenugreek seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_4 small oval eggplants, 3–4 inches long_

_Salt and freshly ground black pepper_

_Dash of cayenne pepper, if desired_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Put 1½ to 2 inches of oil in a wok, _karhai_ , or skillet and heat on medium heat.

Measure out fenugreek, fennel, cumin, and onion seeds and keep handy. Wash and wipe the eggplants (leave them unpeeled), and slice lengthwise into flat, ⅛–⅙-inch slices.

When the oil is heated, put in all the seeds. When they change color or begin to pop (5 to 10 seconds), put in the sliced eggplant pieces—only as many as your utensil will hold in one layer. Fry to a golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt, black pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice.

To serve: Serve each batch hot, as soon as it is seasoned. The eggplant should be slightly crunchy. This is really a side dish which should never be the only vegetable at a meal. Serve it along with Carrots and Peas with Ginger and Chinese Parsley or cauliflower as an accompaniment to any meat, chicken, or fish. You can also use it as a garnish for baked fish or a chicken roast by arranging the slices, petal-like around a platter.

## _Fried eggplants with tomato chutney_

SERVES 6

To make this recipe, first prepare the tomato chutney, and 10 minutes before serving, fry the eggplants according to directions in previous recipe. They will be served with the hot chutney spooned over them.

TOMATO CHUTNEY

_Lump of tamarind size of large walnut_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 tablespoons olive oil_

_⅛ teaspoon ground asafetida, or_ ⅛ _-inch lump asafetida_

_4 whole cardamoms_

_4 whole cloves_

_1 teaspoon whole mustard seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 cup tomato sauce_

_1 teaspoon salt (or more to taste)_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_1 teaspoon sugar_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_4 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

Soak the lump of tamarind in ¾ cup hot water. Leave at least 4 hours or overnight. Make paste (about ½ cup).

Put onion and garlic in electric blender with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend at high speed to a smooth paste (1 minute).

Heat olive oil in 2-quart pot, preferably with nonmetallic lining, over medium heat. Put in the asafetida, then add the cardamoms and cloves, and finally the mustard and cumin seeds. When the seeds pop, expand, and change color (10 to 20 seconds), add the paste from the blender, keeping face averted. Fry paste, stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes, sprinkling a teaspoon of warm water in it if it sticks.

Now add the tamarind paste, tomato sauce, salt, cayenne (if desired), _garam masala_ , cinnamon, sugar, and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover and allow to simmer gently for 15 minutes.

While chutney is simmering, prepare eggplants according to previous recipe.

Taste the chutney, and check the salt and sugar. You may want to put in more of one or the other. At this stage, I pick out the cardamoms and the cloves from the chutney and discard them. Mix the parsley with the chutney.

To serve: Arrange the fried eggplants on a platter. Pour some of the hot chutney over them and serve the rest on the side. See preceding recipe for suggested accompaniments.

## _Eggplant bharta (smoked eggplant)_

SERVES 4–6

Until the advent of gas, most cooking in India was done on wood or coal, and one of the waste products of wood and coal is, of course, ash. Not wishing to waste even a waste product, we geared our cuisine so that while some foods were cooking on top of the flame, others were being roasted in the ashes. (Later, the ash was used like Comet to scour the pots and pans.) As a child, I remember begging the cook to put some onions in the ashes, just for me. He would pick out a tiny onion from the vegetable basket and bury it deep in the ashes with his iron tongs. Then, about an hour later, he would whisper to me that it was ready. I would pick off the burned outside, scorching my hands as I did so, and gobble up the succulent inside.

Another vegetable that was roasted was the eggplant. Once roasted, it was peeled and the inside was either mixed with chopped raw onion, fresh mint, and yogurt or cooked further with onions and tomatoes—which is the recipe I'm going to give you now.

Lacking ashes in my apartment kitchen, I roast the eggplant right on top of the stove over an open flame. This is a bit messy, so I would advise you to insert an aluminum burner liner before you start.

_1 large eggplant, preferably with a stem_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_½ fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (optional)_

_1 tablespoon chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro);_

_reserve a little for garnishing_

_2 medium-sized canned tomatoes, coarsely chopped_

_¾–1 teaspoon salt (according to size of eggplant)_

_1 teaspoon lemon juice_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

Line your gas burner with an aluminum liner or plain aluminum foil. (If you have an electric stove, place the eggplant under a preheated broiler, and turn it around until it is blackened on all sides, although it will never taste quite as smoky as when done over a flame.) Stand your eggplant, stalk up, directly over a medium-low flame. Leave it there until the bottom has burned black and looks completely scorched. Now lay it on its side. As soon as the area nearest the flame darkens and turns soft, turn the eggplant slightly. Use the stem of the eggplant to turn with. Keep turning until the whole eggplant is done. (You could use tongs, but take care not to burst the eggplant or you will have a big mess.) As more and more of the eggplant is "scorched" it will turn softer and be more difficult to handle. Don't give up. This whole process will take 20 to 25 minutes.

Once the eggplant is "smoked," put it on a plate and carry it to the sink. Put it under cold running water and peel the blackened outer skin under the running water. Drain, shaking off as much water as you can.

Put the peeled inside of the eggplant on a chopping board and chop it coarsely. Set aside in a plate or bowl.

Put the onion, ginger, and garlic in a blender with 3 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste at high speed.

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. While heating, pour in the paste from the blender and add the turmeric. Fry this mixture, stirring frequently; after about 5 minutes, when it begins to turn brown, add the green chili and the Chinese parsley; then after about 1 minute, the chopped tomatoes. Lower the flame and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Finally, add the chopped eggplant, raise the flame to medium low, and fry, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, seasoning with the salt, lemon juice, and _garam masala_.

To serve: Remove the _bharta_ to a warm dish and serve sprinkled with Chinese parsley. It is best when eaten with _pooris_ or hot _chapatis_. Serve _Khare Masale Ka Gosht_ with it and _Sookhe Aloo_ ("Dry" Potatoes).

## _Mushrooms with cumin and asafetida_

SERVES 4–6

_1½ pounds fresh mushrooms_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_A generous pinch ground asafetida, or ⅛-inch lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 whole hot dried red peppers_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 cup tomato sauce_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Clean mushrooms. Chop off the coarse stem ends.

Heat oil in 3-quart pot over medium heat, and put in the asafetida. It will sizzle and expand within 5 seconds. Now add the cumin seeds, and as soon as they darken (5 to 10 seconds), the red peppers. Stir once and add the turmeric and the mushrooms. Stir mushrooms for ½ minute and add the tomato sauce, 2½ cups of water, and the salt. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently 15 to 20 minutes.

Remove from heat. The mushrooms can be eaten now, but it is better to let them sit 1 to 2 hours to absorb the taste of the brothlike sauce and then reheat.

To serve: Serve in little individual bowls. The thin, delicious sauce can be eaten with a spoon or with hot _chapatis_ or _pooris_. You can easily build a meal around the mushrooms. _Sindhi Gosht_ , Yogurt with Tiny Dumplings, and a _dal_ would complete the meal nicely.

## _Crisp fried okra_

SERVES 4

I have discussed okra earlier. Buy it only when it is young, fresh, and crisp. Serve this crisp-fried okra to people who think they dislike okra—they will hardly recognize it. Another advantage of this dish is that it cooks easily and quickly. It can take less than 15 minutes from the time you begin washing the okra until you serve it.

_1 pound fresh young okra_

_Oil for deep frying_

_Salt_

_Freshly ground black pepper_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_½ teaspoon garam masala (optional)_

Wash the okra. Wipe it with paper towels. Remove head and tail and slice the pods in rounds of ⅛-inch thickness. You can slice 2 or 3 at the same time.

Heat 1 inch of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-low flame. Check heat by dropping in one slice of okra; if it sizzles immediately, the fat is ready. Put in as much okra as will fit in one layer. You will need to do at least three batches. Fry each batch 4 to 5 minutes, until the okra turns crisp and a bit brown.

Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels to drain. Sprinkle each batch with salt, pepper, cayenne, and _garam masala_. Serve immediately.

To serve: Fried okra is delicious with a mushroom omelet for lunch or with a variety of other vegetables at dinner. Okra goes particularly well with _Urad Dal_ and with _Koftas_. Or you could use it as an unusual garnish for a lamb roast, frying about 2 pounds of okra and surrounding the leg of lamb with it.

## _Okra with onions_

SERVES 4–6

This is the way okra is generally cooked in most parts of Delhi. The success of this dish depends upon the onion paste's being cooked to the right consistency before the okra is added.

_4 medium-sized onions, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_5 cloves of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_Apiece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches long, 1 inch thick, and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_3 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_1 pound fresh young okra_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_2 teaspoons garam masala_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Put onion, garlic, and ginger in electric blender, add ¼ cup warm water, and blend to a paste.

Heat oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin and fennel seeds. When the fennel begins to change color (20 seconds or so), add the paste from the blender and the turmeric.

Cook this paste over medium heat for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping the bottom. The paste will reduce and turn a lovely brown color.

Add the coriander and fry, stirring; after a minute, add the tomato sauce and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Turn off the heat under the skillet.

Wash the okra and wipe it with a paper towel. Slice a few pods at a time into ¼-inch rounds.

Turn the heat to medium again under the skillet with the onion paste. Add the okra, salt, _garam masala_ , lemon juice, and 6 tablespoons of warm water. When the onion paste starts bubbling, cover, turn heat very low, and allow to cook slowly for 35 minutes, or until tender. Stir every 10 minutes or so to prevent sticking.

To serve: Serve like stuffed okra, the next recipe.

## _Stuffed whole okra_

SERVES 4–6

This recipe, which comes from my maternal grandmother, is perhaps _the_ most delicious way to cook okra. Fresh young okra pods are slit and stuffed with a mixture of fried onions, fennel, cumin, and fenugreek. Then they are lightly fried and allowed to simmer until cooked. Stuffing the slim okra requires a little patience, but don't let that stop you. The most confirmed okra hater will be converted and the ooooh's and aaaah's of your guests will be ample reward for your trouble.

_10 medium-sized onions, peeled and finely chopped_

_8 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches by 1½ inches by 1 inch, peeled and grated_

_2 teaspoons whole cumin seeds_

_4 teaspoons whole fennel seeds_

_20 whole fenugreek seeds_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_Salt_

_4 teaspoons garam masala_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

_1 pound fresh young okra_

THE STUFFING

Since this dish is to be cooked in two 10-inch skillets to accommodate all the okra, divide the onions, garlic, and ginger into two equal piles. Make two separate equal piles of the cumin, fennel, and fenugreek seeds.

Heat 5 tablespoons of oil in each skillet over medium heat, and when hot, put in the cumin, fennel, and fenugreek seeds. As they begin to pop and change color (5 to 10 seconds), put half the onion, garlic, and ginger and ½ teaspoon turmeric into each skillet. Stir and fry over medium heat for about 12 minutes until the onions look a rich brown. Stir frequently.

Add ½ teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon _garam masala_ to each skillet and stir. Turn off heat under both skillets. Using a slotted spoon, remove onion mixture from skillets, leaving as much of the cooking fat behind as possible. You will need it later. Collect the onion mixture from both skillets in a bowl, add 2 more teaspoons _garam masala_ and the lemon juice, mix, and set aside to cool.

THE OKRA

Wash the okra and pat it dry with paper towels. Trim off the head and the lower tip.

Since the stuffing of the okra takes a little time, place the okra, the bowl of stuffing, a clean platter, and a small sharp knife on a table, and settle yourself on a chair. Pick up one okra pod at a time. Make a slit along its length, being sure that you do _not_ go through the opposite side and that you leave about ⅛ inch at the top and bottom unslit.

Assuming you are right-handed, slip your left thumb into the pod to keep the slit open. With your right thumb and fingers, pick up a little stuffing at a time and push it into the slit. You will need from 54 to 1 teaspoon of stuffing for each pod, depending on its size. As each pod is stuffed, set it aside on the platter.

Turn on the flame under both skillets and keep on medium-low heat. Divide the okra between the two skillets and lay them slit side up in the pans in a single layer if possible (a few overlapping won't matter). Cook for 5 minutes, shake salt (about ¼ teaspoon to each skillet) over okra, add 2 tablespoons warm water to each pan, cover, lower flames to very, very low, and cook gently for 30 minutes or until the okra is tender.

To serve: Lift out gently and arrange on warm platter. Serve with Lamb _Pullao_ or Rice with Peas, Pork Chops à la Jaffrey, and Potatoes with Asafetida and Cumin. It also goes very well with all Indian breads.

## _Whole pea pods with cumin_

SERVES 4

This is an unusual dish which I have eaten only in my own family. The peas are not shelled, but cooked whole, and are eaten rather like artichokes. Each pea pod is picked up by its stem, placed in the mouth between the teeth, and then pulled; you are eating not just the peas but the fleshy part of the pod as well. All that you leave is the stem and the inner tough lining of the pea pod. Needless to say, the peas that you buy must be very fresh and tender and not too long or you might just gag! The peas must also look very green and undamaged.

_1½ pounds fresh peas_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_⅛-inch lump asafetida, or ⅛ teaspoon ground asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_½–1 teaspoon gar am masala_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

Wash the pea pods, discarding any old ones.

Heat the oil in a wide 10–12-inch casserole-type pot over medium heat. When hot, add the asafetida and cumin seeds. In 10 or 20 seconds the cumin seeds will begin to change color. Put in the pea pods immediately and stir for a minute. Now add the lemon juice, ½ teaspoon _garam masala_ , salt, and pepper. Stir, put in 2 tablespoons of warm water, cover, turn heat to very low, and allow to cook gently for 20 to 30 minutes, until tender. Stir once or twice while cooking, but do it gently.

To serve: Lift pea pods out very carefully (some may have split, but that is quite normal). Serve in a warm dish, sprinkled with ½ teaspoon _garam masala_ , if desired.

This dish may be served at a lunch, with an Indian "tea," or as an appetizer at dinner.

## _Fresh peas with ginger and Chinese parsley_

SERVES 4–6

Follow the recipe for Carrots and Peas with Ginger and Chinese Parsley. Substitute for the carrots and peas 3 pounds of fresh peas. Shell them and then proceed according to the recipe. Cook till peas are tender, about 10 minutes.

Serve with fresh _parathas_ , Potatoes with Asafetida and Cumin, and _Koftas_. Instead of _parathas_ , you could substitute Rice with Potatoes and Cumin Seed, _Moong Dal_ , and Cucumber _Raita_.

For a Western meal, try serving it with a loin of pork or roast leg of lamb.

## _Sookhe aloo ("dry" potatoes)_

SERVES 6–8

Here is a very simple potato dish which can even be made with leftover boiled potatoes. In fact, it is best if the potatoes are boiled at least 4 hours in advance of the final cooking.

_7 medium-sized potatoes, boiled in their jackets and cooled_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_⅛ teaspoon ground asafetida, or ⅛-inch lump asafetida_

_1 teaspoon-whole fennel seeds_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_12 whole fenugreek seeds_

_3 whole dried hot red peppers_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1½ teaspoons salt (or to taste)_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Just before you start, peel the boiled potatoes and dice them into pieces about 1 inch by ½ inch.

In a wok, _karhai_ , or 10–12-inch pot, heat the oil over medium flame. When very hot, put in first the asafetida, 5 seconds later the fennel and cumin seeds, then the mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds in quick succession. As they begin to change color and pop (about 10 seconds), add the red peppers. As soon as the red peppers swell and darken, add the diced potatoes, turmeric, and salt. Keep on medium heat and fry, turning gently so as not to break the potatoes. Fry for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes are browned unevenly. Squeeze lemon juice over potatoes, and check the salt.

To serve: Lift out carefully with a slotted spoon and serve in a shallow dish. Warn guests not to bite on red peppers unless they mean to. This dish goes very well with most Indian meals. (I used to take _sookhe aloo, parathas_ , and mango pickles to school as my lunch.) It can be taken on picnics, where it can be heated in aluminum foil and served with _parathas_ or _pooris_ , or it can be served with a lamb or pork roast as a "different" kind of starch. Try it also with my marinated charcoal-broiled "Butterflied" Leg of Lamb.

## _Pyazwale sookhe aloo ("dry" potatoes with onions)_

SERVES 6–8

Here is another simple potato dish that can be served as a vegetable with _pooris_ or as an appetizer, on top of crackers.

_6 medium-sized potatoes_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_⅛ teaspoon ground asafetida, or ⅛–inch lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2½ teaspoons whole black mustard seeds_

_1–3 whole dried red peppers (optional—1 red pepper will make it mildly hot; 3, very hot)_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1¼ teaspoons salt_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Boil the potatoes in their jackets. Peel them and mash them coarsely with a fork or hand masher.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over medium heat. When hot, first put in it the asafetida; after it has sizzled for a few seconds, add the cumin and mustard seeds; then in 10 seconds or so, the red pepper (or peppers). When pepper changes color (1 to 5 seconds), put in the chopped onions and turmeric. After the onions have cooked 3 to 5 minutes and turned brown at the edges, put in the mashed potatoes, salt, _garam masala_ , and lemon juice. Fry, stirring and mixing, for 5 to 7 minutes.

To serve: Place in a warmed dish and serve with _chapatis, pooris_ , or _parathas_. This is a good dish to take on picnics, too. Serve as an appetizer on top of Melba rounds or crackers. (Remove whole red peppers before placing on any kind of toast.)

## _Potatoes with asafetida and cumin_

SERVES 4–5

This was one of the most popular potato dishes in our family. It is a "wet" dish and needs to be served in small individual bowls. It is very good—and easy to make.

_4–5 medium-sized potatoes_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_⅛ teaspoon ground asafetida, or ⅛–inch lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1–2 dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_½ teaspoon turmeric_

_1½ cups canned tomato sauce_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Wash, peel, and quarter potatoes. Put them in bowl with cold water to cover.

In 2–3-quart pot, heat oil over medium heat. As it heats, put potatoes in colander to drain. When the fat is hot, put in the asafetida; after it sizzles (5 seconds), add the cumin seeds; when they sizzle and change color (5 to 10 seconds), add the red peppers, which will begin to change color in a couple of seconds. Now put in the drained potatoes and the turmeric. Fry the potatoes for about 2 minutes, stirring them now and then.

Now put in 2 cups water, tomato sauce, and salt. Bring to boil. Cover and allow to simmer very gently for about 1½ hours.

To serve: Take to the table in a deep dish. Give each person a little bowl to serve himself the potatoes as well as the sauce. These potatoes are best served with _pooris, chapatis_ , or _parathas_ , but they are also good with plain boiled rice and Lamb with Onions and Mushrooms. Leftovers can be put in the blender or mashed to make an excellent soup.

## _New potatoes cooked in their jackets_

SERVES 4–6

In India we get tiny new potatoes which are about ¾ inch in diameter. They have soft skins and are satiny inside. We cook them in many ways, one of my favorites being a dish in which they are cooked whole with fenugreek greens. Since fenugreek greens are unavailable in this country, I have worked out a substitute dish with Chinese parsley. I have also never been able to find the very tiny potato (except once at Martha's Vineyard), so I just use the regular "new potato" and dice it.

_6–8 medium-sized new potatoes (depending on size)_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1½ inches square, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (optional), or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_1 cup chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1¼ teaspoons salt_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Wash the potatoes well, but do not peel. Quarter them lengthwise, then dice them. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.

Put the ginger in the electric blender with the turmeric and 3 tablespoons water. Blend at high speed until smooth.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the whole cumin seeds, and after about 10 or 20 seconds, when they change color, add the paste from the blender and cook for about 1 minute. Put in the sliced green chili if you are using it, and cook another 30 seconds.

Drain the potatoes and add them to the pot. Fry them, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the pan as you stir. Put in the Chinese parsley, lower heat a bit, and fry another 5 minutes, stirring gently. Add the salt, _garam masala_ , coriander, lemon juice, cayenne pepper if you are using it, and 3 tablespoons warm water. Stir, scrape bottom gently, and cover. Reduce flame to very low and let the potatoes cook about 25 minutes, until done. Stir very gently every 10 minutes or so.

To serve: Lift out carefully and serve in warm shallow dish or platter. Try these potatoes with roast pork or lamb. They are very versatile in an Indian meal and can be served in an all-vegetarian lunch with cabbage, Carrots and Peas with Ginger and Parsley, _Karhi_ , and rice—or they can be served with almost any meat or poultry dish. They are very good with hot _chapatis_ and Tomato and Onion with Lemon Juice.

## _Maya's potatoes_

SERVES 6–8

My sister-in-law makes this dish, so I've named it after her. In India, we take it with us on picnics, heat it on a portable charcoal stove, and eat it with "stale" _pooris_ and hot mango pickle.

_8 medium-sized potatoes_

_Oil for deep frying_

_1 onion, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_4 garlic cloves, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_6 tablespoons oil (or reuse 6 tablespoons strained deep-frying fat)_

_Asafetida (optional), ⅛-inch-square piece or 1 large pinch ground_

_7 fenugreek seeds_

_½ teaspoon fennel seeds_

_¼ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_¼ teaspoon black mustard seeds_

_1 bay leaf_

_3 dried hot red peppers (optional, or use less)_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 medium-sized fresh or canned tomatoes, peeled and chopped_

_1 pinch sugar_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

Boil potatoes, preferably 2 hours ahead, and leave to cool. Just before you begin cooking, peel the potatoes and halve them; quarter them if they are large.

Heat over medium flame 1 to 2 inches of oil in 10–12-inch skillet, wok, or _karhai_ , and fry the potatoes in two or three batches until golden brown on all sides. (If you prefer, you can fry the potatoes in much shallower fat. Just make sure you get them lightly browned on all sides.) Drain and set aside.

Put the chopped onion and garlic into blender with 3 tablespoons water and blend to a paste.

Heat 6 tablespoons of oil in a heavy-bottomed 10–12-inch pot. Keep heat on medium. When very hot, add asafetida, fenugreek seeds, fennel seeds, onion seeds, mustard seeds, bay leaf, and red pepper in this order and in quick succession. Fry 10 to 20 seconds, until bay leaf and chili begin to turn dark. Add paste from blender and turmeric, and fry, stirring, for 5 minutes; then add chopped tomatoes and sugar and cook another 5 minutes. Stir in gently 2 cups water, salt, and fried potatoes, and bring to boil. Cover, lower flame, and simmer 10 minutes. Raise cover, gently lift each potato and turn it over, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes.

To serve: Place each potato gently in a shallow serving dish. Pour the sauce over them and serve with _pooris_ or _parathas_. For a simple meal try _Kheema_ with Fried Onions, _chapatis_ , and this potato dish. It would also go well with a lamb roast and Eggplant _Bharta_ , or you could serve it with Shrimp _Pullao_ and plain yogurt.

## _Maya's potatoes with yogurt_

SERVES 6–8

This is a mild variation on the preceding recipe and is quite delicious.

_4 ounces (½ container) plain yogurt_

_½ teaspoon salt_

Prepare preceding recipe. While it cooks, empty yogurt into a small bowl, add ½ cup cold water and salt, and stir to a smooth paste. Strain it and set aside. When potatoes are done, take them off heat and leave 10 minutes to cool a bit.

Five minutes before serving, pour the yogurt over the potatoes, making sure to distribute it evenly. Stir and mix it in very gently. (The potatoes tend to break a little as you do this, but don't worry!) Now heat the dish. Don't let it boil, or the yogurt will curdle. When heated through, turn flame off.

To serve: Empty potatoes gently into serving bowl and pour sauce over them. Serve with _pooris_ or _parathas_ , a "dry" meat like _Khare Masale Ka Gosht_ , or grilled chicken pieces. You could also have it with _Pullao_ and a cauliflower dish.

## _Potatoes in thick sauce_

SERVES 6

My mother's family in Delhi still lives a stone's throw from Parathe-wali-gulley, the "gulley" or lane where _parathas_ (special Indian breads) are cooked. This narrow lane is flanked on right and left by stalls which have been famous for their _parathas_ for more than a century. Each _paratha_ costs less than 7 cents. And with it you can have as many vegetables and pickles as you like—free! This potato recipe is one of the dishes served there.

_5 medium-sized boiling potatoes (not the crumbly kind)_

_1 piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long, 1 inch thick, and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_6 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 teaspoon whole fennel seed_

_10 fenugreek seeds, whole_

_½ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_½ teaspoon black mustard seeds_

_1–3 whole dried hot red peppers (optional)_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_1½ teaspoons lemon juice_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

Boil the potatoes in their jackets at least 2 hours ahead. Leave to cool.

Put ginger in electric blender along with the coriander, cumin, tomato sauce, and 3 tablespoons warm water. Blend to a paste at high speed.

Peel the cooled potatoes. The charm of this dish is that the potatoes are not cut with a knife; they are broken by hand. Break each potato in half, then in half again, and the larger pieces once again. Each potato should be broken up into about 6 to 8 pieces, depending on its size.

Heat the oil in a 10-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the fennel, fenugreek, onion, and mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to pop (20 seconds or so), put in the red peppers. As they darken, put in the paste from the blender. Fry for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Now put in the pieces of potato and fry another 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1½ cups hot water (from the faucet will do), salt, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower flame, and allow to simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes. The sauce should now be fairly thick.

To serve: Sprinkle with _the garam masala_ , stir, and serve in a warm bowl or dish. This tastes best eaten with most Indian breads—pooris and _parathas_ in particular—but it is also good with plain boiled rice, _Moong Dal_ , and _Kheema_.

## _Potato patties (aloo-ki-tikiya)_

12 PATTIES

These delicious patties are sold on street corners in India pretty much the way candy is sold here. Eaten as snacks or with meals, they consist of mashed potatoes stuffed with lentils and spices.

_6 medium-sized potatoes_

_3 tablespoons yellow split peas (the kind available in supermarkets), soaked overnight in 1 cup cold water and ½ teaspoon salt_

_3 teaspoons salt_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus oil for frying patties_

_5 fenugreek seeds_

_2 tablespoons chopped onion_

_3 tablespoons trimmed, chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_½–1 fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (optional)_

Two hours before dinner, boil the potatoes in their jackets.

While potatoes are boiling, drain split peas. Then boil them in a 1–2-quart pot with 3 cups cold water and ½ teaspoon salt for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and drain in a colander or strainer, shaking it to get out as much water as you can, and invert peas in bowl. Cover the bowl.

In a skillet heat 2 tablespoons oil over a medium flame. When very hot, add the fenugreek seeds, and when they begin to change color (5 to 10 seconds), put in the onions, continuing to fry about 2 minutes until the onions begin to turn brown at the edges. Add the parsley and green chili, and stir another 2 to 3 minutes. Next, put in the drained split peas and ½ teaspoon salt. Keep stirring and cook for about 5 minutes, until all the water has evaporated and the mixture in the skillet seems to become one lump. Cover and set aside.

Peel and mash potatoes with a fork or hand masher. (Do not use a whipping gadget or an electric mixer. Don't add butter.) A few lumps will remain, but don't worry—just get the potatoes as smooth as you can. Add 2 teaspoons salt and mix thoroughly.

To form patties: Divide the mashed potatoes into 12 balls. Divide the split pea mixture into 12 portions. Flatten each potato ball on the palm of your hand, put a portion of the split pea stuffing in the center of it, and cover the stuffing with the mashed potato by bringing the outer circumference to the center. Make a ball again. Flatten it gently to have a patty about 3 inches in diameter. Make all the patties this way, covering them on a platter if you are not going to be eating soon. (You can prepare this much of the recipe from a few hours to a day ahead.)

Cooking these patties is an art in itself. In India they are cooked on a _tava_ , a large, slightly curved iron griddle. If you have a griddle, it is really the ideal utensil to use. If you don't, use a heavy-bottomed skillet, but remember to cook only two or three patties at a time. If you crowd them it becomes difficult to lift and turn them.

Since these patties are cooked like pancakes with very little oil, use only enough to coat the bottom of your skillet or griddle, and heat over medium-low flame. Add a few potato patties and cook them slowly—about 8 to 10 minutes on each side. When one side turns a golden red, carefully work your spatula under it without breaking the hard crust and drop it over on its unfried side. Add another teaspoon of oil, swirling it around. Fry this side for 8 to 10 minutes also, until it has formed a red-brown crust. If the patties brown too quickly, lower the heat.

Note: Since these have to be served hot, and since you may not be able to make many at a time in a skillet, you could use two skillets.

To serve: Place on a heated platter and serve hot. These patties are marvelous for snacks. They are usually served with Tomato Tamarind Chutney, or Fresh Green Chutney with Chinese Parsley and Yogurt.

Or you could serve them as part of any meal. I once cooked a rather pleasant lunch of chicken breasts broiled with just butter, salt, pepper, and lemon. I also made a simple romaine salad and we had these potato patties. It was wonderful!

 he statistics astonish me. They say an average Indian eats one-half to two-thirds of a pound of rice per day whereas the American eats, on an average, about six pounds of rice per year! You may think that the poor Indians eat so much rice because they have nothing better to fill themselves up with. Recently, there was a great shortage of rice in an area of South India, and famine conditions were beginning to prevail. The government offered the people a flour rich with soybean and fish protein as a substitute. The people refused it. They wanted rice. They _liked_ rice. Americans, on the whole, have really not discovered rice. They dismiss rice as a "starch" and as a poor relative of the more popular "starches"—potatoes and pasta. Potatoes can be baked, fried, home-fried, boiled, "duchessed," varied ad infinitum, and there are so many different kinds of pasta... But rice? What can you do with rice? So even when it _is_ served here, more often than not it is cooked unimaginatively and amateurishly. I have seen Americans eat mushy rice without any complaints. I have watched some of the better cooks using precooked and partially cooked rices in recipes. While most Americans are aware of what good roast beef should taste like, few indeed are even conscious of what good rice _is_.

Let us start at the very beginning. What kind of rice should you buy? Looking at the varieties available in the average supermarket, I can more easily tell you what not to buy. Don't buy quick-cooking or "instant" rice. Don't buy parboiled or partially cooked rice. Neither of them really tastes like rice. Also, don't buy prepackaged mixes with herbs and spices. There is no "mix" that you cannot manage better on your own. Once you understand and master the different methods of cooking rice, there is no limit to the number of recipes you can invent.

Buy a long-grain uncooked rice. Carolina rice is good and easily available. If you are lucky enough to be near a specialty store carrying Indian rice, buy _basmati_ rice. This rice is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. It has a narrow, long grain and a very special flavor and smell. The best _basmati_ is aged before it is cooked—and it is cooked only by the rich because it is also very expensive. In the last few years, India, being short of foreign exchange, has been exporting so much of its _basmati_ rice that it is often easier to buy it in New York than it is in New Delhi! But keep the _basmati_ for special occasions.

For most of the recipes in this book, I have used Carolina rice. If you use some other variety, you may have to experiment with the amount of water needed and the cooking time. All uncooked rices are not the same. Where I have used Indian _basmati_ rice, I have indicated how it should be cooked.

Even though India consumes a lot of rice, not all Indians are rice eaters. In fact, the Indians can be divided into the rice eaters and the wheat eaters. While most of South India and Bengal are considered rice-eating areas, Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh are generally conceded to be the wheat-eating areas. During times of grain rationing, each Indian has to declare himself a wheat eater _or_ a rice eater and have a big "W" or "R" stamped on his ration card. This entitles him to get the major portion of his weekly ration in the grain of his choice.

To confuse matters further, there are those Indians, too, who eat both rice _and_ wheat. Even though I come from a wheat-eating area, our family in India ate both rice and wheat bread for lunch, and wheat bread ( _chapatis_ ) for dinner. With the rice and the _chapatis_ , we ate our meat, vegetables, and lentils ( _dals_ ). When rice and wheat breads ( _chapatis, pooris, parathas_ , etc.) are served at the same meal, one is usually served before the other. In our family rice was always served first, but I have eaten in homes where the _chapatis_ were served first.

Most Indians eat rice with their hands. It is mixed with the lentils or meat and vegetables and eaten with the tips of the fingers. Not all the rice is mixed with the rest of the food at once. You serve yourself each dish on a separate part of your plate. The only things you may put on top of your rice are the lentils and other souplike and semiliquid dishes.

Rice can be cooked with almost any meat, vegetable, or fish and served as a main dish. It can be cooked with whole or powdered spices; it can be boiled, steamed, or baked; it can be cooked in water or in aromatic broths. It can be the side dish as in plain boiled rice, or it can be the main course as in _pullao_ and _biryani_. It can be pounded or ground to make desserts like _kheer_ and _phirni_. The visiting physician prescribes it when he leaves with the injunction, "Give her _khitcherie_ and chicken soup." ( _Khitcherie_ , which means "hodge-podge" consists, in this case, of a porridge made of rice and lentils.) The wary tourist with stomach tremors is advised, "Eat nothing but boiled rice and yogurt for a few days!" Every festival, the rice-growing villagers get drunk on their local variety of rice wine—"wine" being a polite word for the rotgut they generally produce.

For important occasions, rice is tinted a bright yellow with turmeric or vegetable coloring or, best of all, saffron, which gives it not just a yellowish orange saffron color but a delicious fragrance as well. I'll never forget my first introduction to saffron. I was in my early teens and on my first visit to Kashmir. We were riding past a hill and valley that were completely purple from all the crocuses growing there. I remarked on their beauty to my Kashmiri companions, who in turn told me that the flowers meant something more than just beauty to them. "This is _zaafraan_ ," they said. _Zaafraan_? I thought. I wondered vaguely why, if this was the saffron flower, it was not saffron-colored. One of the young Kashmiri boys got off his horse, plucked a flower, and brought it to me. He pulled its petals apart, showing me the stigma, which is dried and called saffron, and he told me that thousands of stigmas were needed to get a tablespoon of saffron.

Rice is not used merely for eating, though. It has its place in all the Hindu religious ceremonies; it is thrown into the fire at weddings because it is the great symbol of fertility. My family priest explained it to me this way: "A young girl is like a rice plant. The rice is planted in one field, but it cannot bear fruit until it is transplanted into another field. So it is with the girl. She is born in her father's house, but she cannot bear children until she is transplanted into her husband's house."

There are several methods of cooking rice so that each grain comes out firm and separate, as you will see in the recipes that follow. Rice will always stay warm, left covered, for about 20 minutes after the burner has been turned off.

## _Plain boiled rice_

SERVES 4–6

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_3 cups water_

_1 tablespoon butter_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Combine all the ingredients in a 2–3-quart heavy-bottomed pot with tight-fitting lid. Bring to boil, cover, and turn flame as low as it will go. Leave for 25 to 30 minutes. Lift cover and quickly check to see if rice is cooked through. Turn off heat, and leave lid on until ready to serve.

(When cooking plain boiled rice, I always cook more than I need because there are such wonderful ways of dressing up cooked rice. I cover and refrigerate the leftovers, and cook them for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.)

## _Plain baked rice_

SERVES 6

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_1 tablespoon salt_

_4 tablespoons butter_

Preheat oven to 300°.

Fill a 4-quart pot with about 13 cups of water, add the salt, and set over a high flame.

Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice in a colander.

When the water is boiling, put the rice in it. Bring to a second boil, and boil rapidly for exactly 5 minutes.

Drain the rice by pouring it through a colander.

Put the rice in an ovenproof dish. Cut the butter into 4 patties and place over the rice. Now cut a piece of aluminum foil 2 inches larger than the rim of the dish, cover the dish, and then put the lid on top of the foil. Crinkle foil around the edges to seal as thoroughly as possible. The rice has to cook in its own steam, so that steam must not be allowed to escape.

Place dish in oven for 45 to 50 minutes (check after 45 minutes to see whether rice is done).

## _Plain basmati rice_

SERVES 6

I love the taste of a plain _basmati_ rice eaten with _moong dal_. When I was a child, these two items were always on our luncheon menu—but today, with most of the _basmati_ supply controlled by exporters or black marketeers, even the thought seems extravagant! _Basmati_ is, however, available in American specialty stores, so do buy it and cook it when you can. This method of cooking rice can also be used for any long-grain, fine-quality rice.

_2 cups basmati rice_

_1¼ teaspoons salt_

_1 tablespoon butter_

Wash the rice well in cold water. Soak it in a bowl with 5 cups of water and ½ teaspoon salt for 30 minutes. Then drain.

Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium flame. Pour in the drained rice and stir for a minute. Add 2¼ cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat to _very_ low, and cook for 20 minutes.

Lift lid. Mix rice gently with fork. Cover again and cook another 10 minutes, or until rice is tender.

Serve with almost any dish you like. I love it with _Moong Dal, Pyazwala Khare Masale Ka Gosht_ , lime wedges, and a cucumber relish of some kind.

## _Buttered saffron rice_

SERVES 6

_2 teaspoons leaf saffron, loosely packed,roasted and crumbled_

_2 tablespoons milk_

_1 tablespoon salt_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_4 tablespoons butter_

Preheat oven to 300°.

Soak saffron in warm milk. (I just leave the milk to heat on top of the pilot light area of my stove. You could heat it slightly in a small pot if you like.)

Fill a 4-quart pot with about 13 cups water. Add the salt and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice in a colander.

When the water is boiling, put the rice in it and bring to a second boil. Boil rapidly for exactly 5 minutes.

Drain the rice in a colander.

Put the rice in an ovenproof dish. Pour the saffron milk over it in streaks. Cut the butter into 4 patties and place over the rice. Now cut a piece of aluminum foil 2 inches larger than the rim of the dish. Place foil on top of the dish and put the lid on top of the foil. Crinkle foil around edges to seal.

Place dish in oven for 45 to 50 minutes, checking after 45 minutes to see if the rice is done.

To serve: The rice, when ready to serve, will have saffron-colored streaks in it. Spoon it out onto a large warm platter and serve with any Indian meal. It goes particularly well with Lamb with Spinach, Lamb _Korma_ , and Chicken with Tomato sauce and Butter. Try it also with "Butterflied" Leg of Lamb and with Baked Striped Bass.

## _Basmati rice with spices and saffron_

SERVES 6

Even though this recipe is for Indian _basmati_ rice, any long-grain, fine-quality rice can be used instead.

_1 teaspoon leaf saffron, loosely packed,roasted and crumbled_

_2 tablespoons warm milk_

_2 cups basmati or long-grain rice_

_1¼ teaspoons salt_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_5 cardamom pods_

_2 cinnamon sticks, 2½–3 inches long_

In a small container, soak saffron in warm milk.

Wash the rice well in cold water. Soak it in a bowl with 5 cups water and ½ teaspoon salt for 30 minutes, then drain.

Heat the oil over medium flame in 2–3-quart heavy-bottomed pot (with a tight-fitting lid—to be used later), put in the cardamom pods and cinnamon sticks, and stir a few times. Add the rice, frying and stirring about a minute.

Add 2¼ cups water and ¾ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to _very_ low, and cook for 20 minutes.

Lift off cover. Gently but quickly mix rice with a fork, turning it around a bit. Pour the saffron milk in 2 or 3 streaks over the rice. Cover and keep cookinging another 10 minutes or until rice is quite done.

To serve: Turn the rice onto a platter with a fork (this keeps the grains whole). Serve with Chicken _Moghlai_ and Yogurt with Spinach.

## _Sweet rice_

SERVES 4–6

This is a very simple recipe for sweet rice. It goes rather well with many American dishes, like baked ham, pork chops, roast loin of pork, lamb chops, etc. It is mild flavored and not too sweet. If you like, you could elaborate on the recipe by adding nuts and raisins.

_2½ tablespoons vegetable oil_

_4 whole cloves_

_3–4 whole cardamom pods_

_4 black peppercorns_

_1 bay leaf_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and sliced into fine rings_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_½ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_3 cups homemade beef or lamb stock or canned beef broth (not bouillon)_

_½ teaspoon salt (more if broth is unsalted)_

_1 tablespoon granulated brown sugar_

Over a medium flame, heat the oil in a 2–3-quart heavy-bottomed pot (with a tight-fitting lid—to be used later). When very hot, add the cloves and cardamom pods, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Fry for about 5 seconds, until the spices begin to expand and change color. Now add the onion rings and fry for about 3 to 5 minutes, until the onions turn light brown with darkish edges. Put in the rice, coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and stir for 5 minutes.

Next, pour in the broth and salt, stir, cover, and turn the flame very low. Let cook about 15 minutes.

Lift the lid, put in the brown sugar, and stir quickly with a fork. Cover again and cook another 15 to 20 minutes.

To serve: Serve plain, or garnished with slivered almonds, with _Koftas_ , or Lamb _Korma_ , or with American dishes as suggested above.

## _Sweet rice with carrots and raisins_

SERVES 4–6

In this recipe carrot strips and raisins are fried in butter and then cooked with the rice. I sweeten the rice with 2 tablespoons of sugar, but you could make it sweeter if you like.

_½ pound (2 large) carrots_

_3 tablespoons butter orusli ghee_

_2 tablespoons golden raisins_

_1½ cups long-grain rice_

_2 tablespoons granulated sugar_

_2¾ cups chicken broth (homemade or canned)_

_½ teaspoon salt_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground cardamom seeds (if you keep a pepper grinder for cardamom seeds, use that)_

Cut carrots into julienne strips. I find the easiest way to do this is to cut the carrots diagonally into long, flat slices—the kind that are used in Chinese cooking. Then I cut the slices into strips, doing two or three at a time.

Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Put in the carrot strips and the raisins, and fry, stirring, for 10 to 12 minutes, until the carrots wilt and turn brownish at the edges.

Wash the rice in a colander and leave to drain.

Preheat oven to 300°.

Put the sugar in a 2–3-quart flameproof and ovenproof dish and heat over medium flame. The sugar will melt and then begin to turn brown. As soon as it becomes a golden brown, pour in the chicken broth, keeping face averted. Add the rice, salt, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, and cardamom, and bring to a boil. Keep boiling gently on medium flame for 8 to 10 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed. Stir frequently toward the latter half of cooking time to prevent sticking. Once the liquid is absorbed, turn off the heat. Cover the dish with a piece of aluminum foil 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish. Place the cover on the foil, and crinkle and arrange ends of aluminum foil so that no steam can escape. If you have a very heavy and tight-fitting lid, you can do without the foil.

Place rice dish in the oven and bake for 45 to 60 minutes. Check after 45 minutes to see if rice is done. If not, leave longer.

To serve: Spoon out onto warm platter and serve with Lamb _Korma_ or _Sindhi Gosht_. Any yogurt dish would go well with it.

If you are cooking a Western meal, try eating this rice with roast duck, roast turkey, roast chicken, or baked ham.

## _Sweet rice with carrots and raisins cooked in aromatic broth_

SERVES 4–6

Follow preceding recipe. Instead of chicken broth, use aromatic broth or _yakhni_. This _yakhni_ gives the rice the added flavors of whole cumin and whole fennel seeds. It can be made weeks in advance and stored in the freezer.

## _Rice with whole spices_

SERVES 6

Rice is cooked with whole cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, cloves, black peppers, and cardamom pods. It is a very light and fragrant dish—and easy to make.

_1 medium-sized onion_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_6 whole cloves_

_10 black peppercorns_

_5 cardamom pods_

_2 cinnamon sticks, about 3 inches long_

_3 bay leaves_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Peel onion and slice into fine rounds. Halve the rounds.

Heat the oil in a 3-quart heavy-bottomed pot (with tight-fitting lid—to be used later) over medium heat, put in the onions, and fry, stirring, until they are brown and crisp (but _not_ burned)—about 8 to 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the onions and leave them on a paper towel to drain.

In the same fat, fry the cloves, peppercorns, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and bay leaves for 10 to 20 seconds or until spices begin to expand and change color. Add the rice, and fry, stirring, another minute or two. Now put in 3 cups water and the salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to very low. Cook 25 to 35 minutes, until done. Halfway through the cooking, stir once gently with a fork.

To serve: Spoon out the rice onto a warm platter, breaking any lumps with the back of a slotted spoon. The whole spices serve as a garnish—just warn your family or guests not to bite into them. Sprinkle fried onions over rice.

Serve with baked fish and almost any meat or chicken dish.

## _Rice with peas_

SERVES 4–6

Rice can be cooked with either fresh or frozen peas. In India, of course, it is always cooked with the fresh, hard, shelled variety, but I find that frozen peas work just as well for this dish.

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_3 cups chicken broth (fresh or canned)_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_1 cup shelled peas, fresh or frozen_

Over medium flame, heat the oil in a 3-quart heavy-bottomed pot (with tight-fitting lid—to be used later). When hot, add the mustard seeds and wait until they begin to darken (10 to 20 seconds). Put in the rice, and the peas if you are using fresh ones. Stir for a minute. Add broth and salt. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce flame to very, very low. Leave to cook for 25 to 30 minutes.

If you are using frozen peas, defrost them by placing a cupful in colander and running under hot water. Leave to drain. When rice has cooked 25 minutes, lift cover off and quickly put defrosted peas on top of rice. Replace cover and cook about 5 minutes longer or until done.

To serve: Mix the rice and peas gently and serve on large platter.

This is a relatively bland dish. It goes well with Indian lentils and meats, and equally well with almost any American meat dish.

## _Rice with peas and whole spices_

SERVES 4–6

_2½ tablespoons vegetable oil_

_5 whole cloves_

_5 black peppercorns_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2 inches long_

_4 cardamom pods_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_1 cup shelled peas, fresh or frozen_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Heat oil in a 3-quart heavy-bottomed pot (with tight-fitting lid—to be used later) over medium heat. Add cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, and cardamom. Stir for about 10 to 20 seconds, until spices begin to expand and change color. Add the rice, peas if using fresh ones, coriander, cumin, and turmeric. Stir for 3 minutes. Add 3 cups water and salt, stir again, and bring to a boil. Cover, and turn flame very low. Cook for about 25 to 30 minutes.

If you are using frozen peas, defrost them by placing a cupful in colander and running under hot water. Leave to drain. When rice has cooked 25 minutes, lift cover off and quickly put defrosted peas on top of rice. Replace cover and cook about 5 minutes longer or until done.

To serve: Gently mix the rice and peas and serve on large platter. Warn diners not to bite into the whole spices. This dish tastes good with _Koftas_ , or with Chicken with Sliced Lemon and Fried Onions. Also serve yogurt, plain or with cut-up tomatoes, salt, and pepper.

## _Rice with potatoes and cumin seed_

SERVES 4–6

Rice _and_ potatoes? A double starch? It's not really all _that_ frightening. After all, if you were going to serve yourself a spoonful of rice, you could just as easily serve yourself a spoonful of rice _and_ potatoes. The starch content is about the same, whether you're eating one starch or two, and in America at least the combination has the virtue of novelty.

_2 medium-sized or 1 large potato_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Peel potato, dice into ¾-inch cubes.

Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot (with tight-fitting lid—to be used later) over medium heat. When very hot, add the cumin seeds, and after they have begun to change color and "pop" (about 10 to 20 seconds), put in the potatoes. Let the potatoes brown to a nice golden color on all sides. Then add the rice and stir for about 2 minutes. Add 3 cups water and salt, stir, and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the flame very low, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes. See if rice is done; if not, stir and cook for another 5 minutes.

To serve: Serve with marinated pork chops—or with _Kheema_ and green beans. This is a simple yet very versatile dish that could be served with plain yogurt to an invalid or with _Korma_ at a banquet.

## _Rice with cauliflower and cumin seed_

SERVES 4–6

This dish is very much like the preceding one, only cauliflower is substituted for the potatoes.

_1 small head cauliflower_

_Vegetable oil (enough to have about 1½ inches in cauliflower skillet)_

_Freshly ground pepper_

_2½ tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_Salt_

Break cauliflower into flowerets not bigger than 1½ inches in length and 1 inch in width at the head. Wash and drain flowerets thoroughly on paper towels.

Heat enough oil in skillet, wok, or _karhai_ to have about 1½ inches. Keep on medium flame, much as you would for French fries. When hot, put in the flowerets a batch at a time and deep-fry until they are light brown on all sides and almost cooked through. Leave the insides a bit crunchy. As each batch is done, drain on paper towels, put into a dish, sprinkle with a dash of salt and a crunch of the pepper grinder, and cover.

Heat 2½ tablespoons oil in 3–4-quart heavy-bottomed pot over medium flame. When very hot, stir in the cumin seeds. As soon as they change color (about 10 seconds), add the rice and stir 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups water. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover and turn heat very low. Cook about 25 minutes.

Lift cover off rice pot and quickly (also carefully) lay the flowerets on top of the rice. Cover pot again, and cook about 10 minutes, until cauliflower is heated through.

To serve: Very carefully move all the cauliflower to one side of the pot. Spoon the rice onto a large platter first, then lay the cauliflower on top of the rice.

Serve with any combination of meats, vegetables, and lentils. This again is a very useful and versatile dish that goes well with most American roasts and chops.

## _Rice with spinach_

SERVES 4–6

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_3 teaspoons salt_

_1½ pounds fresh spinach or 2 packages frozen spinach, chopped_

_6 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and finely chopped_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

Wash rice thoroughly in colander. Invert into large bowl, and cover with cold water and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Leave for 2 hours.

Fill a 4–6-quart pot with water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil.

If you are using fresh spinach, trim and wash thoroughly, making sure all the sand is out. Wilt the spinach by dropping it, a little at a time, in the boiling water. As the spinach wilts, remove it to a colander and rinse with cold water. Squeeze the moisture out by pressing between palms of hands, and put on chopping board. When all the spinach is done, chop very finely. ( _Or:_ following package directions, cook frozen spinach until it is just defrosted. Drain, then squeeze out moisture.)

In a 3–4-quart flameproof and ovenproof casserole, heat the oil, add the onions, and sauté on medium flame about 5 minutes. They should just turn golden. Now put in the chopped spinach and _garam masala_. Sauté for about 30 minutes. (This much can be done in advance and the dish left covered for a few hours.)

Preheat oven to 300°.

Drain rice and add to spinach with 2¼ cups water and 1 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Cut aluminum foil to cover top of pot snugly. Cut a hole about ½ inch in diameter in the center of the foil to let the steam escape and the rice dry out. Place foil-covered dish in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes. Check to see if rice is done. If not, leave 5 minutes longer.

To serve: The rice is now ready to serve. If dinner is delayed, turn the oven off and leave rice in it for another 10 minutes.

Even though this dish is best served straight out of the oven, you can, if necessary, cook it 3 or 4 hours earlier. When cooked, leave it out for 5 minutes with foil on. Then cover it with a tight lid, but do not refrigerate. Fifteen minutes before serving reheat it in a preheated 300° oven for 15 minutes.

To serve: Spinach rice can be served plain or garnished with Fried Onion Rings.

For an Indian meal, serve with _Koftas, Seekh Kababs_ , Lamb _Korma_ , Chicken Cutlets, or Eggs _Moghlai_. Serve a yogurt dish with it and a vegetable, cauliflower or carrots. As for an American meal, we tried it recently with liver, bacon, and grilled tomatoes, and it was wonderful. It is also good with lamb chops or a lamb or beef roast. This is an excellent dish to impress guests with-because it tastes very good and looks spectacular.

## _Rice with spinach cooked in aromatic broth_

SERVES 4–6

This dish is very much like the preceding recipe, Rice with Spinach, except that instead of cooking the rice in water, it is cooked in _yakhni_ , a deliciously flavored beef broth. (Another _yakhni_ recipe, using pieces of lamb; is given as part of the _pullao_ recipe.)

Follow the preceding recipe, adding 2¼ cups of the following flavored beef broth instead of water:

YAKHNI

_2½ cups canned or homemade beef broth (not bouillon)_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled_

_7 whole cloves_

_4 whole cardamom pods_

_2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2½–3 inches long_

_6 black peppercorns_

_1 bay leaf_

Put the beef broth into a pot with a lid. Tie onion, garlic, cloves, cardamom, fennel, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, peppercorns, and bay leaf in cheesecloth and drop in pot. Bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat low, and allow to simmer for half an hour. Remove the cheesecloth, squeezing out most of the liquid it holds.

When using the broth, measure to make sure you have 2¼ cups. If a little less, add water to make 2¼ cups.

If broth is already salted, use only ½ teaspoon salt when adding spinach to rice and broth.

Serve as in preceding recipe.

## _Rice with frozen black-eyed peas_

SERVES 4–6

_10-ounce package frozen black-eyed peas_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_7 whole cloves_

_7 black peppercorns_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Either take out the package of frozen black-eyed peas an hour before cooking and defrost just enough so the peas separate, or cover with water in a pot, bring to boil, and simmer just until the peas separate. Drain.

In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot, heat oil over medium heat. When hot, add cloves and peppercorns and fry until they expand (10 to 20 seconds). Put in the rice and black-eyed peas and fry for 5 minutes. Add the _garam masala_ , salt, and 3 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, lower flame to very low, and leave for 35 minutes. Lift cover to see if rice is done. If not, cover and cook another 5 minutes. Turn flame off. Covered rice will stay warm 15 to 20 minutes.

To serve: Place on a warm platter, gently breaking lumps with back of large spoon. Garnish with Fried Onion Rings if desired, or serve plain.

For Western meals try serving this with pork or lamb roasts and chops. It is also good with roast duck. Or try it with a German or Polish sausage accompanied with grilled tomatoes and mustard or beet greens!

For an Indian meal, have it with Pork Chops Cooked with Whole Spices and Tamarind Juice. Serve some kind of yogurt dish with it.

## _Rice with yellow split peas_

SERVES 4

_½ cup yellow split peas_

_4 teaspoons salt_

_1 cup long-grain rice_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2–4 small white boiling onions, peeled_

_3 tablespoons butter_

Soak split peas in 1½ cups cold water and leave for an hour, then drain.

Bring 3 cups of water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil. When the water is boiling rapidly, drain the split peas and put them in. Boil rapidly for 6 to 7 minutes, and drain.

In a 4-quart pot bring 12 cups of water and 3 teaspoons salt to a rolling boil, put in the drained rice, and boil rapidly for 5 minutes. Drain.

Preheat oven to 300°.

In a 3–4-quart flameproof and ovenproof dish, heat the oil over medium heat. When hot, put in the cumin seeds and fry for 10 to 20 seconds, until they begin to change color. Add the onions, rolling them around once, then add the drained rice and the drained split peas and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.

Cut the butter into 3 patties and place on top of rice. Cut a sheet of aluminum foil 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish. Cover dish with it. Place the lid on top. Now crinkle the protruding aluminum around the edges to seal them. Place dish in oven for 45 to 60 minutes. Check after 45 minutes and leave longer only if not yet done.

To serve: Spoon out onto warm platter and serve with _Kheema_ and Yogurt with Tiny Dumplings, or with any other meat and vegetable combination you like.

## _Leftover rice with mushrooms_

SERVES 4

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and finely chopped_

_6–8 medium-sized mushrooms, cleaned and chopped (approximately ¼-inch squares)_

_½–1 fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (optional)_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_2 cups plain leftover cooked rice (with salt)_

_3–4 tablespoons canned beef broth, chicken broth, or water_

_¼ teaspoon salt (more as needed)_

Heat oil in 10–12-inch skillet on medium flame. Add first the onions and mushrooms, frying and stirring continuously, then after 3 to 4 minutes the sliced green chili, after another minute the coriander and cumin, and finally the rice, breaking any lumps there may be with the back of a slotted spoon.

Cook for 5 minutes, then put in 3 tablespoons of broth or water and the salt. Stir again, cover, lower heat, and cook for 5 minutes. Lift cover, and if rice seems to be sticking at the bottom of the skillet, add another tablespoon of broth or water. Allow the rice to heat through, covered, for another 5 minutes or so.

To serve: If serving this with a Western meal, you could omit the coriander and green chili. The dish goes very well with ham, pork roasts, and roast beef. Try it with bacon and eggs for breakfast or brunch. It is unusual and very good. If you are cooking this as part of an Indian meal, serve it with a simple meat like _Khare Masale Ka Gosht_. You could also serve it with Sweetbreads with Chinese Parsley. Serve some yogurt dish as well.

## _Shrimp pullao_

SERVES 6

This _pullao_ can be cooked with shrimp or with any firm-fleshed fish like cod or halibut (see following recipe).

_¾ pound fresh shrimp_

_3 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

_½–1 fresh hot green chili, finely sliced (optional)_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 medium-sized onion_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

Peel and devein shrimp.

In a tea cup, mix 1 tablespoon warm water, the chopped parsley, turmeric, _garam masala_ , ½ teaspoon salt, the lemon juice, and green chili.

Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in the contents of the cup and fry, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the shrimp, and on a medium flame fry them with the spices for about 4 minutes.

With a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp to a covered dish, leaving the sauce behind. Pour I cup warm water into the skillet and scrape up all the spices stuck to the bottom and sides, turning up the heat if necessary. Then turn heat off.

Peel the onion and cut it into fine rounds. Cut the rounds in half.

In a heavy-bottomed 3–4-quart pot, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Put in the sliced onions, and fry them 3 to 4 minutes until the edges begin to turn brown. Now add the rice, 2 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, and the liquid from the frying pan. Stir and bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to very low. Cook for 25 minutes.

Lift the cover off the saucepan and add the shrimp. Mix quickly with a fork and cover again. Cook another 10 minutes.

To serve: Serve with Cabbage with Onions and any yogurt side dish—Yogurt with Roasted Eggplant would be especially good.

## _Halibut or cod pullao_

SERVES 6

Follow the preceding recipe, only substitute halibut or cod for the shrimp. Buy ¾ pound cod or halibut steaks or fillets. Make sure they are at least ½ to ¼ inch thick. Cut the steaks or fillets into strips, each at least _1½ to 2_ inches long and about 1 inch wide.

To serve: Lift rice and fish gently out of pan and place on warm platter. You could serve it with _Moong Dal_ , yogurt, and Chicken with Tomato Sauce and Butter.

## _Chicken biryani_

SERVES 6–8

_Biryani_ is perhaps one of our most elaborate rice dishes. Of Moghul origin, it is cooked with lamb or chicken, streaked with saffron, and garnished with raisins and nuts. The chicken is first marinated for at least 2 hours in a delicious paste of ginger, garlic, onions, yogurt, lemon juice, and spices. It is then cooked briefly. Partially cooked rice is placed over it, and the chicken and rice are allowed to steam for about an hour.

_6 medium-sized onions_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_10 whole cloves_

_20 whole black peppercorns_

_Seeds from 8 whole cardamom pods_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon whole poppy seeds_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_4½ teaspoons salt_

_3 tablespoons lemon juice_

_8 ounces (1 container) plain yogurt_

_8 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 bay leaves_

_4 large black cardamoms, if available_

_2 pounds chicken legs and breasts_

_2 teaspoons leaf saffron, loosely packed,roasted and crumbled_

_2 tablespoons milk_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

GARNISH

_2 tablespoons golden raisins, fried_

_2 tablespoons blanched almonds_

_2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced or quartered lengthwise_

First you have to make the marinade for the chicken.

Peel and coarsely chop 3 of the onions.

Place chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in an electric blender, along with the cloves, peppercorns, the seeds only from the 8 cardamoms, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, poppy seeds, mace, 1½ teaspoons salt, and the lemon juice. Blend all of these at high speed until you have a smooth paste. Place this paste in a large bowl. Add the yogurt and mix well.

Now peel the 3 remaining onions. Slice them into very fine rings, and halve all the rings.

In a 10-inch heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the oil over medium flame. When hot, add the bay leaves and 4 black cardamoms. Fry for about 10 to 15 seconds. Now put in the onions and fry them, stirring, for about 10 minutes or until they get brown and crisp (but _not_ burned). Remove them carefully with a slotted spoon, squeezing out as much of the oil as possible. Reserve all the onion-flavored oil, the black cardamoms, and the bay leaves. You will need them later. Mix in two-thirds of the fried onions with the marinade paste. Place the rest on a paper towel to drain. Set aside for garnishing.

Remove skin from the chicken legs and breasts. Cut the legs into two pieces each (drumstick and thigh), and quarter all the breasts. Pierce the chicken pieces with a fork and place in the bowl with the marinade paste. Mix well. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Turn occasionally.

After 2 hours (or more), remove the bowl from the refrigerator and place all its contents in a 3–4-quart heavy-bottomed pot. Bring slowly to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove only the chicken pieces, place them in a 5-quart casserole dish, and cover. Set aside. On a medium flame, boil down the marinade paste, stirring, until you have about 9 to 10 tablespoons left. Spoon the paste over the chicken. Cover again.

Preheat oven to 300°.

Soak the saffron in 2 tablespoons hot (not boiling) milk.

Bring about 13 cups of water with 3 teaspoons of salt to a boil in a 4-quart pot, then add the rice. After it has come to a boil again, cook 5 minutes, timing very carefully (the rice must not cook through). Drain the rice in a colander, then place it on top of the chicken in the casserole. Pour the saffron milk over the rice, streaking it with orange lines. Spoon out the onion-flavored oil from the pan, reserving a level tablespoon to fry the raisins if you like. Sprinkle the oil, cardamom, and bay leaves over the rice. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil, cut 2 inches wider than the rim of the dish. Now put the lid on and use the protruding foil edges to seal the dish as best you can by crinkling it and pushing it against the sides. Bake 1 hour.

Garnishes: There are several garnishes that can be used for _biryani;_ you can use them all, or only what you like, but the fried onions are a must. If you wish to use raisins, you can fry them in a tablespoon of the onion-flavored oil just after you have fried the onions.

To serve: As you lift the cover off your casserole dish, you will see beautiful saffron streaks on the white rice. Spoon the rice and chicken out onto a large platter. Sprinkle fried onions and other garnishes of your choice over, and serve hot. With _biryani_ , serve _Koftas_ and some yogurt dish—Yogurt with Tiny Dumplings, or Yogurt with Potatoes. If you wish to serve a vegetable, Cauliflower with Ginger and Chinese Parsley would be very good.

_Biryani_ is quite definitely not an everyday dish. It is served at weddings and important dinners. Try serving it at a late supper party. It was, and is, a dish worthy of a king.

## _Pullao (rice with lamb)_

SERVES 6

In my father's household, Sunday lunches were always rather special, as this was the only lunch we all ate together. Our family was divided into two camps: there was the group headed by my father that liked _pullao_ for Sunday lunch, and there was the second group (to which I belonged), headed rather timidly by my mother, which preferred _karhi_ and plain boiled rice. My mother, being very diplomatic, alternated these dishes. But also, being as awed by my father as the rest of us, she alternated the dishes in my father's favor, so we ended up by eating more _pullao_ than _karhi_. And if I complained and said, "But it was our turn to have _karhi_ this Sunday," my mother would say, "Oh, dear, I completely forgot. You can have it next week!" "Hmmm," I would think, "cheated again!" But, strange as it may seem, as I have grown older, I have begun to love _pullao_. I don't know why. The pleasures of one's palate do change—or perhaps it's the memory of my father, sitting at the head of the table, the _pullao_ in front of him, surveying his wife and six children and feeling good and at peace.

Here is my mother's recipe for _pullao_ , a dish of rice and meat cooked in flavored broth. In India, the meat that is traditionally used for the dish is goat ribs, cut up in pieces about 1½ to 2 inches in length. The meat is a little fatty, more bone and less meat. Rib meat in America tends to be very fatty. So I would suggest you use one of two kinds of meat: if you like meat pieces with bone, ask the butcher to chop up 2½ pounds of shoulder or neck of lamb into 1½-inch cubes. If you are trying this recipe for the first time and don't want to be bothered with bones, get 1½ pounds of meat off a leg of lamb and ask the butcher to cut it into 1-inch cubes. (I usually buy a whole leg of lamb and get some cut off into chops and some boned and cut into cubes. You can freeze what you don't need.) I find that most Americans prefer the boned, cubed meat. However, remember that traditionally _pullao_ uses meat with bone and that _some_ day, if not _today_ , you should try making it that way.

_4 cups canned or homemade beef broth (not bouillon)_

_1½ pounds of meat from leg of lamb cut into 1-inch cubes, or 2½ pounds of meat and bone from neck and shoulder of lamb, cut into 1½-inch cubes_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1-inch cube, peeled_

_20 black peppercorns_

_6 large black cardamom pods (if available), or 14 small or greenish-yellow pods_

_2 teaspoons whole cumin seeds_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2½–3 inches long_

_2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds_

_2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds_

_4 bay leaves_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_2 cups long-grain rice_

To make the _yakhni_ , or flavored broth: In a 4-quart pot, put the beef broth and the pieces of lamb. Tie up in a piece of cheesecloth 1 peeled onion, the garlic cloves, the piece of ginger, the peppercorns, 4 of the black cardamoms or 10 of the small cardamom pods, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, the cinnamon stick, the coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and bay leaves. Drop the cheesecloth into the pot with the beef broth. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Skim off the surface scum. Cover, reduce heat to low, and allow to simmer slowly for 35 minutes.

While the broth is simmering, cut the other peeled onion in half lengthwise. Now slice it finely into half-circles.

In a 10-inch skillet heat the oil over a medium flame. Add the onion slices and fry until they are a crisp dark brown (about 10 minutes). Don't burn them—adjust flame if necessary. Remove with a slotted spoon, draining the fat back into the skillet. Spread onions on paper towels and set aside for later use. Turn flame under skillet off, leaving its residue of fat.

When the broth is made, fish out the cheesecloth, squeeze it slightly so as not to lose any flavors, and discard. Strain the broth and set aside. Reserve the meat in the strainer.

Heat the onion skillet again over a medium-high flame. When hot, add remaining 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds and either 2 large black cardamom pods or 4 small green ones. Fry for about 20 seconds or until the spices begin to expand and change color. Now add the drained meat and fry for 3 to 5 minutes or until the meat is lightly browned on all sides.

In a 4–6-quart pot put 1 cup of the uncooked rice, half the meat, then the second cup of rice, and the rest of the meat. Measure the flavored broth; pour 3½ cups of it over the rice. If you have less (you shouldn't), add a little water. Put in 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Cover, turn flame very, very low, and leave for 20 minutes. Lift cover and stir gently with a fork; cover again and cook another 20 minutes until rice is done. (If upper layer is still uncooked, stir gently with a fork, cover again, and cook 10 minutes longer.) Turn heat off and leave covered on stove until ready to serve.

To serve: Arrange the _pullao_ on a large platter. Crumble the browned onions and sprinkle all over rice. Serve with plain yogurt or Yogurt with Potatoes. Also serve a vegetable—perhaps a cauliflower dish—and a salad (tomato, onion, and cucumber salad).

Remember that this rice dish will stay hot for 20 to 25 minutes after it is cooked if you leave it covered on the stove. Also, after the rice is cooked, it is best to give the steam 5 to 10 minutes to settle before you serve.

## _Fried onion rings for garnishing_

_Vegetable oil, enough to have at least 1 inch in pan_

_1 medium-sized onion_

Heat oil in small skillet over medium heat. Peel onion and slice very finely. Wipe onion rings with paper towels and drop into heated fat. As they fry, separate rings with slotted spoon. Fry until rich brown (they should be a rich dark brown without being burned!). Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. (This can be done ahead of time and the garnish left uncovered in a saucer.) Arrange onion rings over rice or meats.

SEE ALSO:

_Dal soup_

 _als—_ lentils or pulses—are varieties of dried beans and peas. In some form or other they are eaten daily in almost every Indian home, frequently providing the poor with their only source of protein. While people in England and America speak of making their living as earning their "bread and butter," Indians who earn a bare wage complain that they make just enough for their " _dal roti_ " ( _roti_ is bread).

Both the rice eaters and the wheat eaters of India consume _dal_ with equal enthusiasm. Each state, however, cooks its _dals_ in a completely different way. Punjab excels in whole, unhulled _dals_ —whole _urad_ and _rajma_ cooked slowly in the clay oven _(tandoor)_ , as well as in _chana bhatura_ , a spicy dish of chickpeas eaten with puffy deep-fried bread. The fussy _Delhi-wallahs_ like the hulled and split _moong dal_ , delicately spiced with cumin and sprinkled with lime juice and browned onions. In Bombay, a hot, sweet and sour _toovar dal_ is made by the addition of tamarind paste and jaggery (a dry, lump variety of molasses) to the cooked _dal_. In Madras, the scorchingly spicy _dal_ often contains vegetables—eggplant, okra, or tomatoes.

In America and England, where a very thin, liquidlike _dal_ is often served in Indian and Pakistani restaurants, people have come to the conclusion that _dal_ is a soup. Well, it isn't; one of North India's favorite expressions, "Dey dal may pani" (put water in the _dal)_ , refers to foods that are diluted in order to stretch them out among more people, a practice which is, naturally, deplored. A well-cooked _dal_ is generally quite thick. It is hard to describe the exact consistency: it is thinner than a cooked cereal, but not quite as thin as pea soup. Having made that generalization, let me add that in some _dal_ recipes the grains stay dry and almost whole, while in others, particularly some cooked in southern India, the _dal_ is indeed quite soupy.

_Dal_ is always eaten with rice or Indian breads. It can be poured over rice, especially when it is thin, or placed beside the rice, or half can be poured over the rice and the rest beside it on the plate. This way it can be eaten with the rice or with other vegetables. It leaves more options open, and is the way I prefer to do it. _Dals_ can also be served in _katoris_ which can be placed on the plates. This is the best method if you are serving _dal_ with breads.

What gives _dal_ dishes their final flavor or pep is the _tarka_ , or _baghar_ or _chhownk_. This does to the _dal_ what a _rouille_ does to a fish soup in the south of France. It makes it come alive! You can "give a _tarka_ " of whole mustard seeds or cumin seeds or fenugreek seeds, or of asafetida _and_ cumin seeds, or of browned onions and ginger, and so on. Basically what happens is that oil or shortening (in India it is _ghee_) is heated in a small pan or skillet. Whole spices are added, and the _ghee_ and spices are then poured over the cooked _dal_.

Here is a list of the commonly used _dals;_ you should learn to recognize them by their shape and color.

MOONG DAL | Hulled and split: small, yellow, rectangular grains; unhulled and whole: small, green, cylindrical grain, called mung beans in health food stores.  
---|---  
URAD DAL | Hulled and split: small, off-white rectangular grains; unhulled and whole: small, black, cylindrical grain.  
CHANA DAL | Hulled and split: round, yellow grain, larger than _moong dal_. This _dal_ is of the chickpea family.  
ARMAR OR TOOVAR DAL | Hulled and split: round, dull yellow grain, slightly larger than _chana dal_ and often with irregular edges.  
RAJMA | Whole and unhulled: red kidney bean, which comes in a medium and small size.  
MASOOR DAL | Hulled and split: very tiny, round, shiny salmon-colored grains that turn yellow when cooked.  
KALA CHANA | Whole and unhulled: small black chickpeas.  
CHHOLA OR KABLI CHANA | Whole: chickpeas or garbanzos.  
LOBHIA | Whole: black-eyed peas.

In this chapter, I have also included recipes for the _dals_ available in your supermarket (lentils, frozen black-eyed peas, canned chickpeas) and for dishes made with ground chickpea flour _(Karhi_) and ground _urad dal (Baris_).

WASHING AND CLEANING DALS

All _dals_ , with the exception of those packaged in America and usually bought in supermarkets, are usually very dirty. First, they have to be _picked_ clean. Dishonest wholesalers and retailers have long made it a thriving practice to add tiny stones, often the same color as the _dal_ , to boost the weight. Also, occasionally, you will find a few discolored or deformed grains that need to be removed, or there may be stalks, twigs, and what-have-you's lurking around. The best way to remove this is to put the amount of _dal_ you wish to cook at one end of a large platter. Now slide 10 or 15 grains at a time to the other end of the same platter, spotting and removing all unwanted objects as you do so. Keep your hawk's eyes open because there is nothing worse than crunching a stone as you eat your dinner! Next, the _dal_ must be washed several times in cold water to remove any dust that may be clinging to the grains. Now you are ready to cook it.

## _Lentils_

SERVES 6–8

This is a recipe for the dry lentils as bought in an American supermarket.

_2 cups lentils_

_1 cinnamon stick, 2–3 inches long_

_1 bay leaf_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled_

_2 slices fresh, peeled ginger, ⅛ inch thick, not more than 1 inch in diameter_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¾ lemon_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil orusli ghee_

_A pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

Wash the lentils. Drain.

In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot, combine the lentils, 6 cups water, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, garlic cloves, ginger slices, and turmeric. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently until tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Slice lemon into 5 or 6 rounds. Remove seeds. Lift cover of pot and put in the lemon slices, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Stir. Cover and simmer another 5 minutes.

Just before serving, heat the vegetable oil in a 4–6-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When very hot, put in the asafetida and the cumin seeds. As soon as the asafetida begins to sizzle and expand, and the cumin seeds darken, pour the contents of skillet over the lentils and stir.

To serve: Serve the lentils with rice or any of the breads. A meat, chicken, or fish dish and a vegetable would complete the meal.

## _Frozen black-eyed peas (lobhia)_

SERVES 6

_2 packets (10 ounces each) frozen black-eyed peas_

_1½–2 teaspoons salt_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_A generous pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1½ medium-sized onions, peeled and chopped_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_1 cup tomato sauce_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_3 tablespoonstamarind paste or 2 tablespoons lemon juice_

In a 3–4-quart pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the frozen black-eyed peas and ½ teaspoon salt. Bring to a second boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer peas gently for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside, covered.

In another 3–4-quart, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the asafetida and the cumin seeds. As soon as the asafetida expands and sizzles and the cumin seeds darken (this will take a few seconds), put in the chopped onions. Fry onions, stirring, for 7 or 8 minutes, or until they are lightly browned. Add the turmeric, coriander, and cumin, and cook, stirring, another minute. Put in the tomato sauce, lower heat, and simmer 5 minutes, stirring now and then.

Add the black-eyed peas, ¼ cup water, the rest of the salt (1–1½ teaspoons), the cayenne, and the tamarind paste. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 20 to 35 minutes. Lift off cover, and if there is any extra sauce, turn up heat and boil it down, stirring. All the sauce must adhere to the peas.

To serve: This versatile dish can be served with pork or lamb roasts as well as with almost any Indian meal.

## _Chana masaledar_

SERVES 6

Chickpeas are cooked with onion, garlic, ginger, and the _garam_ (hot) spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. This is a traditional "snack" dish from the state of Punjab.

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ½ inch square, peeled and grated_

_1 tablespoon tomato paste_

_20-ounce can of chickpeas (garbanzos)_

_½ teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional—use as desired)_

_½–¾ teaspoon ground amchoor, or 1 tablespoon lemon juice_

GARNISH

_1 firm tomato, washed and quartered_

_1 medium-sized onion, halved and cut into coarse slivers_

_4 fresh hot green chilies (only if someone is going to eat them; otherwise use 4 long slices of a green pepper)_

Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed 10-inch skillet over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the whole cumin seeds. As soon as they begin to darken, after a few seconds, add the chopped onions. Stir and fry 7 to 8 minutes or until onions begin to turn a golden brown.

Turn heat to low and add the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and coriander. Mix, add the garlic and ginger, and fry, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste.

Open chickpea can and drain out most of the liquid, leaving about 2 tablespoons. Pour this and the chickpeas into the skillet. Add salt, cayenne, and _amchoor_ or lemon juice. Mix well, cover, and let the chickpeas cook with the spices for about 10 minutes. Stir gently every now and then, taking care not to break chickpeas.

To serve: Traditionally, the _chanas_ (chickpeas) are placed in a bowl lined around the edge with quartered tomatoes, raw onion slivers, and green chilies, and then eaten with _bhaturas_. I have served them with _pooris_ as well as with rice. A meal with Chicken _Moghlai_ , Shrimp, Kerala Style, and these chickpeas as well as Cucumber _Raita_ served with plain rice is very nice. The dish can be prepared a day in advance, covered, and refrigerated. Reheat gently over a low flame.

## _Canned chickpeas with garlic and ginger_

SERVES 6

_10 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, peeled and chopped_

_5 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_A pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_¼ cup tomato sauce_

_20-ounce can chickpeas (garbanzos), drained_

_4 medium-sized potatoes, freshly boiled and peeled_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (less if desired)_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Put the garlic and ginger into the container of an electric blender. Add 4 tablespoons water and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat oil in large skillet or 10-inch heavy-bottomed pot over a medium flame. When hot, put in the asafetida. After a few seconds, as soon as it sizzles and expands, pour in the paste from the blender, keeping face averted, and add the turmeric; after a minute add the tomato sauce, pour in 1 cup water, and add the drained chickpeas. Quarter the potatoes and add them as well. Put in the salt, black pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil. Cover. Lower heat and simmer gently for 20 minutes.

To serve: These chickpeas taste best with some kind of Indian bread _—pooris, parathas_ , or _bhaturas_. Serve yogurt or cucumber relishes as an accompaniment. Any meat or chicken dish would go with this dish too.

## _Moong dal_

SERVES 6

This is North India's most popular _dal_ , and it is eaten with equal relish by toothless toddlers, husky farmers, and effete urban snobs. The simple recipe given below can be used for the white _urad dal_ , the salmon-colored _masoor dal_ , and the large _arhar_ or _toovar dal_ as well.

_1½ cups moong dal (hulled and split)_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled_

_2 slices peeled fresh ginger, 1 inch square and ⅛ inch thick_

_1 tablespoon chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 tablespoon ground turmeric_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_1½ tablespoons lemon juice_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil orusli ghee_

_A pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_Lemon or lime wedges_

Clean and wash _dal_ thoroughly. Put _dal_ in heavy-bottomed 3–4-quart pot, add 5 cups water, and bring to a boil. Remove the froth and scum that collects at the top. Now add the garlic, ginger, parsley, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar, lower heat, and simmer gently for about 1½ hours. Stir occasionally. When _dal_ is cooked, add the salt and lemon juice (it should be thicker than pea soup, but thinner than cooked cereal).

In a 4–6-inch skillet or small pot, heat the vegetable oil or _ghee_ over a medium-high flame. When hot, add the asafetida and cumin seeds. As soon as the asafetida sizzles and expands and the cumin seeds turn dark (this will take only a few seconds), pour the oil and spices over the _dal_ and serve. (Some people put the _dal_ in a serving dish and then pour the oil and spices over it.)

To serve: Serve with plain rice, _Kheema_ , and a vegetable for a simple meal. Most meat and chicken dishes go well with this _dal_. Since some people like to squeeze extra lemon or lime juice on their _dal_ , serve some wedges separately. Note: Finely sliced onion rings, fried until brown and crisp are often spread over the _dal_ as a garnish before it is served.

## _Kala chana aur aloo (black chickpeas with potatoes)_

SERVES 4

This is one of my favorite lunch dishes. India produces several varieties of chickpeas. _Kala chana_ are small and black. They need to be cleaned and soaked in water for 24 hours before cooking. I use tamarind paste to give this dish a tart taste, but you could use lemon juice instead.

_1 cup black chickpeas (kala chana)_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_½ teaspoon baking soda_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped_

_3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger about 1 inch square, peeled and chopped_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_A generous pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_4 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and quartered_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_¼ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1 teaspoon garam masala_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_3–4 tablespoonstamarind paste, or 2 tablespoons lemon juice_

Sort and clean the chickpeas and wash them under cold water. Drain. Soak for 24 hours in a bowl containing ½ teaspoon of the salt, the baking soda, and a quart of water.

Place chopped onion, garlic, and ginger in the container of an electric blender with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. When very hot, put in the asafetida and the cumin seeds. After a few seconds, when the asafetida expands and the cumin darkens, put in the paste from the blender, keeping face averted. Fry, stirring, for about 5 minutes.

Now drain the chickpeas and add them to the pot. Also put in the potatoes, coriander, turmeric, _garam masala_ , 1 teaspoon salt, the cayenne pepper, and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Cover, and allow to simmer gently for I hour.

Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of tamarind paste or lemon juice (you could use more or less) to chickpeas according to tartness desired. Stir. Check salt. Cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

To serve: This dish tastes very good with _hot pooris_ or _parathas_. Some kind of relish—perhaps Cucumber and Tomato with Lemon Juice—should be served with it. For a more complete meal add meat and a green vegetable dish.

## _Masoor or arhar dal with vegetables_

SERVES 6–8

_2 cups masoor or arhar (toovar) dal (hulled and split)_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric powder_

_3 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_Any one of the following vegetables:  
3 medium-sized zucchini, washed and sliced in rounds   
or 2 medium-sized yellow squash, washed and sliced in rounds   
or ½ pound mushrooms, cleaned and sliced   
or 1 medium-sized eggplant, washed and cut in ¾-inch cubes   
or 1 medium-sized onion, cut in half, sliced, and sautéed for 5 minutes in 3 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_4 tablespoonstamarind paste_

_½ teaspoon sugar_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil orusli ghee_

_10 whole black peppercorns_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_10 whole fenugreek seeds_

_10 white urad dal grains (optional)_

_1–3 whole dried hot red peppers_

Clean and wash _dal_.

Put _dal_ in 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot with 6 cups water and bring to boil. If there is any scum, remove it with a spoon. Add the turmeric and parsley and cover. Lower heat and simmer gently until tender, about 1½ hours, stirring every 15 minutes or so. Add the salt, the vegetables you are using, tamarind paste, and sugar. Cook another 15 minutes or until vegetable is tender.

In a 4–6-inch skillet, heat the 3 tablespoons of oil or _ghee_ over medium-high heat. When hot, put in the peppercorns, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, _urad dal_ , and lastly the red peppers. When the mustard seeds begin to pop and the fenugreek and red pepper darken (this should take just a few seconds), pour the contents of skillet into the pot containing _dal_ and vegetables. Stir. Cover again and turn off heat.

To serve: Serve with plain rice and any meat, chicken, or fish dish of your choice.

## _Cold chana dal with potatoes_

SERVES 4

In this dish the _chana dal_ is first boiled and then mixed with diced boiled potatoes, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, roasted cumin, and lemon juice. If you like, you can slice scallion rounds and add them as well. It is served at room temperature or, if you wish, just very slightly chilled.

_½ cup chana dal,cleaned and washed_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_3 peeled slices fresh ginger, about 1 inch in diameter and ⅛ inch thick_

_4 new potatoes, boiled and diced into ½–inch cubes_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_1 teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice, or 3 tablespoonstamarind paste_

Put the _dal_ to boil with 3 cups of water, ½ teaspoon salt, and the ginger slices. Cover. Simmer gently for 1 hour. Drain. Discard ginger slices.

In a serving bowl, combine the _dal, 14_ teaspoon salt, and the remaining ingredients. Mix well.

To serve: Serve with lamb roast or pork chops. Indians often eat this as a snack, at tea time.

## _Hot chana dal with potatoes_

SERVES 4

This is a hot (i.e., not cold) version of the preceding recipe.

_½ cup chana dal,cleaned and washed_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_¼ teaspoon black mustard seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_10 fenugreek seeds_

_2 fresh green chilies (as an alternative, use ⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper)_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ¾ inch square, peeled and grated_

_4 new potatoes, boiled and diced into ½-inch cubes_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice, or 3 tablespoonstamarind paste_

Put the _dal_ to boil with 3 cups of water and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 1 hour. Drain and set aside.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the mustard, cumin, and fenugreek seeds. In a few seconds, as soon as the cumin and fenugreek seeds darken and the mustard seeds begin to pop, add the green chilies. Turn them over once (this will take another second), then put in the chopped onion and grated ginger. Stir and fry the onions for 4 to 5 minutes. Now put in all the remaining ingredients, i.e., the boiled _dal_ and diced potatoes, ½ teaspoon salt, the pepper, cayenne, if you are using it, and lemon juice or tamarind paste. Mix well and cook over medium flame for 5 minutes, stirring frequently but gently.

To serve: Serve with _chapatis, bhaturas_ , or _parathas_ and a yogurt relish. Any meat, chicken, or fish dish can be served with it as well.

## _Chana dal cooked with lamb_

SERVES 6

I use meat from shoulder of lamb for this recipe, but you could use leg of lamb or stewing beef. The _chana dal_ cooks in an hour, or a bit less, so you will have to adjust the time when you put it in. If you use stewing lamb or beef, cook the meat for 1½ hours and _then_ add the _dal_.

_2–2½ pounds boned meat from shoulder of lamb, cut into 1–1½-inch cubes_

_5 medium-sized onions (1 peeled and chopped, 4 halved and sliced into fine half-rings)_

_5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 1 inch cube, peeled and chopped_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 tablespoon ground coriander_

_2 teaspoons ground cumin_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_3 tablespoons tomato sauce_

_¼ teaspoon ground mace_

_¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg_

_¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_¼ teaspoon ground cloves_

_1½ teaspoons salt (or as desired)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_¼–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_¾ cupchana dal, cleaned and washed_

_2 tablespoons lemon juice_

GARNISH

_3 tablespoons chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

Pat the meat pieces dry with a paper towel. Set aside.

Put the 1 chopped onion, garlic, and ginger into container of an electric blender. Add 4 tablespoons water and blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

Heat the oil in a 10-inch heavy-bottomed casserole-type pot, over medium-high flame. Put in the 4 sliced onions and fry them, stirring, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are a darkish brown and crisp. Remove them with a slotted spoon and spread on a paper towel.

Drop 7 or 8 pieces of meat at a time in the onion-flavored oil and brown them well over high heat on all sides. Remove each batch as it gets done. When all the meat has browned, turn off the heat under the pot.

When the remaining oil has cooled a bit, pour in the paste from the electric blender. Stir it well, mixing it with the juices in the pot. Turn up the heat and fry the paste, stirring all the time, 8 to 10 minutes or until it has browned. Now lower heat and add, at intervals, frying and stirring, the coriander, cumin, and turmeric; after a minute or two, the tomato sauce; and after another minute, the mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. Finally, after 5 minutes, add 1¼ cups water, salt, black pepper, cayenne, the browned meat, and the cleaned and washed _chana dal_. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring gently every 10 minutes or so. Do not let the grains of _dal_ break.

When done, add the lemon juice and stir gently.

To serve: Place in a warm bowl. Sprinkle the browned onions and chopped parsley over the _dal_ and meat and serve with plain rice or _chapatis_. Serve a green vegetable (green beans or peas) and at least one relish (a yogurt relish would be good).

## _Karhi_

SERVES 6–8

This dish looks like a very thick soup with dumplings. It is usually eaten with plain rice, and it was a great Sunday favorite with my family. It is made with chickpea flour and buttermilk (the more sour the buttermilk, the better), flavored with fennel, cumin, fenugreek, and mustard seeds.

FOR THE KARHI

_¾ cup chickpea flour_

_2 cups buttermilk_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 generous pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_¼ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_⅛ teaspoon whole fenugreek seeds_

_¼ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_2–3 whole dried hot peppers_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_1½–2 teaspoons salt_

_2–3 tablespoons lemon juice_

FOR THE PAKORIS, OR DUMPLINGS

_1 cup chickpea flour_

_½ teaspoon baking powder_

_½ teaspoon salt_

_½ teaspoon ground cumin_

_Vegetable oil for deep frying_

TO MAKE THE KARHI

Sift the ¼ cup chickpea flour into a bowl. Add ½ cup of the buttermilk, a little at a time, and mix well until you have a thick, smooth paste. Now add the remaining 1½ cups buttermilk, mixing as you pour it in. Add 5 cups of water to the bowl, mix again, and set aside.

*In a heavy-bottomed 4–5 quart pot, heat the oil over medium-high flame. When hot, put in the asafetida. In a few seconds, as soon as the asafetida expands, add the fennel, cumin, mustard, fenugreek, and onion seeds. When the seeds darken, put in the dry peppers. When they start to darken, add the turmeric, and a second later, the liquid from the bowl. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 1 hour.

Add salt and lemon juice. Cook another 10 minutes covered. Turn off heat.*

TO MAKE PAKORIS, OR DUMPLINGS

(These can be made while _karhi_ is cooking): Sift the cup of chickpea flour and the baking powder into a bowl. Add salt and cumin. Add water slowly, mixing as you go, until you have a very thick, doughy paste—thick enough to stand in peaks. You will need about ½ cup of water, perhaps a little less.

The ideal utensil for deep-frying _pakoris_ is a _karhai_ or Chinese wok. If you do not have one, use any other utensil you find convenient. Put at least 2½ inches of oil in and heat over a medium-low flame. Give it 10 minutes to heat. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl halfway with warm water and set it somewhere near you.

When the oil is heated, drop the doughy paste, a teaspoonful at a time, into the oil, using a second teaspoon to help release the paste. Make sure you do not drop one dumpling right on top of another. Put in enough to cover the surface and no more. The dumplings will sink first and then rise and float. Fry each batch slowly, for 6 to 7 minutes, turning them at least once; they must not brown. If they begin to darken, lower your flame. They should retain their yellowish color, but cook through. As soon as each batch is done, lift them out with a slotted spoon and drop into the warm water. Let them soak 2 minutes, then remove from the water and squeeze them _very_ gently, taking care not to break them. Set them aside, covered.

When the _karhis_ is done and the heat turned off, lift the cover and put all the dumplings in. Stir gently. Do not cook the _karhi_ and the dumplings together until 10 minutes before you are ready to eat. Otherwise the dumplings will disintegrate. Now you can bring the _karhi_ to a boil, covered. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes.

To serve: Take _karhi_ and _pakoris_ carefully out of the pot so as not to break the _pakoris_. Place in serving bowl. Serve with plain rice, _Khare Masale Ka Gosht_ , a vegetable, and a relish.

## _Tomato karhi_

SERVES 6–8

This is a variation of the North Indian _karhi_. It is served in Hyderabad and is cooked with tomatoes. It can be served with or without the _pakoris_ , or dumplings.

_¾ cup chickpea flour_

_4 cups tomato sauce_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_A generous pinch ground asafetida or tiny lump asafetida_

_¼ teaspoon whole fennel seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_¼ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_⅛ teaspoon whole fenugreek seeds_

_¼ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), if available_

_2–3 whole dried hot peppers_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric powder_

_1½–2 tablespoons salt_

_4 tablespoons lemon juice_

Sift the flour into a bowl. Slowly add ½ cup water, mixing as you go, until you have a thick, smooth paste. Add another 2½ cups water, slowly, stirring all the time. Pour in the tomato sauce. Mix well. Set aside.

Now follow the rest of the recipe for _karhi_ the section marked between the two asterisks.

If you wish to make _the pakoris_ , follow preceding recipe.

Instead of _pakoris_ , sliced vegetables (green peppers, onions, mushrooms, squash, or zucchini) can be lightly sautéed in oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and dropped into the tomato _karhi_ 10 minutes before the cooking time is over.

To serve: See serving suggestions for preceding recipe.

## _Whole unhulled urad and rajma dal_

SERVES 6

The whole unhulled _dals_ , particularly _urad_ and _rajma_ , take a very long time to cook. This recipe takes 5 hours. You can, however, take comfort from the fact that they are 5 effortless hours. Once you put the _dal_ on, apart from an occasional stir, not much else is required of you. In the Punjab, where the whole _urad_ and _rajma dal_ are specialties, they are left to cook in a slow earthen oven _(tandoor)_ for 24 hours. Both _dals_ can be cooked individually, using this same recipe, or they can be mixed, in whatever proportion you desire. I have mixed them half and half.

_½ cup whole unhulled moong dal, cleaned and washed_

_½ cup whole unhulled rajma dal, cleaned and washed_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ½-inch cube, peeled and sliced_

_2 cloves of garlic, peeled_

_5 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1¾ teaspoons salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil orusli ghee_

_1 medium-sized onion, cut in half lengthwise, then finely sliced_

_A piece of freshginger, about ½-inch cube, peeled and grated_

_A pinch of ground asafetida or a snall lump about ⅛ inch square_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_2 dried hot red peppers_

In a very heavy-bottomed pot, combine the two _dals_ , 5 cups water, the sliced ginger, and the peeled garlic cloves. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer gently 4½ hours, stirring every hour or so.

Put the yogurt in a small bowl. Beat well with a fork. When the _dal_ has cooked for 4½ hours, lift off cover and mash it well against the sides of the pot with the back of a kitchen spoon. Pour in the yogurt, stirring as you do so. Also add the cayenne, salt, and pepper. Stir, bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer another 30 minutes.

Heat the oil or _ghee_ in an 8–10-inch skillet. When hot, put in the sliced onion. Fry, stirring, over medium-high flame for about 4 minutes, then put in the grated ginger and fry it along with the onions for 1 more minute, or until onions are brown and crisp. Remove onions and ginger with slotted spoon and set aside.

In the same oil put the asafetida, cumin, and red peppers. If the oil is very hot, the cumin and peppers will darken immediately. Turn off heat and pour contents of skillet into the pot with the _dal_. Cover pot again and leave until you are ready to serve.

To serve: Mix the _dal_ and ladle it into warm serving bowl. Sprinkle browned onions and ginger over it. At Delhi's famous Moti Mahal restaurant, a common order with this _dal_ is _Tandoori_ Chicken, _naan_ , and Onions Pickled in Vinegar.

## _Baris (or vadees) with eggplant and potatoes_

SERVES 6

To make _baris, dals_ are ground, mixed with spices, made into a hard dough, and then broken off into lumps and dried in the sun. My grandmother made her own _baris:_ I can still see them drying on white sheets spread over rope charpoys. These were laid out in the sunniest section of our large brick courtyard and watched over by a one-eyed hawk always perched on the telephone pole. But most people nowadays just go down to a grocery store and buy them. Usually, two kinds are available. One is _very_ hot, spiced with red and black pepper, and the other is very mild. Some specialty stores in America and England carry both varieties.

Since _baris_ come in different sizes, the large ones need to be broken into pieces roughly an inch in diameter. Use any heavy object to break them. A hammer will do. Any smaller pieces splintering off need not be thrown away. Just add them to the pot.

_Baris_ should be browned before they are cooked. Here is my mother's recipe for them.

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_1 cup baris, broken into pieces no larger than 1 inch in diameter_

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ½ inch cube, peeled and grated_

_1 teaspoon ground coriander_

_1 teaspoon ground cumin_

_½ teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 tablespoons tomato paste_

_2 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and quartered_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_2 small, long eggplants (if unavailable substitute 3 cups of the larger eggplant, diced into 1-inch cubes)_

Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet or 10-inch heavy-bottomed pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in _baris_ and fry them, turning frequently, for about 2 minutes or until they turn a few shades darker. (Do _not_ let them get a very dark brown.) Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside.

To the same oil, add first the chopped onions, stirring and frying continuously, for about 4 minutes, until the onions have turned dark at the edges. Lower the heat to medium low and add the garlic and ginger; keep stirring; after 2 minutes, add the coriander, cumin, and turmeric; stir again; and after 2 more minutes, put in the tomato paste and stir; finally, after another 2 minutes, add the fried _baris_ , 3 cups of water, the potatoes, and the salt. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 30 minutes.

Wash the eggplants. Do not break off the stem and the green part. Quarter the eggplants, lengthwise, all the way from the stem down, and drop the quarters into the pot. Add another ½ cup of water. Stir, bring to a boil again, cover, lower heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.

To serve: Bring the _baris_ to the table in a warm serving bowl. Let each person serve himself in small individual _katoris_ or bowls. Eat with _chapatis, pooris_ , or _parathas_. You could serve a meat dish (Lamb _Korma_ would be good) and a yogurt relish with it.

 o Indian meal is complete without at least one kind of relish. At its simplest, this can be a small, fresh, fiery green chili, or it can be a hastily peeled and quartered onion. In lower-middle-class families, when the wife packs her husband's lunch in the early hours of the morning, she may not have any meat or vegetable to offer him with his _roti_ (bread). What she will tuck in, though, with great love, ensconced between two _rotis_ , will be a tiny portion of a sour spicy raw mango pickle! It may well be the climate that causes appetites to wilt and turn apathetic, especially during the blazing summer months. Relishes are, perhaps, just ways of prodding sluggish bodies into perking up and eating. At any rate, Indians seem to find them both desirable and necessary.

My grandmother used to make a lime pickle which, if I remember correctly, took years to mature. We carried it with us on the long, car rides to the summer resorts Simla and Mussoori. When tossing and turning at the never-ending and ever-climbing hairpin bends made our taste buds turn green, my grandmother, like a familiar magician with his equally familiar trick, would say "aha" and produce a small brown crock filled with her lime pickles. They were sour and pungent and black with age. One tiny bite would make the mouth pucker at first, but ultimately leave it completely refreshed.

I saw my grandmother make this pickle just once. It took five servants, the ten women of the house, and my grandmother two whole days to do all the grinding, cutting, and stuffing. Then, as the pickle matured, my grandmother would walk the length of the storeroom every day, shaking the large crocks stored in several neat rows. Every month the limes needed to be stirred by hand. Not every hand, antiseptically clean though it might be, was allowed inside the crocks. According to my grandmother, the chemistry of most hands would cause the pickle to rot. It needed a very "special" hand, and in our household she had decided that this hand belonged to Ishri, my grandfather's personal servant. So this small wizened gentleman, and he alone, was allowed to push his gnarled hand into each crock and give the pickles a "swish." My grandmother must have been doing something right because she was the only lady in the neighborhood who made this pickle successfully. All others who tried it and who, unfortunately, did not have the valuable services of Ishri, ended up with various varieties of fungi! And when my grandmother died and her valuables were being parceled out, her famous lime pickle was also carefully distributed among selected relatives. Those lucky enough to get ajar treated it with great reverence because, by now, it was supposed to have not just taste but medicinal and even magical qualities!

The recipes for most chutneys and pickles are usually handed down from mother to daughter, each family group specializing in its own particular varieties and styles. The result is that different families will serve you completely different sets of relishes. There are now a few companies that produce and bottle relishes, but at the moment they have not quite succeeded in tearing the Indian housewife away from her own home efforts. Some of these bottled relishes are available in American specialty stores. You will have to taste and check them out for yourself. If you like _very_ hot pickles, I will recommend one particular brand to you. The firm of Har Narain Gopi Nath has been in the pickling business for decades. (Even my grandmother bought their red chili pickle, though she bought no other.) They now sell their pickles in this country. I would recommend only their stuffed red chili pickle. It is, as I said, _very_ hot, so just eat a pinhead with each morsel!

I have, very arbitrarily, I confess, divided relishes into three categories—chutneys, pickles, and "others." "Others" does not seem very dignified or very exotic, but you will begin to see my problem once I get to "others." Meanwhile, let me start with chutneys.

There are so many different kinds of chutneys—sweet chutneys, sour chutneys, sweet-and-sour chutneys, salty chutneys, hot chutneys, cold chutneys—the list could go on and on. The ingredients used in these chutneys can include tomatoes, ginger, onions, garlic, tamarind, bananas, mangoes, raisins, coconut, fresh coriander, fresh mint, lime juice, yogurt, vinegar, sugar, etc. Chutneys can be preserves—that is, they can be bottled and kept indefinitely, like Sweet Tomato Chutney, or they can be made fresh daily, like Tamarind Chutney with Bananas or Fresh Mint Chutney with Fruit (see the following recipes). In our home we had a special woman who came in daily to grind the spices. When the spices were done, her second daily task was to grind the fresh green coriander chutney which we had at every meal.

Chutneys are generally served in small nonmetallic bowls if they are to accompany a meal. Sometimes, however, they are used as a sauce to go over hot or cold foods, such as in Fried Eggplants with Tomato Chutney. Food can also be cooked in a chutney or with a chutney, as in _Kheema_ Used as a Stuffing. Some chutneys are eaten not as a relish but as a vegetable. In our family we eat a chutney made with the pulp of boiled green mangoes this way.

Pickles in India are a world in themselves. A whole book could be written about them. Pickles preserve, and in a land of warm climate and little refrigeration, almost everything gets pickled in order to prolong its life—hard berries, onions, raw mangoes, green chilies, cauliflower, carrots, turnips, limes, lemons, squash, eggplant, mutton, shrimp, lobsters, quail, partridge, bamboos, and what-have-you. My very dear brother-in-law once spotted a mound of rose petals on their way out to the garbage can. Appalled by the waste, he immediately retrieved and pickled them. A week later the rose-petal pickle jar was opened for tasting. Well! Not wanting my brother-in-law's morale and pickling initiative to fade away, we all kept saying, "Not bad, not bad at all, very interesting taste." I decided then that pickled rose petals were one thing I intended to stay away from!

Pickling is generally done in oil, vinegar, water, or lemon juice. Oil pickles can last for years, whereas water pickles have a limited life of 2 to 3 weeks, during which there are waxing, peak, and waning periods. Oil pickles can be hot and sour or hot and sweet (jaggery—or Indian molasses—often providing the sweetness). While ceramic or glass jars are used for oil pickles, the traditional water pickles are made in _mutkas_ , round pots of half-baked clay. As the water pickle matures, it picks up an earthen flavor that is very refreshing. These pickles are sour (a bit like the gherkin and cucumber-barrel pickles) and hot if you want them to be. Before each meal, a large bowl of the pickles, both water and vegetable, is removed from the earthenware pot and put to cool—in a refrigerator if there is one. This bowl is then brought to the table at mealtime. Each place setting has a cup or nonmetallic bowl into which people serve themselves both the vegetable and the water.

Fresh ginger or green chilies can be pickled in lime juice. The juice is boiled first and then added to the ginger or the chilies.

Small boiling onions are often pickled in red vinegar. These are then lifted out of the vinegar and served with dishes like _Tandoori_ Chicken.

There are, of course, many other relishes as well. And here we come to my category "others." Chopped or sliced onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers are sprinkled with lime juice (or vinegar), salt, pepper, and cayenne, and served in varying forms all over North India. Numerous dishes made with yogurt are also very popular. I feel America has still to discover the versatility of plain yogurt. At the moment, yogurt seems to provide nothing more than a quick lunch for the girl on a diet. Indians use yogurt as East Europeans use sour cream. Apart from cooking with it and using it as a marinade, we use it for hundreds of relishes. _Raitas_ are one of them. Here cooked or raw vegetables are added to well-mixed yogurt, seasonings are sprinkled in, and the dish is cooled before being served.

Various "dumplings" can also be made and put into yogurt. Since they never comprise a main dish, "relish" is a very good word for them.

Most Westerners seem to think that the usual relishes served with Indian food are Major Grey's chutney and little bowls filled with nuts, grated coconut, and sliced bananas and apples. If you have developed a taste for these items, eat them, by all means. But do experiment with some of these much more interesting local relishes.

## _Sweet tomato chutney_

MAKES 2½ CUPS

I make this chutney with canned tomatoes. You could, if you like, use fresh tomatoes when they are in season and really tasty. To peel them, you will need to drop them in boiling vinegar. When the skin crinkles, lift them out and peel. Then proceed with the recipe. When cooked, this chutney is sweet and sour, thick and garlicky.

_1 whole head of garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 inches long, 1 inch thick, and 1 inch wide, peeled and coarsely chopped_

_1½ cups wine vinegar_

_1-pound 12-ounce can whole tomatoes (or 2 pounds fresh tomatoes prepared as suggested above)_

_1½ cups granulated sugar_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_⅛–½ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_2 tablespoons golden raisins_

_2 tablespoons blanched slivered almonds_

Put the chopped garlic, ginger, and ½ cup of the vinegar into the container of an electric blender and blend at high speed until smooth. In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed pot with nonmetallic finish, place the tomatoes and juice from the can, the rest of the vinegar, the sugar, salt, and cayenne pepper (or, if you prefer, add the cayenne at the end, a little at a time, stirring and tasting as you do so). Bring to a boil. Add purée from the blender. Lower heat and simmer gently, uncovered, for about 1½ to 2 hours or until chutney becomes thick. (A film should cling to a spoon dipped in it.) Stir occasionally at first, and more frequently later as it thickens. You may need to lower the heat as the liquid diminishes. You should end up with about 2½ cups of chutney, and it should be at least as thick as honey after it cools. If the canned tomatoes you use have a lot of liquid in them, a longer cooking time may be required, resulting in a little less chutney.

Add the almonds and raisins. Simmer, stirring, another 5 minutes. Turn heat off and allow to cool. Bottle. Keep refrigerated.

To serve: Since this is one of my favorite sweet chutneys, I always spoon out a small bowl of it for all my dinner parties. It goes with almost all foods and is _very_ popular. Store, bottled, in the refrigerator. It keeps for months.

## _Fresh green chutney with Chinese parsley and yogurt_

SERVES 6

This chutney needs to be made the day it is eaten. It can be served in a small bowl as a relish, or it can be served over meat, cooked fish, or vegetables. If pressed to classify it, I would call this a "sour" chutney.

_1 packed cup chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1 fresh hot green chili, sliced, or ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)_

_8 ounces (1 container) plain yogurt_

_½ teaspoon salt (add more if you need it; the sourness of yogurt can vary with its age)_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground pepper_

_½ teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_1 tablespoon lemon juice_

Put the parsley and chili in the container of an electric blender with 3 tablespoons of water and blend until you have a smooth paste (you may need to push the parsley down a couple of times).

In a nonmetallic bowl, combine the yogurt, salt, pepper, cumin, lemon juice, and paste from the blender. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

To serve: Bring the cooled bowl to the table. You could serve it with almost any Indian meal. People should take just a tablespoon at a time.

## _Fresh mint chutney with fruit_

SERVES 6

_⅛–½ well-packed cup washed fresh mint leaves_

_4 tablespoons lemon juice_

_2 fresh hot green chilies (use less or more as desired; as substitute, use ½ green pepper plus ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper)_

_1 medium-sized tart apple, peeled, cored, and diced just before blending_

_1 orange, peeled, seeded, and cubed_

_1 teaspoon salt_

Combine all ingredients in the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste.

This chutney goes with most Indian foods. It is especially good with broiled _Seekh Kabab, Tandoori_ Chicken, and Vegetable _Pakoris_.

## _Tamarind chutney with bananas_

SERVES 4-6

This is another sweet and sour chutney made with tamarind pulp. The addition of roasted cumin and slices of ripe bananas is, I think, very particular to Delhi dwellers. My mother's family often added raisins as well. I have not included them in my recipe, but if you wish to do so, soak a tablespoon of golden raisins in hot water for 2 hours. Then remove them from the water and add them to the tamarind pulp at the same time that you add the bananas.

Even though this chutney can be made a day in advance, it is best to add the banana slices just before serving. Banana slices that have spent a night in the refrigerator look very unhappy!

_A piece of tamarind, the size of a tangerine_

_1–1½ tablespoons sugar_

_1¼ teaspoons salt_

_1 teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 ripe but firm banana_

Since the tamarind generally comes in a large block, tear off a lump about the size of a tangerine. Soak it overnight in ⅛ cup hot water in a small nonmetallic bowl or cup. (The water should cover the tamarind, so don't use a very wide bowl.) If you forget to do it overnight, do it first thing in the morning. All will not be lost! Soak it for a minimum of 4 hours.

Once it has soaked, mash down and break the lump in the water, making a thick, uneven pulp. I use my hands for this, but you could use the back of a wooden spoon.

Place a strainer over a nonmetallic bowl, put the tamarind pulp in the strainer, and press down with the back of a spoon. Keep pressing until nothing but fibrous tissues and seeds are left in the strainer. Discard fibrous tissues and seeds. Make sure you scrape all the strained pulp on the outside of the strainer—it doesn't always drip down.

Mix the strained pulp with the sugar, salt, cumin seeds, and cayenne.

Slice a peeled banana into ¼–⅛ inch slices and mix with the tamarind pulp.

To serve: Put into small ceramic or glass serving bowl and place on the table along with other chutneys and pickles.

## _Tomato tamarind chutney_

MAKES 2 CUPS

This is, basically, a sour chutney used as a sauce for fish and stuffed vegetables. It can be made in advance, put in ajar, and refrigerated for 3 or 4 days.

_4 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil_

_A generous pinch ground asafetida or ⅛-inch lump asafetida_

_½ teaspoon whole cumin seeds_

_½ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

_1 medium-sized onion, peeled and finely chopped_

_4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced_

_1½ cups tomato sauce_

_½ cup tamarind pulp (see recipe forTamarind Chutney with Bananas)_

_1¼–_ 1 _½ teaspoons salt_

_½ teaspoon garam masala_

_⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 teaspoon granulated sugar (adda bit more if you want to)_

Heat the oil in a 2-quart pot over medium-high heat. When hot, put in the asafetida, and a few seconds later, add the cumin and mustard seeds. The cumin seeds will begin to darken in the hot oil within a few seconds. Put in the chopped onions and minced garlic, and fry, stirring, for about 2 minutes, or until the onions darken at the edges.

Now pour in the tomato sauce and tamarind pulp. Also add the salt, _garam masala_ , cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne, and sugar. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer gently for 15 minutes.

To serve: Use as a sauce with fried vegetables or with _Kheema_ Used as Stuffing (for peppers, tomatoes, and eggplant).

## _Fresh coconut chutney_

SERVES 6–8

_1 cup fairly well-packed, grated freshcoconut_

_½ cup fairly well-packed, chopped Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_1–2 fresh hot green chilies (use as desired)_

_A piece of fresh ginger, about ½-inch cube, peeled and chopped_

_1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped_

_6 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_½ teaspoon salt_

_1 teaspoon lemon juice_

_1 tablespoon vegetable oil_

_⅛ teaspoon urad dal (the hulled, split variety) grains_

_¼ teaspoon whole black mustard seeds_

Put the coconut, parsley, green chilies, ginger, and garlic, along with 5 tablespoons of water, into the container of an electric blender. Blend at high speed until you have a smooth paste, stopping occasionally to push down the ingredients.

Pour contents of blender into a bowl. Add yogurt, salt, and lemon juice. Mix well.

In a 4–6-inch skillet, heat the oil. When very hot, put in the _dal_ grains and mustard seeds. As soon as the _dal_ darkens and the mustard seeds pop, pour contents of skillet into bowl with chutney. Mix well. Cover and chill until ready for use.

To serve: This South Indian chutney goes well with Vegetable _Pakoris_. It is also very good as a relish with most meals.

## _Carrot "water" pickle_

ABOUT 5 QUARTS

This is one of Delhi's most popular winter pickles. Like chestnuts, it is often sold at street corners, in large glass jars. The "water" in the pickle turns a glorious beet color because the carrot used is a special "black" carrot which "bleeds" like a beet root. Enthusiasm for this pickle has now become so refined that the real gourmets do not eat the carrot at all. They just drink the juice.

Unable to find the bleeding "black" carrot, I have substituted the ordinary orange carrot. However, I have thrown in some beets to supply the necessary color. I eat both the carrot and the beet. The juice, of course, is the best part of all.

This pickle is good for 10 days to 2 weeks. It will get more sour as time passes. You may need to add more salt as that happens. One way to slow its deterioration is to refrigerate it.

_1⅓ tablespoons salt_

_4 tablespoons black mustard seeds_

_1½ pounds carrots_

_2 medium-sized beets_

_2 hot dried red peppers_

Bring 4½ quarts water and the salt to a boil in a large pot.

Meanwhile, crush, pound, or grind the mustard seeds coarsely, so that they split at least in half, using either a heavy mortar and pestle or an Indian grinding stone.

Peel the carrots, removing the green top portion, and quarter them lengthwise. Halve each piece lengthwise once again.

Peel the beets and cut each into 3 rounds.

Place the beets and carrots in a clean 5–6-quart wide-mouthed jar. Pour boiling salted water over them. Add the mustard seeds and the red peppers. Allow to cool. Stir and cover.

Put a small label with the date on it so you will not forget exactly when you started the pickle. Stir once a day for 7 days with a clean wooden spoon. Keep covered. It should be ready on the seventh day.

To serve: Place in a bowl a slice or two of carrot plus half a ladleful of juice for each person eating. Cool in the refrigerator. Serve in small, individual, nonmetallic bowls.

## _Turnip "water" pickle_

ABOUT 5 QUARTS

Water pickles are a specialty of my family. I love them and find them very similar to the gherkins and cucumbers pickled in barrels and found in good delicatessens all over New York City.

This pickle takes a week to mature and then can be eaten for the next 2 weeks. It gets very sour as time passes, and you may need to add more salt to it. One way to slow its deterioration is to refrigerate it once it has matured. Both the vegetable and the juice are consumed.

_5 tablespoons black mustard seeds_

_3 pounds medium-sized white turnips_

_1⅓ tablespoons salt_

_2 whole dried hot red chilies (optional)_

Crush, pound, or grind the mustard seeds coarsely, so that they split at least in half, using either a heavy mortar and pestle or an Indian grinding stone.

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add salt to the water.

Peel the turnips and place in a clean 5–6-quart wide-mouthed jar. Pour boiling salted water over them. Add crushed mustard seeds and red chilies. Allow to cool.

Stir and put lid on. Stick a label with the date on the jar. Stir it every day with a clean wooden spoon. On the seventh day it will be ready to eat.

To serve: Place in a bowl a piece of pickle and half a ladleful of juice for each person eating. Cool in refrigerator and serve in small individual nonmetallic bowls.

## _Carrots pickled in oil_

ABOUT 1 QUART

This is perhaps the simplest oil pickle you could make. It takes about a week to mature. It can then be refrigerated and kept for months.

_2 teaspoons black mustard seeds_

_1 pound carrots of medium thickness_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_1 teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_1 teaspoon ground turmeric_

_2 cups vegetable oil_

Crush, pound, or grind mustard seeds coarsely, so that they split at least in half, using either a heavy mortar and pestle or an Indian grinding stone.

Peel the carrots. Cut off the coarse top and the bottom. Cut each carrot in 3 pieces. Halve or quarter these pieces lengthwise according to the thickness of the carrots.

Place carrots in clean, dry quart jar. Add salt, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and crushed mustard seeds.

Warm the oil and pour over the carrots. Put lid on tightly and shake the jar well. Leave in a warm place for 7 days. Shake the jar once or twice daily.

To serve: Shake the jar. Remove one or two carrot pieces for serving, and arrange in a small bowl or on relish tray. Do not serve the oil.

## _Onions pickled in vinegar_

ABOUT 1 QUART

This relish is served in Delhi's famous Moti Mahal restaurant. It is extremely simple to make. The onions need to marinate in the vinegar for at least 24 hours, so allow yourself sufficient time. In this recipe, I have made enough pickle to fill a quart jar. It should keep a month.

_1 pound white boiling onions (pick small, clean, even-sized onions)_

_2 cups red wine vinegar_

_2 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced_

_2 whole dried red peppers_

_1 tablespoon salt_

Peel onions. Slicing only three-quarters of the way down, quarter them lengthwise. Each onion should stay whole, with the four sections attached at the bottom. Place the onions in a clean, wide-mouthed quart jar. You may have a few left over.

In a nonmetallic bowl, combine the vinegar, garlic, red peppers, and salt. Mix well. Pour this mixture over the onions to cover them. Put on a tight lid and set the jar aside for 24 hours.

The pickle is now ready. Refrigerate the jar. The onions can be taken out and eaten as and when desired.

To serve: Take as many of the onions out of the vinegar as you need and place them in a glass or other nonmetallic bowl. They go well with _Tandoori_ Chicken and Whole Unhulled _Urad_ and _Rajma Dal_.

## _Cucumber raita_

SERVES 4–6

This is a refreshing, cool yogurt and cucumber relish. In the hot summer months, it really takes the place of a salad.

_1 cucumber_

_16 ounces (2 containers) plain yogurt_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_½ teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_⅛ teaspoon paprika (for garnishing)_

Peel and grate the cucumber.

Empty the yogurt into serving bowl and beat it well with a fork until it is smooth and pastelike.

Add the cucumber, salt, black pepper, roasted cumin (reserve a pinch for garnish), and cayenne to the bowl with the yogurt.

Sprinkle with paprika and the pinch of roasted cumin. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To serve: Bring bowl of cold yogurt to the table. This relish goes well with nearly all Indian meals.

## _Yogurt with tiny dumplings (boondi-ka-dahi)_

SERVES 6–8

The only yogurt relish served at all our family wedding banquets was this one. Tiny little droplets of a chickpea flour paste are dropped into deep fat and fried. They are then softened in warm water. Finally they are combined with yogurt and spices, freshly roasted cumin being perhaps the most important ingredient used. You can make this relish as hot as you like. When I make it in America, I put in just a touch of cayenne pepper. But at those wedding banquets in India, it was a cool scorcher!

In India the dumplings are made by pushing the batter through the holes of a slotted spoon into the hot oil. The Indian slotted spoons have round holes about ⅛ inch wide. If you can find a spoon like that, use it. If you have a colander with holes this size, it could work as well.

FOR THE DUMPLINGS

_4 heaping tablespoons chickpea flour_

_¼ teaspoon baking powder_

_¼ teaspoon salt_

_¼ teaspoon ground cumin seeds_

_Vegetable oil for deep frying, enough to have 1 inch in the skillet_

FOR THE YOGURT

_24 ounces (3 containers) plain yogurt_

_1½ teaspoons salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_1 teaspoon freshly roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_⅛ teaspoon paprika_

Place the chickpea flour and the baking powder in a bowl. Add a little water at a time (about ⅓ cup altogether) and mix to a thick, smooth paste, stiff enough to stand in tiny peaks. Use a wooden spoon or your fingers to do this. Add ¼ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon cumin and mix well. Set aside.

In an 8–10-inch skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Get your slotted spoon or colander, whichever you are going to use. When the oil is hot, place a tablespoon of batter on the slotted spoon or the colander and push it through with the back of a clean wooden spoon. Little droplets will fall into the oil. They should cook slowly—turning crisp, but staying a golden yellow; they should not turn brown. This will take about 5 minutes. Adjust flame if necessary. As each batch gets done, remove it with a slotted spoon and dump it in a bowl filled with warm water. Continue until all the paste is used up. Let dumplings soak in water for 30 minutes.

Now get the yogurt ready. In a bowl, mix the yogurt well. Then add the salt, black pepper, roasted cumin, and cayenne, reserving a pinch of the cumin for garnishing later. Cover and refrigerate the yogurt until almost ready to serve.

Just before serving, take out the dumplings, a handful at a time. Lay your other palm over them and gently squeeze out excess water. Do not break them. Put them in serving bowl. Pour yogurt over them and mix well.

Garnish by sprinkling paprika and the pinch of roasted ground cumin over the top.

To serve: This yogurt dish goes very well with nearly all the lamb and pork dishes in this book. Do not serve it with other dishes containing dumplings, e.g., _Karhi_.

## _Yogurt with potatoes_

SERVES 4–6

This is perhaps the Indian version of potato salad. It is a little moister, and if I may allow myself to be prejudiced, a little tastier.

_2 medium-sized boiling potatoes_

_16 ounces (2 containers) plain yogurt_

_1–1½ teaspoons salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_1 teaspoon freshly roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

GARNISH

_⅛ teaspoon paprika_

Boil the potatoes and allow them to cool thoroughly.

Put the yogurt in a bowl and mix well with a fork. Add the salt, black pepper, roasted cumin, and cayenne. Mix well.

Peel the potatoes and dice them into ½-inch cubes. Mix with the yogurt.

To serve: Pour yogurt and potatoes into serving bowl. Sprinkle with paprika and serve. This dish may be made several hours in advance, covered tightly and refrigerated.

## _Yogurt with roasted eggplant (baigan-ka-bharta)_

SERVES 4–6

When I was a child and all food was cooked over coals, an eggplant was often put to bake in the ashes that fell below the grates in our stove. The eggplant would cook and soften and acquire a sumptuous smoked flavor. It was then peeled, mashed, and added to yogurt, along with minced onions and fresh mint. Here is that recipe. Instead of ashes, I use the direct flame of a gas burner!

_1 medium-sized eggplant_

_16 ounces (2 containers) plain yogurt_

_1 small onion, peeled and finely minced_

_2 tablespoons finely minced fresh mint_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 teaspoon freshly roasted, groundcumin seeds_

Wash and wipe the eggplant. Line a burner with an aluminum protector if possible. Stand the eggplant directly on the gas burner and turn the flame on medium or medium low. Roast the eggplant on all sides, turning it over carefully. (For more detailed instructions, see Eggplant _Bharta_.) It should look fairly charred on the outside, and the inside should get soft and pulpy. This may take 20 to 25 minutes.

Peel the eggplant under cold running water, making sure all the blackened skin and the stem are removed. Now mince the pulp very finely and place in a bowl.

Empty yogurt into a serving bowl and mix well with fork. Add onion, mint, eggplant, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and roasted cumin. Mix. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To serve: Serve cold as an hors d'oeuvre or as salad-type relish.

## _Yogurt with spinach_

SERVES 4–6

_10–16 ounces fresh spinach_

_2 teaspoons salt_

_16 ounces (2 containers) plain yogurt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

_1 teaspoon freshly roasted, groundcumin seeds_

Wash and trim the spinach. Make sure no sand is left.

Bring 4 quarts of water to boil in large pot. Add 1 teaspoon salt. When boiling, drop spinach in it and cover. As soon as the spinach wilts, remove it and put it in a colander. Run cold water over it until it cools. Drain. Squeeze out the water by pressing spinach between your palms and then mince.

Place the yogurt in a bowl and mix well with a fork. Add the minced spinach, 1 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne, and cumin. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

To serve: Serve cold with Lamb Cooked in Dark Almond Sauce or _Koftas_. Serve also with cauliflower or carrots or potatoes.

## _Cucumber and tomato with lemon juice_

SERVES 4

_1 medium-sized cucumber_

_1 medium-sized tomato_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_1 teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_1–1½ tablespoons lemon juice_

_2 tablespoons minced Chinese parsley (coriander greens or cilantro)_

_⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)_

Peel cucumber and dice it finely (about ¼-inch cubes). Dice tomato as finely as cucumber. Combine all ingredients in serving bowl. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

To serve: Bring cold serving bowl to table. This relish can be eaten with nearly all Indian meals.

## _Tomato and onion with lemon juice_

SERVES 4

_1 medium-sized tomato_

_1 medium-sized onion_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_1 teaspoon roasted, groundcumin seeds_

_1–1½ tablespoons lemon juice_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

Dice tomato in ¼-inch cubes. Peel and chop the onion. Combine all ingredients in serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

To serve: Bring cold serving bowl to table. This relish can be eaten with nearly all Indian meals.

## _Chopped onions in vinegar_

SERVES 4–6

_2 medium-sized onions, peeled and chopped_

_1 teaspoon salt_

_⅛–¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper_

_¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper_

_4 tablespoons red wine vinegar_

Combine all ingredients in small serving bowl. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

To serve: Bring cold serving bowl to table. This relish can be eaten with nearly all Indian meals.

## _Raw onion rings_

These are very good served with barbecued meats, chicken, and fish.

Peel onions and slice them into paper-thin rounds. Place in bowl containing cold water. Add a few cubes of ice, cover, and refrigerate. Leave an hour or two.

Drain, and scatter over meat, chicken, or fish.

_Chapati_

_Poori_

_Paratha_

_Bhatura_

_Naan_

 n India, we call our Indian bread _roti_ and we call the Western-type loaf a _dubbul_ (double) _roti_ , probably because of the expansion caused by the yeast. Most of our everyday breads are unleavened—somewhat like the Mexican tortilla, but much more varied in shape, taste, and texture. They are generally made out of whole-wheat flour, though barley, maize, millet, chickpea, and plain white flour are also used. We do make leavened breads like the _naan_ , but they tend to be flat, rising only ½ to ¾ inch in height.

Throughout most of North India _ata_ , or finely ground whole-wheat flour, is measured out onto a very large brass platter, or _paraat_ , for kneading. This _paraat_ is essential because Indian kitchens do not have Formica countertops and because Indians prefer to do most of their kitchen work—chopping, cutting, grinding, and kneading—in a squatting position. Once the dough has been kneaded (this is done with clenched fists—the knuckles pressing into the dough), it is formed into a lump, covered with a damp cloth, and left on one side of the _paraat_. Just before cooking, it is kneaded again and made into little patties. These are then rolled out on a round board into _chapatis, parathas_ , or _pooris_. Even though I do have a _paraat_ in my New York kitchen, I find it just as easy to use my kitchen counter for both the kneading and the rolling. If you happen to have a marble slab, you could use that instead.

Breads are cooked on the _tava_ , a heavy, cast-iron, slightly curved griddle, or in a _karhai_ , a woklike utensil for deep frying, or they are baked in the clay oven known as the _tandoor_. For a _tava_ you can substitute an 8–10-inch cast-iron griddle or skillet; for a _karhai_ you can use any wide, heavy casserole-type pot (cast-iron would be excellent); and for the _tandoor_ , one just has to use the oven or a charcoal grill.

While Indian rice can be eaten with a fork, Indian bread _must_ be eaten with the hands—or rather, with one hand. A small piece of the bread is broken off, wrapped around a morsel of food, and eaten. Only one hand is used—and just the fingertips at that. The other hand has to be kept clean to pass food or pick up a glass of water.

A word of encouragement about these breads. If they do not turn out perfectly the first time, do not lose heart. There are many Indians who have not mastered them either! So much depends on how well they are rolled out, and perfection in this area comes only with long practice. If you are persistent, you will surely master them.

Here are some of the basic breads.

## _Chapati_

SERVES 4

This simple bread requires only whole-wheat flour and water. It needs to be rolled out very evenly on a floured surface. Indians keep a quantity of plain whole-wheat flour on the side and keep dusting the _chapati_ with it as they roll. Next, the _chapati_ needs to be cooked on a _hot_ griddle. Give the griddle time to heat before you put the first _chapati_ on. When both sides of the _chapati_ are roasted, it is taken off the griddle and placed on an open fire. This makes it puff up with hot air. A _chimta_ or some flat unserrated tongs are essential for the making of the bread. Note: Some whole-wheat flour is very coarse. Many Indians prefer to mix it half and half with all-purpose white flour.

_1 cup whole-wheat (not coarse, stone-ground) flour for dough_

_About ½ cup finely ground whole-wheat flour to keep on the side for dusting_

Place the flour in a bowl. Slowly add up to ½ cup water and mix until all the flour adheres and you can knead it. (You will probably need a little less than the ½ cup water.) Now knead it for 7 to 8 minutes. Roll into a ball. Cover with a damp cloth and leave for ½ to 3 hours. (If you wish to leave it longer, cover it with a plastic wrap and refrigerate. It will easily stay 24 hours.)

Dampen hands and knead the dough again. Put the _tava_ or cast-iron griddle or skillet on a _medium_ flame to heat. Knead dough while the griddle is heating. Divide the dough into 8 balls. Keep balls covered with damp cloth. Flour the rolling surface and keep some dry flour on the side for dusting. Take out one ball. Flatten it. Dip it in the dry flour. Now roll it out evenly into a _chapati_ about 5 inches in diameter. You can get it even bigger and thinner if you like. It will stick to the surface as you roll it unless you keep dipping it in the dry flour. Always keep your surface well floured.

The _tava_ or griddle should be smoking hot by now. Place the uncooked _chapati_ on it. Within half a minute or so bubbles will start rising. Now turn the _chapati_ over with the _chimta_ or tongs. Let the other side cook for half a minute. Both sides should have light brown spots on them. Lift off _chapati_ with the tongs and lay it directly over the medium flame of another burner. (You could use the same burner, but you would have to lift off the _tava_ or griddle every time. As a matter of fact, this is what most Indians do!) Keep it there a few seconds. It will puff up immediately. Now turn it over and keep the other side over the flame for a few seconds.

Either serve hot immediately, or butter on one side very lightly and place _chapati_ on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Fold over the aluminum foil and shut edges firmly. Do all _chapatis_ this way. They will stay warm for 20 to 30 minutes if well covered in the foil and kept in a warm place.

To serve: _Chapatis_ are eaten with nearly all Indian main dishes.

## _Poori_

SERVES 4–6

The dough here is rather like that of the _chapati_ , only a little oil is added. Some people like to add a bit of salt as well to the dough. It is then kneaded and rolled out. Deep fat is heated in a wok, _karhai_ or deep skillet, and the _pooris_ are fried quickly in it. They puff up like the _chapati_. It is important that the fat be smoking hot. _Pooris_ can be made ahead of time and wrapped lightly in aluminum foil. They do not stay puffed this way, but they still taste good. They can be reheated (in the foil) in a 300° oven for 10 minutes. Instead of using only whole-wheat flour for the dough you can use a combination of whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour. I tend to use the latter, and it seems to make the _pooris_ more pliable.

_½ cup whole-wheat (not coarse, stone-ground) flour_

_½ cup all-purpose white flour_

_1½ tablespoons vegetable oil_

_Oil for deep frying, enough to have 2–3 inches in skillet_

_About ½ cup finely ground whole-wheat flour to keep on the side for dusting_

Place whole-wheat and white flour in a bowl. Pour the oil over it. Slowly add up to ½ cup water and mix until all the flour adheres and you can knead it. (You will probably need a little less than ½ cup water.) Knead it well for 7 to 8 minutes. Form into a ball, cover with a damp cloth, and leave for 1½ to 3 hours. (If you wish to leave it longer, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate. It will keep up to 24 hours.)

Heat the oil in the _karhai_ , wok, or skillet over a medium flame. Give it time to get smoking hot. I wait 10 minutes before I put the first _poori_ in.

While the oil is heating, knead the dough again. Divide the dough into 14 balls, keeping those you are not rolling covered with damp cloth. Flatten the balls one at a time and roll them out this way: first dip the flattened ball in the whole-wheat flour that you have on the side. Now roll it evenly, sprinkling the surface and the _poori_ with flour when you need to, until it is about 3½ to 4 inches in diameter. Do not allow it to stick to the surface. Whenever it does, dip it in the dry flour.

Test the hot oil by dropping a _poori_ in it. It will first sink to the bottom. Then, within a few seconds, it will rise and sizzle. Now you can do one of two things. Either keep pushing the _poori_ down gently—with swift but soft pushes, using the back of a slotted spoon—or, with swift strokes, baste the _poori_ with the hot oil. In basting, what you actually do is push the hot oil toward and over the _poori_. Or you can do both of these things. But do it fast. Within half a minute, the _poori_ should puff up. Turn it over with a slotted spoon, and cook another 30 seconds. Remove with slotted spoon, drain on paper towel, and serve immediately. If the first poori comes out hard, you are cooking it too long, or the oil is not hot enough, or both.

If you do not wish to serve the puffed-up _pooris_ right away, deflate them as they come out of the _karhai_ (watch out for that steam!) by pressing down on them; wrap tightly in a large sheet of aluminum foil. (Do not crush them, though.) As the _pooris_ get done, lay them one over the other, and keep wrapping the lot with foil. This will keep them soft. If they are served this way, at room temperature, they are known as _baasi_ , or "stale," _pooris_. If you wish to reheat them, place the foil bundle in a 300° preheated oven for 10 minutes.

To serve: _Pooris_ go well with _Kheema_ , with Lamb Cooked in Dark Almond Sauce, with Chicken _Moghlai_ , and nearly all the vegetable dishes.

## _Paratha_

SERVES 4–8

A _paratha_ is cooked on the griddle but with butter or _ghee_ rather like a pancake. In Delhi and Uttar Pradesh it is often triangular in shape, flaky, and very delicate. It can be made with whole-wheat flour or with an equal combination of whole-wheat and all-purpose white flour.

_1½ cups whole-wheat (not coarse, stone-ground) flour_

_1 tablespoon vegetable oil_

_½ teaspoon salt_

_About 4 tablespoons melted butter orusli ghee_

_½ cup whole-wheat flour to keep on the side for dusting_

Place the 1½ cups of flour in a bowl. Pour the oil over it. Add the salt. Slowly add about ½ cup water (you may need a bit more), and mix until all the flour adheres and you can knead. Knead the dough well for 8 to 10 minutes. Form into a ball. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes. (If you wish to leave it longer, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. It will keep up to 24 hours.)

Put a _tava_ or griddle or cast-iron skillet to heat over a medium flame. Knead dough once again for a minute. Divide dough into 8 balls. Keep balls covered with damp cloth. Take one ball out at a time and flatten it slightly. Dip it in the extra flour and roll it out evenly on a floured surface until it is about 5 inches in diameter. (You may need to sprinkle more flour on it and on the surface as you go along.) Now brush the surface of the _paratha_ lightly with butter. Fold in half. Brush the surface with butter again. Fold in half a second time. You now have a triangular shape.

Roll out this triangle, with the aid of the dry flour, so that its sides are about 5 inches long (it does not have to be too even).

Brush the _tava_ or griddle with melted butter. Place the triangular _paratha_ on it. As soon as one side is a golden brown, turn it over. Add a little more butter to the _tava_ or griddle and cook the second side until it is also a golden brown. A few dark spots are perfectly all right. It should not get too dark or too crisp. Adjust flame to avoid this.

As each _paratha_ is done, place on a large sheet of aluminum foil and cover tightly. Put all _parathas_ in the aluminum this way. When ready to eat, preheat oven to 300° and heat covered _parathas_ for 10 minutes.

To serve: _Parathas_ go very well with nearly all vegetable dishes, particularly peas, potatoes, and cauliflower.

## _Bhatura_

SERVES 4

The _bhatura_ is a bit like a deep-fried version of the _naan_. It is very popular in the Punjab as a "snack" bread, eaten with spiced chickpeas.

_1 cup all-purpose white flour, plus a little extra flour for dusting_

_¼ teaspoon baking powder_

_1 egg, beaten_

_1–1½ tablespoons plain yogurt_

_A little vegetable oil for brushing on dough_

_Vegetable oil for deep frying, enough to have 2½ inches in pot_

Sift the cup of flour and the baking powder into a bowl. Add the egg and begin to mix. Slowly add the yogurt and gather together the flour. Begin kneading. Add as much yogurt as will give you a soft dough. Knead dough for 10 minutes until it is smooth. Form into a ball, brush with oil, cover with damp cloth, and keep in a warm place for 3 hours.

With moistened hands, knead dough again.

Put oil in _karhai_ wok, or other wide utensil for deep frying. Heat over medium flame. Allow oil time to get smoking hot.

Divide dough into 8 balls and cover with damp cloth. Take one ball at a time and flatten it. Flour the rolling surface. Roll out the ball into a 4½-inch round, and drop it in when the oil is smoking. As it begins to sizzle, press down on it gently with the back of a slotted spoon. It will puff up. Turn it over and let other side brown lightly. The whole process should take about a minute. Do all _bhaturas_ this way.

To serve: Serve hot with _Chana Masaledar_ or any meat or vegetable dish.

## _Naan_

SERVES 6

_Naan_ is a leavened flat bread shaped like a teardrop. It is best when cooked in the clay oven called the _tandoor_. While meats, chicken, and fish broil on large skewers inside the _tandoor_ , moistened _naans_ are stuck to its walls to bake.

_3 cups all-purpose white flour_

_½ cup plus 3 tablespoons milk_

_1 egg, beaten_

_¾ teaspoon salt_

_2 teaspoons sugar_

_1 teaspoon baking powder_

_½ packet dry yeast_

_2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus a little more for brushing on dough later_

_4 tablespoons plain yogurt_

_¼ teaspoon black onion seeds (kalonji), or poppy seeds as substitute_

Sift the flour into a bowl. Place the milk in a small pot and warm slightly. Remove from heat. In another bowl combine the egg, salt, sugar, baking powder, yeast, 2 tablespoons oil, yogurt, and 5 tablespoons of the warm milk.

Mix well. Pour mixture over flour and rub it in with the hands.

Add 1 tablespoon of warm milk at a time to the flour, and begin kneading. Add up to 6 tablespoons or enough so that all the flour adheres and kneading is easy. Knead well for about 10 minutes or until dough is elastic. Form into a ball, brush with oil, cover with damp cloth, and leave in a warm place to rise. If the temperature is above 80° it should take only 2 hours. Otherwise it may take about 3 hours.

Preheat broiler to about 550°.

Line 3 cookie sheets with aluminum foil. Brush them lightly with oil.

Knead the dough again for a minute or two and divide into 6 balls. Flatten the balls one at a time, keeping the rest covered, and stretch them and pat them with your hands until you have a teardrop shape about 11 inches long and 4 inches wide. Do all balls this way, placing _2 naans_ on each baking sheet as you do so. Cover with moistened cloths and leave for 15 minutes in a warm place.

Remove moistened cloths. Brush the center portion of each _naan_ with water, leaving a ½-inch margin. Sprinkle the center portion with the onion or poppy seeds.

Place sheets under the broiler, about 2½–3 inches away from the heat and broil quickly for about 2½ minutes on each side or until lightly browned.

To serve: Serve _naans_ hot with _Tandoori_ Chicken, _Seekh Kabab_ , Lamb Cooked in Dark Almond Sauce, or Chicken _Moghlai_.

_Kulfi_

_Gajar-ka-halva_

_Broiled bananas_

_Fried dates_

_Shahi tukra_

_Malpua_

_Kheer_

_Gulab jamun_

 n Europe and America, most meals end with dessert and coffee. In India most meals end with fruit—leechees, loquats, melons, watermelons, _cheekoos_ , and mangoes in the summer, and apples, oranges, bananas, guavas, and pomegranates in the winter. These are often peeled at the table by the eldest woman of the house, and then passed around, always starting with the children. Desserts or "sweets" are served mainly at very special luncheons and dinners, at snack time and tea time, and at religious festivals (which come extremely frequently!).

"Snack time" seems to have an unusually elevated place in Indian life. I remember when I was working in television shows in Delhi. We would be deep in rehearsal when, almost every hour, there would come a desperate cry from some corner of the studio: " _Quon bhai, chai hojai?"_ ("Well now, brother, how about tea?"). Every actor and technician would stop (happily) in his tracks, and the whole group would saunter off to the nearest snack shop to have sweet and savory snacks—and tea. The very spicy hot _samosas_ and the sugary-sweet _gulab jamuns_ were eaten simultaneously—a bite of one balancing a bite of the other and each swallowed with a soothing sip of scalding tea.

Tea has not always been drunk in India. Until the end of the last century it was more or less unknown in the subcontinent. With their sweet and sour snacks, Indians generally drank _shurbut_ —fruit juice concentrates diluted with cold water—or hot, frothy milk. This milk was, and still is, sold by the snack vendor whose status often hinges upon how much froth he can raise. Since he has no frothing machine at his disposal, he achieves his bubbly result by briskly pouring the hot milk back and forth from one tumbler to another. These tumblers are first held close to each other. Slowly they are moved to a distance of several feet. The fast-flying milk never misses its mark and the stream of milk looks like taffy being pulled between the tumblers. This sight is responsible for one of Delhi's oldest jokes, about the visitor from the old Northwest Frontier who asked if he might have "two yards of that white thing" along with his other sweets!

Tea, which is easily North India's favorite snack beverage, has now replaced both _shurbut_ and milk. It was introduced to India by the British in the early 1900's. By this time the English had already been drinking Chinese teas for over two centuries. They decided to try planting Chinese tea seeds in the hilly regions of Assam. There they discovered, much to their surprise, fully grown tea trees that turned out to be not solitary accidents of nature, but parts of whole forests of tea trees. So the English went in with their Chinese seeds, their Chinese labor, and their pruning shears to tame this "wild" area. Soon they realized that neither the Chinese seeds nor the Chinese labor was necessary and that the native Indian tea was not only good but also proving very popular with the customers in England.

The next market they looked to was India itself. This turned out to be no problem at all. The Indians took to tea like fish to water. They learned to drink it like the English—strong, with a little milk and sugar. The milk was added to the strong tea to "fix" the tannin content and rid it of most of its astringency.

The Indian teas come from various regions of both North and South India and are generally of the dark fermented varieties. My own favorite is the Orange Pekoe from Darjeeling, with its smoky, nutty flavor. Indians almost never use tea-bags. They generally brew their loose tea leaves in a warm teapot. Here is how you can make a good pot of tea: 1. Use freshly boiled water. Do not let it overboil, since water that is kept boiling tends to become de-aerated. 2. Heat the teapot by rinsing it with boiling water. 3. Put into the teapot one teaspoon of tea leaves per cup of water to be used plus one teaspoon more for the pot. (If you like your tea weak add more hot water once the tea has brewed.) 4. Pour the boiling water over the tea leaves, cover and set aside for three minutes. If you are lucky enough to have a teacozy, cover your teapot with it. 5. Lift cover, stir, and strain into teacups. 6. Serve plain or with lemon and sugar or with hot milk and sugar or, if you like, with just sugar or just milk.

Many of the packaged teas available in America are blends of teas from several regions—often from several countries. Teabags also contain blends—some being slightly better than others. Pure Darjeeling teas, labeled as such, are available in some supermarkets and most specialty food shops. If you buy a pound of loose tea, store it in a tightly covered, light-proof container, away from the scent of strong spices and herbs.

Indian sweets tend to be _very_ sweet. They tend also to be made of ingredients like vegetables (carrots, pumpkin), nuts (pistachios, almonds, coconut), flours (plain flour, rice flour, chickpea flour), and sweeteners (sugar, jaggery). But the most important ingredient is milk. Milk forms the base of more than half our sweets, and it is often milk in a form entirely unused in the West. Milk is boiled for hours until it forms a semisolid dough called _khoya_. Most people do not make _khoya_ at home. They go out and buy it. It is simpler. Since _khoya_ is unavailable here, I have used several substitutes, powdered milk being one of them. For other desserts, milk is boiled down until it is half or a third of its original quantity. Since I do this in a few of the recipes, let me give you a few tips that may help you.

### _How to boil milk down_

1. Use a very heavy-bottomed pot. Cast-iron or aluminum covered with porcelain is particularly good for this.

2. Since the process is slow and tedious (it may take 1 to 1½ hours), bring a chair and a book to your stove.

3. Bring the milk to an "almost" boil. Watch it. If you let it boil over, you will have a big mess to clean. As soon as it seems that the milk will start to boil and rise, turn heat down to a medium low.

4. Adjust heat so that milk is always bubbling, but will not bubble over.

5. Once the milk has begun its slow boil, settle down with your book. Stir the milk every few minutes.

6. If a creamy crust forms on top, just stir it into the milk. It will taste fine when cold.

## _Kulfi_

SERVES 6

This is Indian ice cream at its best. Milk is boiled down to a third of its original quantity. Sugar, cardamom, and nuts are added, and the thickened milk is then poured into special conical containers and frozen. Traditionally, _kulfi_ is served with _falooda_ , a transparent vermicelli rather like the Japanese noodles in a sukiyaki. Since I do not expect you to have the conical containers, you could use empty cans of frozen fruit juice, or individual custard cups or paper cups or even a single bowl.

_6 cups milk_

_4 whole cardamom pods_

_2 tablespoons sugar_

_1 tablespoon slivered unsalted pistachios_

In a very heavy-bottomed pot, boil milk down to 2 cups (see note). This may take up to 1½ hours. After the first hour, lightly crush 2 of the cardamom pods and add them to the milk.

When the milk has boiled down to 2 cups, turn off heat. Remove and discard cardamom pods. Add sugar and nuts. Stir well.

Grind the seeds from the other 2 cardamom pods and add them to the milk. Leave milk to cool.

When cool, stir once and pour milk equally into six 3-ounce or 4-ounce paper cups, or similar containers, or a bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and freeze. Stir the _kulfi_ every 20 to 30 minutes to help break up the crystals. It will get harder to stir as it thickens. When it becomes too thick to stir, leave to freeze solid. Keep covered.

To serve: Run a warm knife along the inside of each cup or container to remove the _kulfi_. (You may need to pour warm water on the outside to loosen it.) Serve individual portions on small chilled plates.

## _Gajar-ka-halva_

SERVES 8

In this carrot halva, the carrots are completely unrecognizable. Milk and grated carrots are cooked until they become a dryish homogeneous mass. Sugar (and, if you like, lightly fried raisins and nuts) are then added, and the dish is served warm or at room temperature.

_4 cups milk_

_2 pounds carrots, peeled and grated_

_2 cardamom pods_

_10 tablespoons vegetable oil orusli ghee_

_3 tablespoons sugar_

_1 tablespoon each lightly fried raisins and almonds (optional)_

_1 cup heavy cream (optional)_

Put the milk, grated carrots, and cardamom pods in a 10-inch heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until no liquid is left. This may take about 30 minutes.

Add the oil, turn the heat down slightly, and start frying the carrot-milk mixture, stirring _all the time_. Continue until the carrots turn a reddish brown. This may take 30 to 40 minutes.

Add sugar and, if you like, raisins and almonds. Cook, stirring, another 2 minutes. Turn off heat. Allow halva to cool. Cover and refrigerate until ready to eat.

To serve: This halva can be warmed or served at room temperature. In India, it is often served with clotted cream—the cream that forms when unhomogenized milk is boiled. You could, if you like, serve it with heavy cream just lightly whipped so it doubles in bulk.

## _Broiled bananas_

SERVES 4

_1 tablespoon melted butter_

_2 very firm large bananas_

_1 teaspoon lemon juice_

_3 tablespoons orange juice_

_2 tablespoons brown sugar_

_1 tablespoon blanched slivered almonds_

Preheat the broiler.

Brush a small, flameproof baking dish (a small aluminum or foil tray will do) with half the butter. Split the bananas in half, lengthwise, and lay them in the dish. Mix the lemon and orange juice and pour it over the bananas. Brush the bananas with the remaining butter, and sprinkle with brown sugar.

Place under broiler for about 4 minutes or until bananas are lightly browned. Sprinkle almond slivers over bananas and put them under broiler for another minute or two, or until almonds are browned. Remove from broiler.

To serve: Serve the bananas hot. This dish should be prepared just before eating.

## _Fried dates_

SERVES 4–6

This simple dessert is popular among the Bohris of Gujarat. If you like dates and chewy, sticky caramely things, you will love this. It takes just a few minutes to make and should be cooked just before serving.

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil orusli ghee_

_2 cups (8 ounces) pitted good-quality dates_

_1 tablespoon slivered unsalted pistachios_

_1 cup heavy cream_

Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over a medium flame. When hot, put in the dates. Stir them around for 10 to 20 seconds. Remove with slotted spoon and place in serving dish.

Add pistachios to cream and put in serving pitcher.

To serve: Pass around the dates as well as the pitcher with the cream and nuts. The cream should be poured over the hot dates.

## _Shahi tukra_

SERVES 4

This popular dessert is made out of white bread rectangles, milk, and saffron.

_3 whole cardamom pods, slightly crushed_

_4 cups milk_

_2 teaspoons sugar plus 1 tablespoon sugar_

_¼ teaspoon leaf saffron,roasted and crumbled_

_4 tablespoons vegetable oil_

_3 slices of stale homemade-type white bread, ¾ inch thick, crusts removed, and each slice cut into 4 rectangles_

GARNISH

_Vark, if available_

_1 tablespoon sliced blanched almonds_

_1 tablespoon slivered unsalted pistachios_

Put the cardamom pods and 1 cup of the milk into a small pot and bring to a boil. Turn off heat. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and the saffron. Mix. Set aside.

In another pot (heavy-bottomed) bring the other 3 cups of milk to a boil. Turn heat down and reduce milk by half to 1½ cups (see note). This may take 35 to 45 minutes.

In a 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over medium temperature. When hot, put in the rectangles of bread. Fry until both sides turn golden brown. This should take about a minute on each side. You may need to add a bit more oil. Pour out oil if any is left.

Pour the saffron milk over the bread and let it sit for 5 minutes. Turn the rectangles over once during this period.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar to the boiled-down milk and pour this over the bread as well. Bring the contents of the skillet to a boil. Lower heat and simmer 10 minutes. Turn bread gently once or twice with a long spatula.

Lift bread gently and place on a rimmed platter for serving. Any flat dish with a shallow rim will do.

Allow to cool. Garnish with vark, almonds, and pistachios. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Serve cold.

## _Malpua_

SERVES 6

This is a pancake immersed in a sugar syrup.

_1¼ cups sifted dl-purpose white flour_

_½ cup milk_

_¾ cup heavy cream_

_3 cups sugar_

_2 cardamom pods, slightly crushed_

_3 tablespoons vegetable oil (more may be needed)_

Mix the flour, milk, and cream with a whisk. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Make the syrup by combining the sugar, 2 cups of water, and the cardamom pods in a pot. Bring to a boil without stirring. Lower heat and simmer 2 to 3 minutes, or until all the sugar dissolves. Put syrup into serving bowl large enough to hold pancakes as well.

Heat the oil in a 10–12-inch skillet over a medium flame. Pour in enough batter to make two 4–5-inch pancakes at a time. Cook pancakes slowly so they get golden brown and crisp. As each two pancakes are done, lift them out and put them into the syrup. Finish all the batter this way. Adjust heat so as not to burn pancakes, and add more oil as you require it. There should be about 3 tablespoons of oil in the skillet constantly.

_Malpua_ can be served either at room temperature or slightly warm. Bring bowl of pancakes and syrup to table. Each person should serve himself—only the pancakes, not any of the syrup.

## _Kheer_

SERVES 4

This is my mother's recipe for _kheer_ , a dessert made with milk and rice. _Please_ do not call it a "rice pudding." This sweet has been served to kings at banquets and to brides at wedding ceremonies—in no way does it resemble the stodgy rice pudding seen around in the Western Hemisphere!

When my mother made the _kheer_ she set it in shallow half-baked earthenware bowls called _shakoras_. As a result, it picked up the delicious fragrance of freshly moistened earth. You could serve your _kheer_ in individual custard bowls, or, if you prefer, you could put it all in one shallow bowl from which each person would serve himself.

_4 cups milk_

_1 tablespoon long-grain rice_

_4 whole cardamom pods, slightly crushed_

_1 tablespoon sugar_

_10 pistachios, unsalted and slivered, plus a few more for garnishing_

_Vark, if available_

Combine the milk, rice, and cardamom pods in a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to boil. Lower heat and reduce milk until you have 2 cups. This may take about 1¼ hours. Turn off heat.

Remove cardamom pods and discard. Add sugar and nuts. Mix well. Leave to cool.

Mix again. Pour into serving bowl. Decorate with _vark_. Sprinkle a few more slivered pistachios on top of the _vark_. Cover bowl with light plastic wrap. Refrigerate.

Serve cold.

## _Gulab jamun_

SERVES 6–8

This is a simple, very sweet dessert which can be served warm or at room temperature. It is made with dried milk. You could call it "fried milk balls in syrup."

_4 cups granulated sugar_

_3 cardamom pods, slightly crushed_

_2 cups powdered milk_

_½ cup all-purpose white flour_

_½ cup melted vegetable oil_

_½ cup milk_

_Vegetable oil for deep frying, enough to have 3 inches in pot_

First make the syrup. In a 4-quart pot, combine 4 cups water, the sugar, and the cardamom. Lower heat. Simmer 2 to 3 minutes, or until all the sugar has been dissolved. Do not stir.

Pour half the syrup into a serving bowl (about a 3-quart size). Leave the other half in the pot, with the cardamom pods.

Combine the powdered milk, flour, oil, and milk in a bowl. Make a soft dough. Make small, smooth balls out of the dough, each about 1 inch in diameter. You should be able to make more than 2 dozen _jamuns_.

Heat oil for deep frying in wok, _karhai_ , or any heavy-bottomed wide pot. You should have at least 3 inches of oil. Keep on _low_ flame. The _jamuns_ need to be fried _slowly_.

Put a _jamun_ into the oil as a test. If it begins to brown immediately, your heat is too high. Each _jamun_ should take 4 to 5 minutes to get a reddish brown color on all sides. If the first _jamun_ does not turn out right, correct the heat. It is better to take this precaution than have a whole batch burn outside and stay raw inside.

Now put in 6 _jamuns_ at a time. Turn them over as they turn reddish brown on one side. As they get fried, put them into the syrup in the pot. Bring this syrup to a boil. Let each batch simmer in the syrup for 5 minutes. When the _jamuns_ are "syruped," lift them out with a slotted spoon and place them in the fresh syrup in the serving bowl. Keep frying and "syruping" a batch at a time—as one batch fries, another can "syrup" until they are all done. When cool, cover serving bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. The syrup in the pot can now be discarded.

To serve: _Gulab jamuns_ can be served cold, at room temperature, or slightly warmed. Remember, you serve yourself only the _gulab jamun_ , not the syrup in the bowl!

# _And, to end, would you care for a paan?_

The guest has eaten well. Reluctantly, he heaves himself off a low divan and makes his way to the front door. Good-byes and see-you-soons are buzzing about his ears. Then the hostess descends upon him with yet another large silver tray. It is the final offering—one he just _cannot_ refuse. It is _the paan_ , or the betel leaf. He picks one up delicately with the tips of his right thumb and forefinger, opens his mouth wide, arches his body forward so it will not catch the staining spill, if any, and then stuffs the large _paan_ into his mouth. He goes out into the moonlight licking his lips and chewing contentedly.

The _paan_ has rounded off his meal as nothing else could and has left him with a feeling of immense and unique well-being. He is not alone in this. After a good meal, most Indians go hunting for a good _paan. Paan_ and cigarette stalls dot all neighborhoods just as candy and cigarette shops do in America. Indians abroad ache for it and dream of the day when they will be back on home soil, where they can buy it around the corner. I recall once, while doing an Urdu radio program at the United Nations headquarters, a group of us Indians and Pakistanis were interrupted in our rehearsal by a Pakistani gentleman who had (hush) smuggled a solitary _paan_ past the X-ray eyes of a New York customs inspector. (The betel leaf, being a green living thing, is not allowed into the country before thorough examination and, I suspect, quarantine! By that time the living thing is quite dead!) This gentleman came into the studio, waving _the paan_ with a look of smug achievement. There was quiet for a second. Then, like wild demons, we all leaped upon him, snatched the _paan_ , tore it into equal shreds, and devoured the scraps that fell to our lot. We were very ashamed and embarrassed afterwards as we handed the Pakistani gentleman his share, watched him eat it, straighten his tie, cough, and leave the studio without a word exchanged. There was no excuse except that it was unpremeditated! This is what a _paan_ can do to Indians and Pakistanis! While _paans_ are now available in England, they are still a rare—and illegal—sight in America.

What exactly _is_ a _paan_ , and is there a substitute that can be eaten? The _paan_ leaf is heart-shaped, 4 to 5 inches in length, and varies in taste from sweet to slightly bitter. The two commonest types are the _Benaresi_ leaf (small, tender, sweet, and yellowish green) and the _desi_ leaf (large, crisp, slightly bitter, and dark green). A _paan_ costs from a few cents up to $20 or $30, depending on what is wrapped inside it. At its simplest, this could be white lime paste, or _choona; katechu_ paste, or _kattha_ , a red paste made from the bark of a tree, which stains the mouth red; and chopped betel nuts. Or the _paan_ can contain combinations of fennel, cardamom, clove, perfumed nuts and spices, expensive tobaccos, drugs, and aphrodisiacs. An aphrodisiac like crushed pearls naturally pushes up the price a bit! The stuffing is placed on the center of the leaf, and the leaf is then folded over in the shape of a flat triangle or a cone. Either shape is held in place by a clove, acting as a straight pin.

In private homes, _paans_ are kept in _paandaans—brass_ or silver boxes with compartments and trays to hold all the spices, nuts, and leaves. (A lot of the "Indian brass boxes" sold in American stores are really the outside shells of _paandaans.)_ While the _paan_ leaf is unavailable in America, a great many of the spices are obtainable, and can easily be served after meals to departing guests. Here are some of them. Put them into silver or glass bowls or place them in tiny mounds on a silver tray.

BETEL NUTOR _SUPARI_ | This is a round, hard nut, requiring a special cutter _(sarota)_ to cut it into sections. You can, however, get it already cut up. To the uninitiated, it seems hard, unyielding, and fairly tasteless. It does soften if sucked for long. It has a unique mild taste, which needs, perhaps, to be acquired.  
Much easier on the palate are the scented and powdered _suparis_ available in packages at many specialty stores. They are often mixed with other seeds, nuts, and spices. If you ever travel Air India, along with the candy offered at takeoff and landing they will also offer you tiny packets of scented _supari_.  
---|---  
CARDAMOM OR _ELAICHI_ | Indians eat whole pods as well as the separated seeds. There are two varieties of pods available in America: one slightly greenish and the other off-white. The green one is much better for eating. The seeds are sucked and chewed slowly, allowing the flavor to linger in the mouth. In India the cardamom seeds can also be bought scented and covered with _vark_.  
FENNEL SEEDS OR _SONF_ | These are easy to buy and very refreshing to taste. Their slightly nutty, slightly licoricelike flavor is very popular with all my American friends. Though you can eat them raw, they taste better if they are dry-roasted first. Dry-roast about a cupful at a time by placing the seeds in a heavy-bottomed skillet over a medium flame and stirring them until the seeds get very lightly browned. Cool and store in a lidded jar. In the Punjab, fennel is served with _misri_ , grains of old-fashioned rock candy.  
CLOVESOR _LONG_ | Indians actually suck cloves. They break off and discard the small, peppercornlike ball on the top of the clove, which is too sharp (not all cloves have it), and pop the rest into their mouths like candy. It is very refreshings—and not as harmful to the teeth! You will often see fashionable young Indian misses take out little silver boxes from their little silver purses, remove cloves and cardamom seeds from them, and delicately place these spices on their tongues when mouth fresheners seem suddenly called for!

NOTE

Every store that has a mail-order business is willing to label ingredients that are ordered by mail. It is useful to request that your orders be labeled because it is often difficult to decipher the various spices unless you are familiar with Indian cooking.
