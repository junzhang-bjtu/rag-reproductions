#  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Creating a book of this scope takes, it seems, more than a village, and so I have unabashedly drawn upon all of the villages in which I've lived these past twenty years. Let me begin by thanking my wife, Susan, who endured yet another round of marathon writing bursts, supporting me with patience and lots of tea and vitamins.

The Ten Speed team has been fantastic at every level. Thanks begin with Publisher Kirsty Melville and Editorial Director Lorena Jones. Aaron Wehner, my editor, has been an exemplar of enthusiasm and sage guidance, proving again that behind every successful writer is a great (and over-worked) editor. Art Director Nancy Austin is not only talented but also great to work with, establishing a warm, collegial atmosphere and encouraging creative ferment. Ten Speed's enormous support for this project has, I believe, evoked from me the fullness of my potential. Thank you also to Andrea Chesman, Sharon Silva, Linda Bouchard, and Ken DellaPenta for expert copyediting, proofreading, and indexing, respectively.

Ron Manville poured his heart and soul into the photography. I was extremely fortunate, upon moving to Providence, to find someone so close to home who could capture in images the vision that was in my head. It was a joy to work with him. Our creative cabal was completed by Linnea Leeming, who brought us incredible energy and joy, along with her inventive prop styling.

Johnson & Wales University, my haven of the past two years, has also supported this project with great enthusiasm. I'm especially indebted to Dean Karl Guggenmos, who allowed me to use the labs and classrooms for testing and photography, and to my department chair, Martha Crawford who, as a world-class competition pastry chef, truly understood the nature of this undertaking. Thanks also to Pamela Peters, the director of culinary education, for her unflagging support and consistently positive attitude. The university's leadership team, including Dr. John Yena, John Bowen, Dr. Irving Schneider, Tom Wright, and Tom Farrell, sets a tone of inspiration and forward thinking. Assistant Public Relations Director, Linda Beaulieu, has been fantastic in helping me spread news of the bread revolution. A special thanks to my colleague Steve Kalble, a great teacher and one of the most passionate bread bakers I've ever known. Thanks also to Ciril Hitz, pastry instructor and bread _artiste,_ who taught me many shaping techniques even while he was in training for the 2002 Coupe du Monde competition. The entire faculty at Johnson & Wales inspires me with their commitment to education and their love of the transmission of knowledge. They are, collectively, my current mentors.

My students are also my teachers, but a few must be singled out for their special contributions, helping enormously with the photo shoot and covering for me on their own time when I was on crutches. Fumie Shibazaki (pictured on the cover), Alex Molnar, Jennifer Passarella, and Rina Hosaka make me proud to be a teacher.

Before Johnson & Wales I was nurtured at the California Culinary Academy where I first began my exploration of _pain à l'ancienne._ While there, I was privileged to work with chefs Robert Parks, Reg Elgin, Tony Marano, Nick Snell, and many others, including Greg Tompkins, who is now doing great work for Starbucks. Thanks also to my former CCA student, Peter DiCroce, for his passion for _pane siciliano_ that led to the breakthrough formula in this book.

Thank you to that unique fellowship known as the Baker's Dozen and its founders, Marion Cunningham and Flo Braker, along with my fellow bread chapter editors Fran Gage and Carol Field, and all the other chapter editors. After seven years of brainstorming and editorial meetings and countless recipe testing workshops, _The Baker's Dozen Cookbook_ is coming out, amazingly, the same month as this book. I learned so much about baking and the love of baking by being a part of that group.

Three local Providence bakeries contributed their support and their loaves for some of the photos. Providence, like so many cities around the country, is experiencing the bread revolution through both old and new bakeries that are adopting the slow rise fermentation principles that are causing so much excitement. Thanks to Lynn Rammrath of Seven Stars Bakery, Olga Bravo of Olga's Cup and Saucer, and Mike Manni of LaSalle Bakery for making great bread and leading the way in bringing a new level of bread awareness to Providence.

The Bread Bakers Guild of America, as always, is at the heart of the knowledge contained in this book. Didier Rosada, Greg Mistell, Peter Franklin, Amy Scherber, Toy Dupree, and Craig Ponsford are among the hundreds of bakers who have influenced me and who have changed the bread landscape in America.

Thanks to Tim and Crystal Decker for letting me showcase them in these pages as examples of the next wave of great bakers. And we all owe a huge debt to Professor Raymond Calvel, who I hope is proud to know that he has fulfilled his mission and passed on his wisdom to an entire generation.

Lionel Poilâne, Philippe Gosselin, and my Paris liaison, Stephanie Curtis, are the French trio who, unknowingly to any of us at the time, were the sparks that triggered this book. That trip would not have happened had it not been for Nick Malgieri and the James Beard Foundation who organized the competition that sent me on my pilgrimage.

There are more than 100 recipe testers to whom I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude. Most of them are members of the Bread Baker's List, an e-mail fellowship created by Reggie and Jeff Dwork that brings me a never-ending steady stream of knowledge. The following people voluntarily tested recipes and sent superb feedback that was essential for fine-tuning the formulas: Dena Allbee, Treece Ames, Burleigh Angle, Claire Banasiak, Lorraine Begley, Kevin Bell, Deborah Bergh, Bill Bowers, Terri Brooks, Bonni Lee Brown, Dawn Burstyn, Frank Cavalier, Taimi Clark, Bev Collins, Margaret Cope, Corky Courtright, Chris Dalrymple, Carolyn Dandalides, Kathy DeStudio, Barbara Edwards, Marilee Evans, Jill Farrimond, Ellen H.G. Fenster, Rosemary Finch, Natalie Fine, Cynthia Frederick, Jo Gould, Jim Gribble, Sharon Hale, Patty Hambelton, Lois Hansen, Dulcey Heller, Jane Helwig, Jenny Hensley, Bernice Hicks, Carolyn Hollenbeck, George Hower, Alan Jackson, Beth Jarvis, Claire Johnson, Keith Johnson, Mary Jo Kingston, Eve Kinney, Rhonda Kirschman, Pat Kleinberg, Jana Koca, Susan Kristof, Jim Lawler, Dorothea Lerman, Cindy Lewellen, Heidi Lisitsky, Les Lloyd, Charlene Magee, Alexandra Mahoney, Lindell Martin, Tuffy Mattox, Justin McAteer, Yvonne McCarthy, Lynne Miles, John Murren, Jill Myers, Erin Nesmith, Lorna Noble, Valerie Norton, Ed Okie, Larronna Payne, Charles D. Perry, Larry Peters, Bill Potere, Anne Ranish, Matt Ream, Heather Reseck, Joni Respasch, Dick and Willis Richards, Maureen Riley, Shauna Roberts, Wendy Robinson, Debbie Rogers, Joanne Sawyer, Barbara Schmitt, Pat Schuster, Dan Schwartz, Jackie Silberg, Philip Silverman, Amy Smereck, Bill Snider, Jennifer Somerville, Sherri Staat, Dawn Swindells, Donal Thacker, Susan Thomas, Maggie Tucker, Terry Vlassack, Rhea M. Vogelhut, Cynthia Ware, Diana Warshay, Jon Westfall, Jo Ann Wiese, Allan Wirth, Joan Wolckenauer, John Wright, Rita Yaezel, Tamera Yoakum, and Michael Zusman.

Finally, I'm indebted to my agent, Pam Bernstein, for all of her support, counsel, and encouragement.

#  INTRODUCTION

_Acorns were good enough until bread was invented._  
–Decimus Junius Juvenalis, A.D. 125

I used to be a professional baker, happily making bread in beautiful Sonoma County, California. Somehow, through a series of events complexly intertwined with many other facets of my life, I now find myself a teacher of bread baking at the world's largest culinary school, Johnson & Wales University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Rhode Island itself isn't much bigger than Providence, the entire state seeming like a large metropolitan area consisting of the city and its suburbs, the whole of which is smaller than Sonoma County. Rhode Island is quite beautiful in its own way, but it is not the charm and beauty that brought me to either Sonoma County or Providence. I chronicled this journey in a recent book, so I won't rehash its intricacies, but I will sum up one of the themes: Having learned so much from many teachers during my own life's apprenticeship, I find a great deal of meaning and purpose in transmitting knowledge, whether it be about bread or any other aspect of life. Producing successful students gives me even more pleasure than producing successful bread.

Since my first book, _Brother Juniper's Bread Book: Slow Rise As Method and Metaphor,_ was published more than ten years ago, dozens of superb bread books have appeared. These include recipe collections with hundreds of variations on every type of bread imaginable, from every culture, with infinite shapes and blends of grains. The Baker's Catalogue, produced by the good people at King Arthur Flour (see Resources), has grown from a sort of underground journal to a popularly discussed source of supplies and folklore among the thousands of "bread-heads" sprouting like malted barley across the country. Bread machines have become common household gadgets, and many of them are actually being used and are not just sitting on the counter like last year's toy. The recipe books for bread machines are among the best sources for esoteric single-loaf recipes, some of them of the family-heirloom variety. Whenever I want quick information on the "back story" of a particular type of bread, usually in response to a question from one of my students, one of the first places I check is my collection of bread-machine recipe books. "World encyclopedia" books on bread, "ultimate" books on bread, books on artisan breads and the bakers who make them, and numerous websites and e-groups dedicated solely to the growing national passion for bread baking have also become part of the bread landscape.

I wanted to call one of my recent books _The Bread Revolution,_ but that sounded too militant ("After all, what are they revolting against?" one editor asked me). We tried _Bread Renaissance,_ but I thought that sounded too elitist, and the most famous person who made a snobbish remark about bread, Marie Antoinette, lost her head over it ("Let them eat brioche," she was reported to have shouted when asked for her final words). After serious brainstorming, we came up with _Crust & Crumb: Master Formulas for Serious Bread Bakers,_ and I'm glad we did, I loved the sound of that title and so did many readers who commented on its aptness. It allowed me to pursue what I think of as my personal teaching mission: synthesizing information and reformulating it into usable knowledge for current times. The "master formula" concept helped home bakers, and even some professional ones, take a step away from recipe dependence toward thinking like a baker. This means thinking formulaically and structurally and then baking by an elusive quality called _feel,_ not just blindly following a recipe without knowing the reasons behind certain steps.

Knowledge is power, and I think a teacher's job is all about the empowerment of his or her students, regardless of the subject. A bread baker, like any true artisan, must have the power to control outcomes. This concept of empowerment is a universal principle and one of the reasons I love teaching. It's what made ancient craft guilds so important and powerful. Whether the aspiring artisan was a baker, carpenter, mason, butcher, candlestick maker, or chef, a guild apprenticeship put initiates on common ground with others, establishing a shared understanding of what made life meaningful. Coupled with religious influences, and the basic three R's, guild training was a foundation peg in keeping the spirit of quality, beauty, and goodness alive in the world. With this new book, I want to forge into the next frontier with you, beyond simply making bread, and on to explore its possibilities from the inside out in order to empower you to control the outcomes of your bread-baking pursuits. My goal is to teach you to fly without controls, by feel, the way a good pilot must from time to time.

When I began writing this book, my working title was _Deconstructing Bread._ It is a cute phrase but, as any philosophy student knows, true deconstructionism is a rather austere course. It means stripping away romance and myth and looking at the thing itself, without preconceived biases and notions. As anyone who has read my previous work knows, I am not a deconstructionist. I love myth and romance and, in fact, think bread is the perfect mythic symbol to explain the meaning of life. If making bread were simply clinical, bread would not have such a powerful influence in our lives, both historically and spiritually. So my goal in breaking it down to its essence runs into treacherous ground. I want to pop out on the other side, like our baking guild forebears, into a place where the mythic and romantic have even more power and bring us even more joy, because we have achieved a new level of understanding.

In _The Bread Baker's Apprentice,_ we are going to examine bread through the framework of the classic twelve stages of baking. This is the structure that forms the broad strokes of our inquiry and gives us a context. Within that context we will go deeper and deeper, establishing infrastructure along the way. My goal is _not_ to make you into a dogmatically doctrinal baker, what I call a letter-of-the-law baker. Instead, I want to help you become a spirit-of-the-law baker. That is, one who has a sense of what the options are and thus is free to choose the options that will bring about the desired outcomes. I want to turn you into a baker who might even transcend structure and break through into new frontiers, applying knowledge to make bread that pushes the envelope. This kind of freedom can only come, as the universal principles converge with baking principles, when you have mastered the outer form and structures, or at least understand them. Mastery comes with practice. Understanding comes from hanging in there with me, keeping an open mind, and also revisiting your other baking books with a fresh eye (don't ever abandon those classics!).

There are not hundreds of formulas in this book, but there are many—more than fifty—enough to empower you to make extraordinary versions of these classics, sometimes using innovative techniques that can then be applied to any other recipe or formula you encounter elsewhere. After years of baking, I have discovered that while everyone has certain favorite breads, some sentimental preferences related to taste memories, some for cultural reasons, it is not the exotic flavor or the innovative ingredient that brings one back again and again to a particular loaf. It is the perfect execution in that bread of the manipulation of time and temperature, evoking the fullest potential of flavor from the grain. That is what creates excitement and buzz. I have long contended that pizza will be memorable, regardless of how fancy the toppings are, only if the crust is truly great (and how few there are that meet this standard). It is the same with all bread, not just pizza dough.

Since I have promised you an adventure, we will begin with a story in the first chapter before getting into the nuts and bolts of the process. After that, I will explain my baking assumptions and choices so that you will understand how to follow the master formulas that ensue, and then we will begin the process itself, applying the unfolding concepts to a number of master formulas.

#  _Part I:  
What Is It About Bread?_

On August 7, 1999, on a drizzly, chilly day typical to the region, thousands of pilgrims flooded a four-block area of southwest Portland, Oregon, in a park near Portland State University. They didn't come for religious reasons but to venerate with religious zeal their newly emerged passion for the world's most symbolically evocative foodstuff: bread. Not just bread, but good-as-it-gets bread, made by artisans of the Pacific Northwest using techniques discovered either accidentally or from the dissemination of arcane knowledge brought to this country only recently by European bakers through the Bread Bakers Guild of America, itself a throwback to days of yore. The Summer Loaf Festival, as it is called, is one of the first of what may soon be a nationwide parade of tributes to the hottest food trend since, well, sliced bread. (Note: The Summer Loaf Festival is not the actual first bread festival, which occurred two years earlier in Sonoma County, California, and was called, cleverly, the Grainaissance Fair.)

The French call it simply _pain ordinaire,_ "ordinary bread." What the new, young American bakers have discovered, and what they proudly displayed in dozens of booths at Summer Loaf, is that there are many layers of flavor hidden within the four ingredients of flour, water, salt, and yeast that are the sole components of true French bread. They have taken up the timeless baker's challenge of evoking from the wheat its fullest potential, finding ways of unraveling the tasteless starch molecules that comprise the bulk of a loaf by attempting to spring free the simple sugars that are woven within the complex but unassailable carbohydrates. When they successfully accomplish this, using bakers' tricks that are both ancient and modern, layers of flavor emerge as if from one of those magic-eye, three-dimensional, there-it-is, wait-where-did-it-go paintings. Flavors slowly come into focus as the palate, with its five flavor zones, aided by the chewing process and the release of salivic enzymes, encounters it first in the sweet zone, eliciting an "ahhh, this is nice," reaction. Then the salty zone kicks in, an "oohhh," followed by another level of either sweetness or sourness (depending on the bread), along the sides of the tongue, calling forth a "hmnnn, whoaa...." Finally, just at the swallowing point, the mouth floods in the _umami,_ or rich zone in the back central region, with a nutlike flavor that perfumes its way into the sinuses, where it lingers for as long as fifteen to thirty minutes, re-creating with every inhalation the inimitable finish of a proper, world-class bread—the inevitable "yessss!" (accompanied by appropriate arm pumping, in rare instances). This flavor joy is in addition to the various auditory pleasures of the sound of crust, crackling and crumbling under the pressure of the chew, and the visual satisfaction caused by both the rich, dusty, reddish gold caramelization of crust and the blooming of the loaf along the slash marks. The blooming produces what the French call the _grigne,_ an ear of crisp crust that neatly separates from the loaf like a proudly curled lip. Bread this good must also be beautiful; after all, in our culinary schools it is taught that we eat first with our eyes.

I teach bread baking in a large culinary school. My students are mostly young wannabe and soon-to-be pastry chefs and bakers, and I have less than five weeks to teach them everything, or nearly everything I know about bread. What I'd like to do is first send them to Summer Loaf and Grainaissance festivals, or to Paris with its two hundred and fifty bread shops, so they can be swept into the romance of the bread revolution as I have been. Instead, what I am required to do is teach them formulas and how to safely work the ovens and use stationary and spiral mixers, powerful tools that will rip off their hands if they get too anxious and prematurely feel their dough. Since feeling the dough is really where the magic begins, I rapidly make my way through the boring but necessary safety requirements to get to the stuff of which baker's dreams are made. Usually somewhere around the third or fourth week, it—the magic—happens for most of my students.

In _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,_ a book that came out, coincidentally, around the same time as the Tassajara Bakery began selling bread made by American Zen Buddhist students in San Francisco, Robert Pirsig wrote of two kinds of motorcycle riders. Some like to tinker with their bikes, making sure they are tooled just right, and the others just like to ride and feel the wind against their cheeks. Bread bakers are like that, too. The more technical and mechanical bakers often go to Manhattan, Kansas, where there is a superb school called the American Institute of Baking. There they learn all about the properties of wheat and the effect of multitudinous sugars upon various strains of yeast. They learn dough formulas, and they learn about equipment options and methodologies. Graduates of this program become valuable technical bakers, usually for large companies, and earn good salaries, troubleshooting problems and guaranteeing consistency in operations that may produce forty thousand or more loaves a day.

The other type of baker, the wind-on-cheek baker, often opens a small bakeshop and makes what has become known as artisan bread, the term _artisan_ having been driven, sadly, to near meaninglessness by its recent ubiquity. These are the bakers who tend to rhapsodize about their loaves. ("They are _loaves,_ please don't call them products.") Many of them travel to Europe, making pilgrimages to the house of Poilâne or Ganachaud, and gather at bread bakers' guildhall meetings, held whimsically throughout the year, to discuss the merits of various baguette-shaping techniques or the hydration potential of their latest experimental ciabatta. They philosophize, read and write books, and argue about the ever-shifting line between the true artisan and the mass producer or the merits of supporting small-scale wheat farmers who grow heirloom strains. These bakers get very excited every time they learn a new technique or hear that the French professor Raymond Calvel might be coming to town. (That's not very likely these days, as the bread teacher of bread teachers is in his late eighties and has already committed his knowledge to a superb series of videos he made with the Bread Bakers Guild of America in 1994.) When they go to France, Germany, or anywhere where good bread might be found, they come back with new ideas and add ever more dialogue to the still-building buzz.

My students, being younger than these entrepreneurial bakers who have now changed the American bread paradigm, may become either technical or romantic bakers, or a hybrid of the two, or they may never get grabbed by the bread- _geist_. Many of them initially view my class as a necessary prerequisite to get them to the plated-dessert or wedding-cake class, but then find themselves inexplicably falling under the spell of _pain au levain, ciabatta al funghi,_ or _pain à l'ancienne._ Some fight against the discipline of repetitive drills, shaping baguette after baguette—not a simple matter—and trying in vain to match their slashes, or scoring cuts, in a consistent pattern. I never know on the first day who of my twenty or so students will emerge on the twenty-second day as bread revolutionaries, but I know some of them will. It usually happens before they taste the _pain à l'ancienne,_ but if it hasn't happened by then, that is the bread that seduces them. If it still doesn't happen, I pray, having taken my best shot, that they will discover their culinary awakening in the chocolate or cake class.

Many of my former students have long since graduated and are working in the field, sending e-mails or dropping in from time to time to share their "war" stories. A number of them tell me it was the _pain à l'ancienne_ that first grabbed hold of their imagination, and now that they are out and exposed to even more varieties, they can't seem to get bread out of their systems, even if they have become pastry chefs rather than bakers.

I learned about _pain à l'ancienne_ in Paris in 1996, when I went over to collect on my prize for winning the James Beard National Bread Competition in 1995. I won with a simple sourdough, a country _boule_ (ball), made with an unusually high proportion of sourdough starter. I baked my winning loaves at Amy's Breads on the west side of Manhattan, rushing them straight from Amy's many-thousand-dollar Bongard steam-injected oven into the trunk of my friend Joel's car. He's a locksmith and thus knows the fastest ways through town, and he safely delivered me and the bread to the James Beard House in Greenwich Village.

The Beard House is one of the meccas of the American food scene. When James Beard, the rotund food writer and America's most famous gourmand, died in 1982, a group of his friends and colleagues started a foundation in his memory to perpetuate interest in the burgeoning American culinary explosion. They eventually paid off the mortgage on his house and turned it into a sort of museum and dining showcase for upcoming and seminal chefs, regularly hosting theme meals prepared by various culinary artists brought to town for the occasion. They also bestow prestigious cookbook awards and honor the top American chefs every year at their gala, an Oscar-like ceremony aptly called the James Beard Awards.

The bread competition was organized for the Beard Foundation by author and teacher Nick Malgieri, the head baking instructor at the Peter Kump's New York Cooking School and a onetime acquaintance of the late James Beard. Prior to the finals, Nick traveled around the United States staging regional competitions, inviting the eight regional winners to New York for the final bake-off in January 1995.

I had won the California regional in October by unexpectedly defeating Craig Ponsford, who a few months later would win the world championship of breads at the Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie competition in Paris, the so-called Bread Olympics. I believe the California regional Beard competition was the only time Craig ever lost a head-to-head competition. When I, in false modesty, whispered to him after my name was announced, "I can't believe it," he understandably responded, "Me neither." His loaves were a multigrain sourdough, perfectly formed, loaded with complex flavors, made at Artisan Bakers, his bakery in Sonoma. My two large sourdough _boules,_ made from a starter I'd been cultivating for about three months, were baked at home on a pizza stone and spritzed with water from a plant mister. It was an experimental dough, using a ratio of about 80 percent starter to flour, very unusual as most sourdoughs use only about 25 to 35 percent starter to flour. The loaves came out of the oven somewhat misshapen, having spread sideways and upward. The cuts were okay but not particularly attractive, blooming to form only a slight _grigne_ but without creating any ears. The crust had a wonderful golden glow and was blistered from the long overnight proofing in my refrigerator. By true French standards this would not have been a winning bread, but on that particular day, with those particular judges, the rustic quality and the bold sour flavors gave it a small edge over Craig's perfect, but less rustic, loaves. I happily collected my regional prize, which was a free trip to New York City to compete in the finals, knowing I would have to do better to stand any chance of winning the real prize: a week in Paris to study with the _boulanger_ of my choice.

There is a huge difference between baking bread in a real bread oven and a home oven, but even the best oven cannot produce great bread if the dough itself is not fermented properly. Fermentation is the key to world-class bread, assuming that the flour and other ingredients are good. I was able to win the regional event because I had great dough going into the less-than-great electric oven in my home. Compensating for a lack of real steam with plant misters and other oven tricks to simulate the blast of steam a good Bongard, Tibbouletti, or Werner-Pfleiderer hearth oven produces was an audacious, but successful, attempt to prove a point. In my opinion, the quality of the dough is responsible for at least 80 percent of the finished product, while the oven is worth only about 20 percent. When I got to Amy's Breads, I was able to create an even better dough than my regional batch, having had three months of practice to refine my formula and mixing times.

Amy Scherber and Toy Dupree, the owners of Amy's Breads, were kind enough to let me work around their production schedule during the competition. Amy is one of the leading personalities in the American bread revolution, a founding board member of the Bread Bakers Guild of America, and a smart businesswoman. One of the signature items at Amy's Breads is a semolina twist that simply flies off the shelf. Her bread confirmed my own growing interest in semolina breads, or _pane siciliano,_ which is a good example of how the bread revolution spreads.

Making bread in someone else's bakery is a challenge, and I had to estimate fermentation times based on ambient temperature because Amy's did not, at that time, have a temperature-controlled proof box. One of the keys to my formula is leaving the shaped loaves in the refrigerator overnight for their final slow-rise fermentation (we call it retarding the dough). This allows the bacterial fermentation to catch up to the wild-yeast fermentation (two types of fermentation plus a whole lot of enzyme action are at the heart of sourdough bread) and allows the starches to unwind into sugars as the dough slowly rises to its appropriate prebake size. When I arrived the following morning to bake off the loaves, I discovered I had miscalculated the temperature of the walk-in refrigerator, and my loaves were far from ready to go into the oven. I had to find a way to warm them, to wake them up, so that they could complete their rise. Without a proof box on a cold, snowy New York morning, I was at the mercy of ingenuity. Amy told me the warmest place in the bakery was at the top of the stairs leading to the basement. "That's where I put my doughs when they're too small," she advised. "But watch out for the stairs—don't let the racks roll down," was her final warning. I rolled my two racks of shaped bread dough, each loaf nestled in a canvas-lined bentwood willow basket (or _banneton,_ as it is called in France) to the top of the stairs where a warm breeze drifted from the basement. It was 8 _a.m._ and I needed to have finished bread ready to transport by noon, when Joel would arrive to wend us through the icy streets to the Village. There was nothing I could do but wait and hope the dough would wake up and respond to the warmth with some movement. I parked the rolling racks at the top of the stairs, warning everyone on the production team not to jostle them lest they tumble into the abyss. I then went across Ninth Avenue to get a bagel and read the Sunday _Times,_ a pleasure I had been denied during the twenty-five years I lived in California.

Two hours later I returned to the bakery, relieved to find the racks still at the top of the stairs, but the dough was still undersized. I decided that 11 _a.m_. was my drop-dead time. I killed the hour by hanging out with the bakers, shaping loaves with them, talking bread philosophy—the usual baker stuff—and then took my loaves, still looking too small, to the oven, hoping they'd give me a good oven spring when the steam engulfed them. I had made two sizes: a nineteen-ounce _bâtard,_ or torpedo-shaped loaf, and some three-pound _miches,_ or large _boules._ I lined them up on the conveyor loader, scored them with either crosshatch pound signs, angled slashes, or asterisk stars, and pushed the conveyor into the eight-foot-deep oven deck. This action engaged the flanges of the loader into special brake slots, and then I pulled the conveyor out of the oven as it neatly dropped the loaves, one by one, onto the stone deck. After the deck was loaded, I pushed the steam button, causing a large blast of steam to billow out into the oven for twenty seconds. The steam moistened the skins of the dough to prevent them from gelatinizing too quickly, allowing the loaves to spring to their full size as the yeast completed its final feeding frenzy, at least until the center of the loaves reached 140°F, killing the last of that most useful of fungi. The oven kick, as it's called, usually produces a size increase of 10 to 15 percent. But on this particular day, in that particular oven, with my particular dough, the loaves kicked a whopping 20 percent, bloomed open perfectly, producing _grignes_ distinct enough to allow me to carry each loaf by its ear. The caramelization of the crust, the distinct Maillard reaction unique to bread and just a few other products, was a rich golden brown with tones of red, so soothing to the eye, so appealing and appetizing that it could, and did, induce tears.

As if on cue, Joel pulled up to the shop, moved his locksmithing tools around in the trunk to make room, and helped me load the bread, about thirty loaves, into empty flour sacks. Then it was hugs to the bakers, good luck, good luck, good luck, thank you, thank you, thank you, and we were off to the Beard House. Once there, we chose the two most perfect specimens for the judges, placed the others under the table, went around the corner to a café for cappuccino and hot chocolate, and caught up on old times knowing there was nothing more we could do but wait for the judging. Joel had just sold a book of locksmith stories to a publisher, and I had just sold a bread-book concept to a different publisher, so we talked writer talk instead of bread talk. It's very similar.

An hour later we went back for the announcements. The competitor whose bread impressed me the most was Biagio Settepani of the Bruno Bakery in Brooklyn. His loaves were not as visually stunning as mine, but the flavor was spectacular, with a sweet, creamy crumb that was as satisfying as a bowl of Cream of Wheat on a cold winter morning. He and his young son worked at the opposite side of the table from me as we, and the other finalists, cut small slices of our loaves for the hundreds of guests and spectators to taste. The other competitors had flown in from Texas, Oregon, Washington, St. Louis, and Boston. All the breads were wonderful. One was a four-pound rye bread with a cocoa-stenciled floral design baked onto the crust. Another looked just like my loaves, but the inside, the crumb, was tighter and a little dry. Mine were probably the best I'd ever baked: the inside and outside, the crumb and the crust, perfectly matched, the flavor and texture of the crumb, its mouth feel, cool and creamy even while still warm from the oven (with bread, the antithesis of cool is not warm but dry). The sour was properly complex, changing flavors in the mouth with each chew. What I call the "loyalty factor" kicks in just after swallowing, as the lactic and acetic acids produced by the bacterial fermentation work their way into the sinuses for the "thirty-minute finish." When the judges announced that I had won, I was relieved but not shocked. If not then, then never. I called my wife, Susan, in Santa Rosa, and when she answered the phone, I sang the first few words of "La Marseillaise." She squealed with delight. We were going to France.

It took a year and a half to arrange the logistics for the trip. The prize money made available from Godiva Chocolate through the James Beard Foundation was supposed to be used to underwrite a one-week _stage,_ or training session, with a baker of my choice in Paris. Stephanie Curtis, an American living in Paris, was the liaison and I was told to contact her to work out the details. I asked her if it would be possible to meet with five bakers for one day each, rather than one baker for five days. I didn't really want to spend my time in Paris making bread while Susan went out alone to sightsee and shop. What I really wanted was a crash tour of the best bread bakers and enough time to interview them and pick their brains. I figured two hours per baker. My interest was as a writer and teacher more than as a commercial baker, and I was looking for a thread, something to bring back to my students that I didn't know and that they might not hear about any other way.

Stephanie was kind enough to rent us her second apartment, in Montmartre, and we took possession on a clear day in early June, excited to be in an exciting part of town, totally intimidated by the Parisian reputation and our own lack of worldliness. On our first foray to a café, Susan ordered us two bottles of _"avian."_ When the bartender started making engine sounds and flapping his arms, she realized her gaffe, correctly ordered "Evian," and, actually, it broke the ice for us. After that, Stephanie served as our translator and escorted us on the various bakery tours so we encountered no more "aeroplanes."

We got off to a rather weird beginning by getting thrown out of the Centre Technologique Ferrandi, the national academy of baking. Apparently, the instructor who approved our visit forgot to inform his superior, who was extremely upset when he saw us observing a class in session. No amount of explanation by either Stephanie or the instructor could convince him it was a simple communication error. He insisted we leave, which we did, but not before I had a chance to witness the young students. They were between sixteen and eighteen years old, doing some of their daily drills, each student responsible for shaping about fifty perfect baguettes and an equal number of croissants or Danish pastries, an exercise they would do for the two years of their training. I realized in that brief moment, before getting tossed out, the yin and the yang of the French national training. On the one hand, every graduate would have outstanding fundamental skills; on the other, he (and there were only men) would be too invested in certain methods to be open to unconventional or alternative approaches. Since only a rare apprentice would ever have the desire to break from the pack, this concern would seem, especially at such an early stage, to be of little consequence. The upside of such rigorous training highlighted the vast difference between the French and American systems. (Well, there isn't actually an existing American system, which is my point.)

Ferrandi's Monsieur B., as I shall call him, confirmed our initial fears that the French would be arrogant and nasty, but, fortunately, he turned out to be the exception. No other visit on our tour was anything but warm and pleasant. Stephanie took us to the Ritz Hotel where we had a tour of the bakeshop with master _boulanger_ and executive pastry chef Bernard Burban, who showed us, among other things, how the Ritz bakers made their signature _clafouti_ tartlets with brioche crusts.

The next day I visited L'autre Boulangerie, the bakery of Michel Cousin. What makes his operation unique is the unconventional variety of his bread offerings. Throughout the week he makes as many as thirty different types of bread, not all on the same day of course, but according to a menu of daily specials. He makes multigrains, sun-dried tomato loaves, various herb-and-cheese _bâtards,_ and gigantic loaves of rye that appear to weigh about six pounds each. He was the only baker I met who was interested in what American bakers were doing, where they were getting their ingredients, and how they came up with their ideas. In this sense, Cousin's bakery was American in spirit in that it reached for distinction instead of conformity, pushing the envelope of local customs and taking conceptual risks.

One of the things about American bread bakers that have allowed us to catch up so quickly to our better-trained and tradition-steeped European brethren is our unshackled nature. The yang of Ferrandi, its anchorage in very specific methodologies, is the yin of the American approach. In a society that values its bread a certain way, as the French do, it is not easy to break from the pack. In the States we haven't quite established if there is a pack and what it ought to look like. Having shared his vision of unbounded bread possibilities, I was pleased to be able to give back to M. Cousin the name of a friend of mine who produces sun-dried tomatoes in Healdsburg, California. "It is amazing how expensive it is to bring them in from Italy even though it's so close," Cousin remarked.

The next day we made one of our most anticipated visits, to the Latin Quarter and the Cherche-Midi location of Lionel Poilâne's mother-house bakery. The window was filled with two-kilo _miche_ s, the famous flour-crusted _pains Poilâne_ that have become the icon of the bread revolution. This is what the new breed of bread freak calls "real bread," made with whole-grain flour and wild-yeast pre-ferments. The loaves are big, heavy, crusty, and reputed to taste better on the third day than the first (Poilâne's own assessment of the flavors). He greeted us warmly with steaming coffee, tea, and croissants in his small office, the walls covered with dozens of canvases of bread art and the ceiling hung with a working bread-dough chandelier he'd made for Salvador Dali thirty-some years ago.

After the initial greetings, Poilâne escorted us down an old, flour-dusted, stone-and-mortar spiral staircase to the cavelike oven room in the basement of the building. Here we met one of his young apprentices, or disciples, since one of the Poilâne rules of hiring is that his apprentices not have worked at another bakery or been trained in one of the formal academies. "I have a vision, the Poilâne vision, of how bread should be made. It is too difficult to train one who has picked up the habits of the schools," he told us without pretension. In pressing for more details I was able to discern some of the critical points that drive this personal vision. Much has to do with commitments to the ingredients and to the baking process. As much of the work as possible should be done by hand, by one person taking responsibility for his loaves from start to finish—no assembly line. Each loaf is the expression of an artisan accurately following the methodology determined by Lionel Poilâne as he (and his brother Max, who also has quite a following at his own _boulangeries_ ) learned it from his father. The wood-fired oven, designed by Lionel, has no temperature gauge on it, forcing the baker to determine by feel when it is time to put in the loaves. Much of the training of a Poilâne apprentice gets involved developing a feel for the dough, the baker's touch.

The cave was barely big enough for the four of us and the apprentice. We watched the young baker work his station, peeling two dozen two-kilo loaves into the small aperture and onto the hot stone hearth. The stone deck was heated by bringing up the flames from the firebox below the baking deck, through a connecting hole filled by a curved metal tube that swiveled around to direct the flames into all the corners of the oven chamber. After the oven reached the proper temperature, the swivel was removed and the hole was covered by a metal bowl filled with water. As the water heated up, it provided a touch of moisture and preserved the even distribution of the heat.

The Poilâne loaves, these two-kilo country _miches,_ have become so distinctively associated with Poilâne that it is easy to forget that hundreds of other bakers throughout France make similar loaves called the same thing. They are round, not too high, about four inches thick and twelve inches in diameter, dusty with the excess surface flour from the _bannetons_ in which the unbaked dough has its final rise. The cut marks are done in a broad pound (#) sign, scored close to the edge of the loaf so as almost to square the circle. The dough includes some whole-wheat flour, unlike the more common baguette that is Paris's other great bread treasure. It is naturally leavened by a wild-yeast starter, passed from batch to batch, creating a distinctively sour, but not too sour, chewy, crusty bread designed to last a family for close to a week, the flavors changing each day as the bread tempers. The French do not prize sourness as, say, San Franciscans do. Poilâne insists that the peak flavor comes forth on the third day. I found it tasted best about three hours after emerging from the oven, but I am, after all, an unsophisticated American with an American's palate and thus less susceptible to the third-day subtleties of the well-tempered loaf.

M. Poilâne invited us to take a tour of his new _manufacture_ in Bièvres, about fifteen miles outside of Paris. It is here that Poilâne's arguably greatest contribution to the craft of modern artisan baking is found. In a round building in this suburban town, Poilâne has made a statement and a fortune producing thousands of his _miches_ for distribution throughout France and into foreign lands (a few dozen are shipped regularly to select American clientele in New York and Chicago). Here is how he does it: Around the circumference of the building, twenty-four ovens are strategically placed, each an exact replica of the older oven we saw in action back at Cherche-Midi. Each oven exists in a space—not as dungeonlike and charming as in Paris, but equally functional—that includes a dough mixer, a fermentation bin, an old-time baker's balance scale, a stack of _bannetons,_ and some long metal pans for the signature sandwich rye breads also made here. In the large arenalike center of the building, accessible by truck through big doors that open as needed, is the most impressive pile of firewood I have ever seen. Cord after cord after cord of hard French oak circumnavigate the hall, and above the woodpile, hovering like a master of ceremonies, is a claw on a track. Upon command, the claw scoops up some of the wood and transports it to a chute (there are twelve around the walls). Like an arcade gift game, the prized wood slides to an awaiting baker on the other side of the wall. The chutes deposit the wood in the space between every two bakeshops, from which the bakers collect it and stack it, and eventually build their own fires timed to peak and heat just when the dough is ready to be baked.

This ingenious design allows Poilâne to stay true to his vision of handcrafted loaves, each made by one and only one baker, each baker responsible for a mere three hundred loaves per day, but adding up to quite a number when all ovens are fired. At the time of our visit, only sixteen ovens were actually being used because, as Poilâne's production manager explained to us, the _manufacture_ (which literally means "made by hand") was designed with a ten-year growth plan in mind. It opened two years prior to our visit with only fourteen of the ovens in use, and each year one of the unused ovens is to be fired up and added to the operation. Each year a new baker must also be trained and added to the flock of what I call _le culte de Poilâne._ Eight years of growth potential remained for this location, at which time all the ovens will be in use and it will max out. If demand for the bread continues to exceed production, this will be accommodated not by forcing more production from each baker but by building a new facility. When I did the math, figuring that at wholesale prices of about ten dollars a loaf, plus the few other products like the rye bread and Poilâne's famous apple tarts, Boulangerie Poilâne must be doing close to twenty million dollars a year.

With these numbers dancing in my head, I took my two gift loaves home, the street folk of Montmartre staring with envy as they recognized not one but two loaves of Poilâne gold under my arm. One of the loaves lasted us the rest of the week. The other I took with me to dinner the following night along with a baguette from the Gosselin Boulangerie where, with my head still swimming with _la vision de Poilâne,_ I learned how to make _pain à l'ancienne._ Learning that technique was perhaps the single most important thing, at least bread thing, that happened to me on this trip.

Gosselin is a young man, perhaps in his early thirties, who presides over a small, not-too-fancy bakeshop on rue Saint-Honoré, not too far from the Louvre. Like many bakers, his revenue is derived in equal proportion from three main categories: bread, pastries, and lunch items, primarily sandwiches. The pastries and sandwiches appeared rather typical, and I wondered why Stephanie chose this place as one of the five definitive stops in my itinerary. The baguettes looked like those in most other shops, but next to them was a second rack of breads, looking like baguettes, only dustier with surface flour and not as deeply browned nor as distinctively scored (slashed). She pointed to those and said, "That's why I brought you here. This baguette, the _pain à l'ancienne,_ won the award for best in the city this year. You must try it."

Gosselin himself brought us into the back of his shop, proud to show off the improvements he'd made since taking over the operation and buying the place from the master baker with whom he'd apprenticed for five years. He led us down a staircase to an underground bakeshop, where we followed a strange-looking tube device that hugged the walls through the catacomb until it and we popped out into a perfect little pastry kitchen, with new ceramic tile walls and floors, climate controlled to maintain the ideal temperature of 60°F so necessary for chocolate and for butter-laminated pastries such as croissants and Danish pastries. It was clear that Gosselin was proud of this underground oasis, but I was still wondering about the wormy tube that we followed through the corridors.

"That," he explained through Stephanie, "is where the flour comes in." Eventually we were able to grasp the cleverness of the system. No one wants to carry fifty-pound sacks of flour down a staircase to a storeroom, so instead, a few times a week, a flour truck pulls up and blows the flour through the tube to a holding silo in the basement. From there the flour can be released through a gravity-feed device and scaled for mixing. Very easy, no heavy lifting, and voilà, everyone is happy.

In a room separate from the pastry shop, clearly not renovated, was the bread shop. Unlike some of the other _boulangeries_ we visited, like Boulangerie Ganachaud, birthplace of the _poolish_ (sponge-method) baguette, where wood-fired baking was an important part of the artisan image, Gosselin relied on a standard four-deck, gas-heated hearth oven with a conveyor loader. The oven is not where the Gosselin _pain à l'ancienne_ magic takes place, but in the fermentation technique. It is the most unique, and most improperly named, technique I have seen, relying on a method that cannot possibly be _à l'ancienne_ because it depends completely on the power of the refrigerator, a rather modern invention. The bread should be called _pain moderne,_ but then who would value it? The important difference between this dough and most others is that it is made by a delayed-fermentation technique caused by using ice-cold water to mix it, without yeast or salt, and then immediately refrigerating it. The dough is held overnight and then remixed with the yeast and salt and slowly awakened to begin its first, or bulk, fermentation. This technique evokes a whole different range of flavors and textures than is usually found in the standard 60-2-2 baguette, so called because it is, and has been for generations, made with 60 percent water, 2 percent salt, and 2 percent yeast to 100 percent flour. It is only in recent years, or at least in the post-Ganachaud years commencing in the 1960s, that bakers have played around with this sacred formula, pushing the envelope to create a better bread. Gosselin's _pain à l'ancienne_ was the best baguette I'd ever had, even better than the version made by Professor Raymond Calvel that I tasted at his French bread seminar in Berkeley in 1994.

Calvel is generally regarded as the teacher of teachers, the chemist who quantified the internal processes of dough fermentation, and then applied that knowledge as a baker to set the bar for French bread excellence in the 1950s. His was the best I'd ever tasted until Gosselin's, and the good professor, now deep into his eighties, never mentioned the _à l'ancienne_ technique during our seminar. As Gosselin generously explained the method, confident that the other local bakers wouldn't steal it because everyone in Paris hubristically thinks that his own bread is the best, I wondered if I had stumbled upon the next great thing, cold-dough delayed fermentation, the new frontier of bread making. I couldn't wait to get back home and try out Gosselin's method.

That evening I went to dinner at the home of an American who lives in Paris, where he translates, subtitles, and sometimes dubs French films into English and English language films into French. I told him on the phone that I'd bring the bread. He said, "That's okay, we have a great _boulangerie_ around the corner. I love their baguettes. I'll pick one up."

"But I have some _pain Poilâne_ and also a very special baguette I want you to try," I countered.

"Ohhh, _pain Poilâne._ Yes, do bring that, but don't worry about the baguette, really."

"You don't understand," I pressed. "This really is very special."

"Well, okay, if you must."

When I arrived I noticed a fresh baguette sitting on the counter next to the pot of _boeuf bourguignon_ he had made. I laid my _pain à l'ancienne_ next to it and saw him smile. He took the Poilâne loaf and rushed it into the living room to show his wife, a sweet Parisian woman who nodded happily when she saw it. "Oh, Poilâne. Max or Lionel?"

"Lionel, from Bièvres, not Cherche-Midi," I said. She raised her eyebrows, indicating that she didn't know about Bièvres. "It's the same, just a new facility," I assured.

Another friend arrived, also an American, a writer and performer who had found much success in France where it had eluded him in the States. We sat down to eat and Michael, our host brought out the bread with the stew. Howie, the writer-performer said, "Ah, _pain Poilâne,_ I see. But what's with the two baguettes?"

I explained about the Gosselin, and Michael said, "Well, let's see. Try this one; we're quite proud of it here in the neighborhood."

I tore off a piece and chewed it well. It was pleasant, not unlike the bread I purchased in Montmartre across from our apartment. In fact, not unlike most of the good baguettes in Paris, better than almost any found in the States, but...

"Okay, try the Gosselin," I said, pushing it over to Michael and Howie. They tore off chunks, and the first thing we all noticed was how much bigger the holes were than in typical baguettes. It was also creamier, not as white. Michael chewed off a bite, the crackle of crust slightly cracklier than the local bread's. I watched his face as he chewed, the realization that there was another level, never experienced even here in the baguette center of the universe, that was now entering his orbit. He visibly displayed a series of emotions on his face, swinging from smiling sublimity to furrowed anger, then back the other way. He was on a pendulum ride as the room grew silent and all attention focused gravitationally on him, getting weightier by the second. In my memory I see the lights getting dimmer, with a spotlight on Michael's face, but I know this is just a trick of my own mind. But what did happen was this: He slowly picked up his local baguette and looked at it, then looked at the _à l'ancienne_ baguette on the table, then back to the one in his clenched hand. As if in slow motion, he threw the local loaf against the wall where it smashed and fell to the floor. His wife said sharply, "Michael!"

Michael turned to me and said, "You've ruined me. Are you happy?"

"Yes, actually. I am happy," I said.

Then we all smiled and enjoyed dinner.

_Bentwood bannetons, or proofing baskets_

I often participate in an event called the Book and the Cook, in Philadelphia, where cookbook authors collaborate with local chefs to stage a meal built around the authors' latest books. For five years I collaborated with Chef Philippe Chin at his popular restaurants, Chanterelles and Philippe on Locust, where I was able to test out my new bread concepts on sophisticated foodies. At the year 2000 event, we featured wild mushroom ciabatta _(ciabatta al funghi),_ made according to the Gosselin _pain à l'ancienne_ method. We also introduced _pane siciliano,_ a bread that one of my former students at the California Culinary Academy, Peter DiCroce, brought to my attention. He wanted to re-create his Sicilian American childhood memories of semolina bread, so we worked together applying the pre-ferment techniques I was teaching to come up with the best version possible. After months of tinkering with it, we finally nailed down the formula and now make what I think is the finest version of this bread. The key is using lots of pre-fermented dough plus the addition of an overnight rise. The semolina flour gives the bread a sweet and nutty flavor that is unique and delightful.

In preparation for these forays to Philadelphia to try out my latest ideas, I corresponded about the Gosselin technique with many of my own mentors and influences. These include Jeffrey Steingarten, food columnist at _Vogue_ and author of _The Man Who Ate Everything,_ and Ed Behr, the publisher and author of _The Art of Eating,_ one of the more popular food journals. They had both visited Gosselin, were familiar with his bread, and were impressed with its quality and distinctiveness. Although they both write about all aspects of food, they seem to share a particular passion for good bread. A whole network of bread fanatics exists out there, on the Internet, in the newsletters, and in the pages of _Vogue_ and other mainstream journals. Behr and Steingarten are two of the more articulate spokespersons for the bread revolution, yet when it came to the Gosselin method, we all came away with different impressions of it. (Was he just messing with us, giving us partial versions, or did we each change it in our minds?) I know my interpretation is now quite different from even Gosselin's; like any bread baker worth his Normandy salt, I've tinkered and tweaked. I discovered that the true Gosselin method, which requires two mixings, may be consolidated into one mixing without adverse results. I began playing with variations and applications and now think of the _pain à l'ancienne_ technique in its generic, deconstructed sense as a delayed-fermentation cold-mixing method.

This technique has the potential to change the entire bread landscape in America. I've begun teaching it to my students, both at Johnson & Wales University and across the country in my classes for home bakers. Within the next few years I fully expect to see variations of this method appearing in both artisan bakeshops and at the industry level. It is the next frontier in breads. When we deconstruct the process, it takes us beyond fermentation, actually beneath fermentation, down to the level of enzymes. It is the enzyme that serves as the catalytic converter, freeing up the sugars that are bound up in the complex starches of flour. The delayed-fermentation technique, revealed to me by Gosselin, and intuited by many others without knowing why, is all about how enzymes affect fermentation and release flavor. At culinary schools we teach a fundamental principle: Flavor rules. But to release flavors, remember enzymes.

The Summer Loaf Festival 2000 took place just after I wrote the above words. I again taught a class and spoke at the Speaker's Corner, and I talked about cold fermentation and enzymes. Thousands of bread revolutionaries attended, hungry for baking tips and tricks, or just hungry, as food writer John Thorne says, for bread that is good beyond belief. We know that bread is a metaphor, we sense it in our bones, we eat it as the body of God in our worships, we believe that it truly is the staff of life.

It has been six thousand years since some Egyptian applied heat to beer and initiated the concept of leavened bread. The process clearly has its traditional and its neotraditional aspects. To make great bread we have learned from the patriarchs of the bread world the time-honored methods of the Old World. But they did not have refrigerators back then; they did not have access to ice chips and water coolers. We are writing new chapters, diving and deconstructing, and nibbling at the finer points, the microbial points, of the process.

What is it about bread that makes it such a hot topic these days? Whether master baker or young upstart, we are all apprentices, still learning and excited about sharing our findings with one another as we break into new bread frontiers. Even after six thousand years, we are all on a quest with no end in sight, trying to figure out how to make bread even better.

#  _Part II:  
Deconstructing Bread: A Tutorial_

## ASSUMPTIONS AND RATIONALES

Several assumptions and choices are fundamental to the way I bake bread. The assumptions represent ideas that will recur throughout the book and, rather than repeat them over and over in each formula, I am grouping them here for easy reference.

I begin with a discussion of ingredients, then move on to equipment, and conclude with an overview of basic bread classifications and the baker's math system (much easier than it sounds, I promise!).

## _Explanation of Weight and Measure Conversions_

I've noticed that various cookbooks list contradictory information regarding the weight of various ingredients. Every formula in this book lists both the volume measure (cups, teaspoons, and tablespoons) and weight. Obviously, a cup of flour does not weigh the same as a cup of water, or of salt, or of yeast. In fact, 1 cup of flour scooped by one person may not weigh the same as 1 cup scooped by another. That is why professional bakers prefer to use weights, since 1 pound of flour, regardless of how many scoops or cups it took to get there, will weigh the same 1 pound from person to person. Many home bakers are now baking by weight rather than measure, but as home bakers we face another problem not faced by professional bakeries. The size of our batches is much smaller, and some ingredients are so light that our kitchen scales cannot weigh them accurately, such as .11 ounce, a common weight. So, to make sure we're all on the same page, at left is a chart of the weights and measures that I've used in these formulas. If you are following formulas from another baking book, some of which might list 1 pound of flour as 4 or 4½ cups instead of the 3½ cups I use, remember that the weight is always the preferred amount, not the volume. You might want to weigh out 1 pound of flour yourself and see exactly how many cups of flour it takes when you do the scooping. Otherwise, these formulas do work with the weights given and, especially in the small-quantity items like salt, sugar, and yeast, with the volume measures as well.

Salt is always a tricky ingredient because various brands and types weigh out differently. Some salt is coarser than other salt or, as in kosher salt, the crystals are hollow and very light. For the purposes of this book, I have used table salt as the benchmark because everyone has it on hand. However, if you prefer to bake with sea salt or kosher salt, remember that the weight will remain the same, but the spoon equivalent will differ. My table salt, and I believe yours, requires 4 teaspoons to the ounce, or .25 ounce per teaspoon. This is what I used in the formulas. If you happen to use kosher salt, it will take nearly, but not quite, double that in volume, or 1¾ teaspoons, to make .25 ounce. Sea salt is somewhere in the middle, about 1½ teaspoons per .25 ounce. Rather than list every variable in each formula, I refer you back to this chart if you need to make a substitution.

Most of us know that a liquid ounce of water also equals a volume ounce. That is, 8 ounces of water by weight equals 1 cup. Liquid oil and milk, while not exactly the same weight as water, are close enough to follow the same weight-volume conversion as water.

You will also notice that coarse flour takes more volume to equal a pound than finely milled flour. This is because the coarser particles make the flour less dense and, as we all know, air is lighter than most ingredients. Again, some brands of flour may weigh out slightly differently than other brands per cup, so when in doubt, weigh it out. The baker's percentage system is always based on weight, not volume, so this is where the accuracy is to be found.

## _Types of Flour_

Flour is the core of bread, the body containing its heart and spirit. Wheat is the grain of choice, from which bread flour is milled. This is because wheat contains more gluten, a type of protein, than other grains. There are many international breads made from grains other than wheat, and there are many grains that can be added to wheat breads to make them interesting and nutritious. But the breads in this book are, for the most part, totally dependent on flour milled from wheat, regardless of the brand or the milling method.

Milling crushes wheat berries, which are the seeds or grains of mature wheat grass, into various degrees of powder. The three main components of a wheat berry are the outer skin, called bran; the oily, vitamin E–rich embryo, or germ; and the starch- and protein-laden nutritional cushion, called the endosperm. An analogy to this is an egg, with its shell, yolk, and white.

Flour, whether whole wheat or sifted into clear (once sifted) or patent (twice sifted) bleached or unbleached white flours, is called the "100 percent ingredient," against which all other ingredients stand in ratio. In the United States, one of the ways wheat flour is designated is by the amount of gluten protein (derived from the endosperm) it contains. Thus, cake flour has 6 to 7 percent gluten, pastry flour has 7.5 to 9.5 percent gluten, all-purpose flour has 9.5 to 11.5 percent gluten, bread flour has 11.5 to 13.5 percent gluten, and high-gluten flour has 13.5 to (rare but possible) 16 percent gluten. The gluten amount is determined by the type of wheat used in the flour. There is hard wheat and soft wheat, red wheat and white wheat, winter wheat and spring wheat. These various strains all contain different qualities or specifications (bakers refer to these qualities as specs), and the job of the mill is to blend various strains of wheat into flours suitable for the bakers' requirements.

European flours use other keys to define the type of flour, often assigning numbers that refer to ash content (related to fiber) or extensibility. For example, the French #55 flour is their standard baguette flour. It has moderate ash and is very extensible (as opposed to elastic and springy; see on Extensibility, Elasticity, and Tolerance). Some French breads now use #65 flour, which is higher in ash and thus has a more earthy, wheatlike coloration, similar to what American bakers call clear flour.

Professional bakers use the designations clear flour and patent flour for types of white flour (as opposed to whole-wheat flour, a category unto itself in which the entire wheat berry is preserved in the flour). They indicate what part of the wheat berry has been sifted through and packaged. Clear flour, which means the flour that clears the first sifting (to separate out the bran and germ), still retains some of the finer bran fiber from the outer endosperm of the wheat berry and is thus coarser and contains higher levels of ash. This flour is often used in rye breads and is usually made from very strong, high-protein wheat. Rarely is clear flour sold in regular markets, but it is a good value for professional bakers who can use it in whole-grain and high-fiber breads.

Patent flour, sometimes called "second clear," is flour that has passed through a second sifting, thus retaining only the pure inner endosperm, or white interior, of the wheat berry. It is the purest grade and shows up in stores as bleached or unbleached all-purpose, pastry, bread, or high-gluten flour.

Picking the right flour is one of the joys and challenges that bakers face, and sometimes it is what distinguishes one bakery's products from another's. Artisan bakers are as passionate about their choice of flour as they are about their formulas, and many professional bakeries are now contracting with small specialty farmers to grow specific types of wheat, hoping to match the specifications and functionality of European flour. This is one of the most exciting aspects of the bread movement, but one that has yet to trickle down to home bakers other than through a favorite local mill, a specialty packager like King Arthur, or a miller like Bob's Red Mill in Oregon. Flour availability will no doubt increase as demand grows; in the meantime, if you have a local bakery that makes a bread you really love, ask them the name of their flour and see if you can buy some from them.

Though home bakers have a more limited menu of flours from which to choose, as long as you use the type of flour called for, your breads will not suffer. The formulas in this book will work with any brand of commercially available bread flour and even, in most instances, with all-purpose flour. The performance of the formula may vary from brand to brand, and the dough will certainly absorb water differently depending on the flour. As a general rule, a higher percentage of protein (gluten) in flour translates to more water absorption and slightly longer mixing times. But since each brand of flour has slightly different specifications, including ash content, protein percentage, and the particular blend of wheat strains, we are left again with that important _feel_ quality. I find that King Arthur's unbleached all-purpose flour is comparable, for instance, to Gold Medal's bread flour (marketed as Better for Bread Flour).

_It is easy to see the subtle difference in color and texture of various flours when they are placed side by side. These are, from left to right, cornmeal, semolina flour (coarse durum), fancy durum, dark rye, white rye, bleached cake flour, unbleached pastry flour, unbleached bread flour, clear flour, and whole-wheat flour._

#### WHY USE UNBLEACHED FLOUR

Although it is possible to make good bread with bleached flour, it is preferable to use unbleached. This is because the yellowish tint in unbleached flour is caused by beta-carotene, the same substance we associate with vitamin A. While the nutritional value is compromised during the baking process, the real reason we prefer the presence of beta-carotene is that it contributes better aroma and better flavor to the bread (it also lends a visually appealing, creamy tint to the crumb, which is far more appetizing than pure white). This subtle difference can be discerned clearly if we taste and smell bread made from bleached versus unbleached flour side by side. In our efforts to evoke the fullest potential of flavor from the wheat, it is important to utilize every tool at our disposal. Flour, being the 100 percent ingredient in our baker's math system, is a major player in our ability to control outcomes.

The use of unbleached flour is especially important in simple lean breads, the _pains ordinaire,_ such as baguettes, and other French, Italian, and Vienna-style breads where the entire flavor is determined by the quality of the wheat, coupled with the baker's ability to draw out flavor through fermentation and baking technique. In highly enriched breads, such as pullman, challah, and general sandwich and soft dinner roll breads, the advantage of unbleached flour is nullified somewhat by such enrichments as fat, egg, and milk. However, if you only have bleached flour on hand and want to make baguettes or other lean breads, by all means go ahead. When in doubt follow what I consider the golden rule of all home-baked bread: it will always be a hit no matter how it turns out.

The formulas specify unbleached flour for the reasons specified above and, for the most part, almost all bread flour is unbleached (some brands are still bleached, so read the label to be sure). All-purpose flour may come in either bleached or unbleached forms. High-gluten flour, with its protein level of about 14 percent, is hard to find in supermarkets, but it can often be purchased at natural foods markets and through specialty sources. It does make a difference in some breads to use this stronger flour, but feel free to use bread flour in its place if you cannot find a source. (Do not underestimate the power of begging at your favorite bakery for a dip into their bin.)

#### WHOLE-WHEAT FLOUR

Whole-wheat flour, which still contains the oily wheat-germ nucleus, is always best if less than a few months old, but it does last for many months if kept at normal room temperature. During warm spells you might want to consider keeping it tightly sealed in your refrigerator or freezer. The type of grind—regular, medium, or coarse—may be specified in some formulas. If not, use regular grind or a blend of regular and either medium or coarse if you want more texture.

## _Why Instant Yeast_

The reasons I prefer instant yeast are simple: It's more concentrated than fresh or active dry yeast, it has a longer shelf life, and it can be added to the flour instead of hydrating it first. I believe in the old baker's axiom to use only as much yeast as it takes to get the job done and no more. Instant yeast is concentrated because of the method by which it is produced and packaged. There are 25 percent more living yeast cells per teaspoon than in an equal amount of active dry yeast, and there are three times (300 percent) more living cells than in an equal amount of fresh compressed yeast. Instant yeast, even though it may be called rapid-rise or fast-rising yeast on some packaging, is actually a potent, but slow to awaken, yeast, which I find to be an advantage in many instances (slower is better, as you will see). When the yeast does awaken, the cells do their work as any other type of yeast would, digesting sugar and creating carbon dioxide and ethanol as by-products. It is the number of viable cells, along with the temperature and dough environment (yeast needs three things to grow: food, warmth, and moisture), that determines the rate of fermentation. Instant yeast is the easiest to use, is now readily available, and requires the least amount of volume per formula (usually about .66 percent of the flour weight, as opposed to 2 percent for fresh compressed yeast).

Instant yeast, as well as active dry yeast, can be kept for months in the refrigerator in an airtight container without losing potency. Fresh yeast, on the other hand, because of its high moisture content, will degrade after about 2 weeks and will be completely over the hill within 4 weeks. The formulas specify instant yeast, but, as you will see, any type of yeast can be substituted. Regardless of the type of yeast you use, always keep it in an airtight container or wrapped completely in plastic wrap.

## _Water_

There is little advantage to using expensive bottled water if your regular tap water is drinkable. Any chlorine taste will bake out of the finished bread. Only if your water is particularly hard or soft should you consider using bottled water. As a general rule, I suggest everyone consider putting a filter on their tap since drinking water as a whole has declined in quality and is vulnerable to contamination. Even then, however, the baking process itself will kill any microorganisms.

For the record, I do not believe, as many New Yorkers do, that their bagels are better because of the water. New York City water does happen to be very good, but that is not what makes their bagels better. In fact, I believe that if you make the bagels in this book, you will come to agree with me on this point.

## _Hand Kneading, Electric Mixers, Bread Machines, and Food Processors_

The mixing instructions for most of the formulas in this book call for either hand mixing (kneading), using an electric mixer, or both. As you will see in the section on mixing, the method you use is less important than the final result, so I will leave this choice to you.

I almost always mix by hand because I love working the dough. Since one of the goals of this book is help you develop that elusive quality called feel, I recommend mixing by hand whenever possible. Many people are intimidated by kneading dough, which means they miss out on one of bread making's most valuable pleasures. The mixing time is nearly the same whether mixing by hand or machine, depending on how steady your pace is (well, maybe it takes a minute or two longer by hand).

Many people now own a KitchenAid or other brand of standing mixer with dough hook and paddle attachments. Most, but not all, of the formulas will fit in a standard-sized KitchenAid. In the case of those that don't, instructions are given for hand mixing or for using a larger machine, such as a Magic Mill.

I am definitely not against bread machines. In fact, I love them. But when you use a bread machine, you are limited to single-loaf recipes, so feel free to reduce larger formulas to fit your machine. Typically, a 1-pound machine will take dough with about 2 cups of flour, while a 1½-pound machine usually incorporates about 3 cups of flour. Many people now use their bread machine to mix and ferment the dough and then they perform the dividing and shaping by hand and the baking in a conventional oven. This is a great use for bread machines, as it allows you to form the loaf in the shape of your choice.

Many home bakers have discovered that most bread dough can be made in a food processor with good results. See How to Mix in a Food Processor for general guidelines for using a processor for mixing. When a dough works particularly well in a processor, I indicate this in the notes accompanying the formula.

## _Thermometer_

I highly recommend that you use an instant-read food thermometer (sometimes called a probe thermometer), any brand, when baking. You will need it for checking the temperatures of your ingredients, of the dough, and of the baked loaves. Every formula in the book refers to temperatures, and even though you will eventually be able to estimate temperatures by feel, it is important to develop that skill by discovering how particular temperatures, as registered on the thermometer, actually feel to the touch. Make sure the thermometer is calibrated accurately, or follow the directions on the package to calibrate it before using.

## _Shaping and ProofingEquipment_

Once I took a class on a field trip to Craig Ponsford's marvelous Artisan Bakers in Sonoma, shortly after Craig had won the world championship of bread in Paris at the 1995 Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie. One of my students noticed that the bakery only had a few dozen French _bannetons,_ the bentwood willow baskets so popular for shaping breads during the proofing stage. The bakery did have, however, hundreds of little wicker baskets, the type often used in restaurants for serving rolls or crackers. The student asked Craig why he proofed his dough in those baskets instead of the real _bannetons._ He answered by holding up one in each hand. "These," he said, nodding toward the French _banneton,_ "cost about fourteen dollars each wholesale and probably thirty dollars retail. These, on the other hand," as he looked toward the wicker, "cost me one dollar apiece at Cost Plus. They both do the job; you do the math."

_Wicker, muslin-lined bannetons._

Admittedly, the bentwood baskets are much sturdier than wicker and, frankly, feel good just to handle. But they are costly and, as with almost any other aspect of bread making, the professional tool can be improvised at home for far less money.

If you don't have professional _bannetons,_ you can improvise with stainless-steel or glass mixing bowls. The size of the bowl will depend on the size of the loaf, but since most of our formulas specify 1- or 1½-pound loaves, the bowls need not be big. However, a bowl does need to be twice as large as the piece of dough going into it to accomodate the rise.

_These_ boules _from Seven Stars (below) are proofed in_ bannetons _(above) that leave a distinctive pattern on the top of the loaf._

**IMPROVISED PROOFING BOWLS**

Mist a stainless-steel or glass mixing bowl with spray oil and then line with a cloth napkin, scrap fabric, or smooth towel (not terry cloth). Mist the fabric with spray oil and lightly dust with flour.

Place the loaf in the bowl, seam side up, and mist the top of the dough with spray oil.

Cover with the flaps of the fabric or a separate cloth.

When you are ready to bake the loaf, gently invert the bowl onto a peel or back of a sheet pan that has been dusted with semolina flour or cornmeal. Carefully peel off the fabric and proceed with scoring and baking.

_Fumie prepares a_ couche _to proof a batch of rustic dough._

The same improvisation can be used for _couches,_ the linen proofing cloths used in many bakeries for freestanding loaves. If you do not want to buy the actual heavy-duty layers (which is what _couche_ means) from the Baker's Catalogue (see Resources) or a bakery supply house, you can use a white tablecloth, preferably one that you no longer use for company. To ensure against sticking, lightly mist the surface with spray oil and dust the cloth with flour before lining up your loaves. Once the loaves are on the cloth, bunch the cloth between the pieces to make a wall and cover with cloth or plastic wrap.

The cloth is helpful with soft dough because it provides walls and structure to prevent the dough from spreading sideways or flattening. But much of the dough usually raised on cloth will do perfectly fine on a sheet pan that has been lined with baking parchment, misted with spray oil, dusted with cornmeal or semolina flour, and loosely covered with plastic wrap or slipped into a food-grade plastic bag. Food-grade plastic bags are usually clear or translucent and are designed to store food without leaching any petrochemicals into it. The shiny, vinyllike trash bags are not food grade, though many people use them for this purpose.

With just a few basic tools, spray oil being one of them, you can pretty much replicate at little expense many of the processes used in bakeries. Or, you can go whole hog and outfit your kitchen with the authentic tools, most which are now available for home chefs. As Craig Ponsford puts it, "You do the math."

## _Baking Parchment and Silpats_

Another baking tool that I use extensively and highly recommend is baking parchment. I do not, however, like the parchment that comes on a roll because it tends to curl up easily and is a hassle to cut. Instead, I prefer precut sheets, which are now becoming more readily available and certainly can be found at baking supply stores (or ask to buy a few dozen sheets from your favorite bakery). One sheet can be cut in half for home sheet pans (which are technically half sheet pans as far as professional kitchens are concerned).

Not everyone knows that baking parchment is silicon treated and that it does not perform like greased or waxed paper. The silicon does not cause a release until it heats up to about 160°F, so if you plan to move products around on the parchment, it is best first to mist the paper with spray oil. In many instances you will also dust the parchment with cornmeal or gritty semolina flour for both texture and release value. This is not always necessary and applies to only particular breads, but it does provide a nice bottom to hearth breads.

One of the best features of baking parchment is that you can slide it right into the oven, directly onto a baking stone. This makes it possible to transfer bread to the oven without having to lift it off the proofing pan, thus diminishing the possibility of damaging the dough while it is at its most vulnerable.

Many home bakers are now using silicon-treated rubber mats, sold under the brand name Silpat, and these are useful for some breads, especially if you plan to bake directly on the sheet pan. I never use them, however, for baking directly on a hot stone for fear of melting the silicon or wearing out the pad prematurely. The best thing about Silpats is that they are reusable.

## _Why Spray Oil Works Best_

Spraying a mist of oil over the dough prevents the dough from sticking to plastic wrap or other coverings before baking and, of course, releases the product from the baking pan once it is done. I use spray oil more than almost anyone I know, but it really makes life easier. It doesn't matter what brand you choose, although some are pure vegetable oil and others have food-grade pan-release additives. Always keep a can on the counter because every formula in this book requires it at some point. You can make your own by using vegetable or olive oil in a pressurized pump-style kitchen mister. The main advantage of spray oil is that you are able to use a minimum amount of oil to create the necessary release effect. If you do not have spray oil, lightly brush on liquid oil with either a paper towel or a pastry brush.

## _Baking Stones_

I highly recommend using a baking stone for many of the breads in this book. Stones retain heat much more effectively than sheet pans do, and thus promote a more even bake and a crispier crust. In tandem with the double-steaming technique, a stone is the home baker's best means of replicating the hearth ovens used by artisan bakers.

I prefer the thick, rectangular stones available now in most houseware departments or cooking stores. These stones retain their heat longer than thin, round pizza stones. The unglazed quarry tiles that many of us used before stones became so available are also good, though they tend to slide around and are more prone to cracking when they get wet. If you have already outfitted your oven with tiles and are happy with them, feel free to continue using them. The key to is get the stone (or tiles) as hot as possible before you transfer the dough to the oven, so be sure it is in place when you preheat the oven, and allow 45 minutes to get the stone as hot as the oven. I always heat to at least 50°F and sometimes 100°F higher than I actually need to to compensate for all the heat that will be lost during the steaming action and door opening. After I finish steaming, I reset the oven to the desired temperature.

Since every oven bakes differently, you will have to be the judge as to the best location for the stone. Some people prefer to put it on the floor of the oven, while others use one of the shelves. I usually place it on an oven rack in the lower third of my electric oven, which leaves headroom for tall loaves and delivers a pretty even baking performance.

If you want to make hearth breads but do not have a stone, you can invert a regular sheet pan and use it as a baking deck. Simply slide the pan into the oven on the regular oven rack and proceed with steaming.

## _Ovens_

No two ovens bake the same, so all baking times are approximate and based on conventional radiant-heat ovens. You almost always will need to rotate your breads 180 degrees about halfway through the estimated baking time for even baking. If you are using a wood-fired oven, all bets are off and you will know better than I how long to bake your breads. If you are using a convection oven, I recommend lowering the suggested temperature 25° to 50°F, depending on the intensity of the convection, and decreasing baking time by about 20 percent.

## _Fermentation and ProofingTemperatures_

As you begin making some of the breads in this book, you will notice that almost all of them are fermented and proofed at room temperature, not in a warm place. To artisan bakers, room temperature _is_ a warm place. Yeast will double its rate of fermentation for every 17°F increase in heat, up to the killing point (about 140°F). In most cases, slower is better. Bread that might rise in 1 hour in a commercial proof box at 90°F will take 2 hours if the room temperature is 73°F. But during that extra hour more flavor is being elicited from the flour by the organic activity that is going on invisibly inside the dough.

However, you do have the power to control the fermentation and may find for various reasons that you want to speed up the final rise (or slow it down), and you are free to do so if it meets your needs. See the advice for proof box improvisation in the home kitchen.

## _TheBaker's Math-Formula System_

Professional bakers view recipes as formulas, meaning that they conceive them as ratios and percentages rather than as cups and spoonfuls. Weight measuring is preferred because it is far more accurate than volume (or scoop) measuring, but even more importantly, the ratios of ingredients to one another reveal patterns that allow bakers to be creative and to control the outcomes of their efforts. Home bakers tend to avoid thinking mathematically (and my full-time students also try, unsuccessfully, to dodge this bullet), but I can assure you that possession of this knowledge will strengthen your ability to control the outcome of your baking. The baker's percentage formulas that accompany each recipe in this book are designed with just such a goal in mind. Each can be easily rescaled for larger batch sizes and adjusted within a given batch size to refine a recipe.

To understand the baker's math system, it is important to know that all ingredients are viewed in ratio to the total flour weight (TFW). The TFW always equals 100 percent, and all other ingredients are figured as a percentage against that figure. For example, if the flour weight is 1 pound (16 ounces) and the salt weight is ¼ ounce (.25 ounce), the percentage of salt to flour is determined by dividing the salt weight by the flour weight and multiplying by 100 (.25 ÷ 16 = .0156 × 100 = 1.56 percent). An experienced baker knows that salt is usually 1.5 to 2.5 percent of flour weight, so this ratio, 1.56 percent, indicates an appropriate amount of salt.

Water or other liquids also fall within norms in particular types of breads, such as 55 to 65 percent for French breads, sandwich bread, or rolls, and 65 to 80 percent for ciabatta and focaccia. For example, if a recipe for baguettes calls for 2 pounds of flour (TFW), the water should be approximately 60 percent. We can calculate this by multiplying 2 pounds by 60 percent (2 × .60 = 1.2). To convert this pound weight to ounces, simply multiply by 16 (since there are 16 ounces to the pound). So 16 × 1.2 = 19.2 ounces, or just slightly more than 19 ounces of water is needed. To check the accuracy, divide the 19.2 ounces of water by the 32 ounces (2 pounds) of flour. It will come to .60, or 60 percent.

Some other principles to keep in mind:

  * **Total Flour Weight (TFW)** consists of all the flour in the recipe, so if there is a combination of white and whole-grain flour, the total is 100 percent. Example: The recipe calls for 1 pound of bread flour and 4 ounces of rye flour. The total flour weight is 1 pound, 4 ounces (1.25 pounds), and this is the ratio to which all other ingredients relate. If there is a sponge (pre-ferment), it may weigh more than the total flour weight. For instance, some of the recipes call for 1 pound of flour and 1.66 pounds of _poolish_ (sponge). If you divide 1.66 pounds by 1 pound, you get 1.66, or 166 percent.
  * **The formula's Total Percentage (TP)** does not add up to 100 percent, only the flour weight does. Every formula will have a different TP depending on the number of ingredients. It will begin with 100 percent and go up from there.
  * **If a formula is given to you with only the percentages and not the weights,** it is possible to figure out the weight of each ingredient, as long as you know how much total dough you need.

For example, you need 10 pounds of bread (total weight, or TW) for a party, and the recipe is a classic French bread dough: 100 percent flour, 60 percent water, 2 percent salt, 2 percent fresh yeast. Therefore, the TP is 164 percent. Here is how you then figure each ingredient weight:

First, divide the TW by the TP (divide 10 pounds by 164 percent, or 1.64) to determine the TFW. This will give you a TFW of 6.097 pounds, or 6 pounds plus .097 × 16 = 1.55 ounces). To make things easy, and to give you some buffer, round the number up to an easy to work with figure, such as 6.25 pounds (6 pounds, 4 ounces), and use that as the TFW. (It is always better to round up and have too much dough rather than too little dough.)

Then, find the water weight by multiplying 6.25 pounds (TFW) × 60 percent = 3.75 pounds (3 pounds, 12 ounces).

Do the same with the yeast and salt (6.25 × 2 percent = .125 pound or .125 × 16 = 2 ounces).

The recipe will now read:  
6 pounds, 4 ounces flour  
3 pounds, 12 ounces water  
2 ounces salt  
2 ounces yeast

The column totals 10 pounds, 4 ounces. This is 4 ounces more than we need (the buffer), so that's good.

This system will come in handy as you become familiar with more breads based on the categories discussed in later in this chapter, especially if you want to control flavor or texture, or troubleshoot a performance problem. For instance, if your dinner rolls are too hard and the percentage of fat is only 6 percent, you might want to increase that to 10 percent by multiplying the TFW by 10 percent. Or, if the dough is rising too slowly and you discover the yeast is only at 2 percent, you may decide, if appropriate for the dough, to increase the yeast to 3 percent by doing the math. If the dough tastes salty and you discover, by doing the math, that the salt is 3 percent, you can confidently reduce the salt to 2 percent by doing the math. (Yeast percentage in professional bakeries, by the way, is usually based on fresh compressed yeast. If you are using instant yeast, as is the case throughout this book, plan to reduce the amount to one-third the amount of fresh yeast; if you are using active dry yeast, reduce the amount to half the amount of the fresh yeast. Also, if the formula calls for instant yeast and all you have is active dry, increase the amount of active dry by 25 percent more than the instant yeast.)

Initially, this formula system may seem confusing. It takes practice to get the hang of using the baker's percentage, but even a rudimentary understanding will strengthen your bread-baking skills. Just remember these primary baker's math formulas:

_TFW = TW ÷ TP_

(Total Flour Weight equals Total Weight divided by Total Percentage)

_IW = IP × TFW_

(Ingredient Weight equals Ingredient Percentage times Total Flour Weight)

_IP = IW ÷ TFW × 100_

(Ingredient Percentage equals Ingredient Weight divided by Total Flour Weight times 100)

To illustrate these concepts, let's look at a master formula as it might be presented in one of my classes (a variation on the format used in this book). This is for the standard white sandwich bread called _pain de mie_ in France and sometimes referred to in American bakeries as pullman bread. This recipe is for 10 pounds of dough. (Later in the book, we'll see this formula recalculated for use at home in a smaller mixer.)

A final reminder before we walk through this exercise: knowledge is power, the power to affect outcomes, in life and in baking, so I encourage you to dive into this process as one of empowerment as well as culinary enjoyment.

In a 20-quart mixer, mix all ingredients on low speed for 2 minutes. Then, mix on second speed for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the dough sets up and is approximately 80°F. Follow the twelve stages to complete.

Here are a few things that immediately become evident: The dough contains a ratio of 8 percent shortening (fat) to flour (notice that the weight of the flour represents 100 percent). This immediately tells us the dough falls in the enriched category, especially since it also contains milk (in powdered form), sugar, and eggs. The formula contains a ratio of 2 percent salt to flour, and 3 percent fresh yeast to flour. These ratios are right in line with this kind of bread, but the 3 percent yeast indicates a fast-moving dough (French bread, for instance, usually only contains 2 percent yeast to flour). Such dough offers no opportunity for extended punch downs or long fermentation cycles. This is meant to be a rather fast, easy-to-make bread whose flavor is determined more by the enrichments than by the fermentation. Being enriched, it is designed to be a soft bread, tender to chew. The eggs, milk, and sugar add various degrees of sweetness, fat, and protein to the bread. This means the dough will caramelize easily and thus should be baked at a lower temperature than, say, lean French bread _,_ which contains no added sugar or enrichments and will therefore brown, or caramelize, more slowly, and thus requires a hotter oven temperature.

The dough has a hydration ratio of 58 percent water to flour (plus a few extra percentage points for the liquid in the eggs—figure about 3 percent since eggs are about 75 percent water). This information clearly places pullman bread in the standard range rather than rustic or stiff. The dough should be pliable and tacky, but not sticky. It should be easy to handle, needing only a minimum amount of dusting flour.

During its primary fermentation it will probably double in size in 60 to 90 minutes, depending on the temperature at which it is held. Once it ferments, it will quickly be brought through the dividing, rounding, benching, and shaping stages so that it can undergo its final fermentation, or proofing, which should again take 60 to 90 minutes. It is then baked at approximately 350°F until it is done, meaning that the crust has caramelized, the proteins have coagulated and formed a distinctive gluten webbing, and the starch has gelatinized. The internal temperature of the bread should be 185° to 190°F when it comes from the oven, thus ensuring a full, but light, gelatinization and little or no deep protein roasting. This kind of bread is designed to be consumed with other condiments or foods, such as butter, jam, and/or sandwich fillings, offering little resistance to the tooth and providing sweetness more from the sugar than from the flour. (This is different from French bread in which all the sweetness is evoked from the natural wheat sugars.)

Please refer back to the pullman formula and look at the percentage column. Try to grasp the relationship of each ingredient to the flour weight. Notice that the way we determined the flour weight was by dividing the total weight of all the ingredients (10 pounds) by the total percentage of the formula (189 percent, or 1.89), and then rounding the answer to 5 pounds, 4 ounces.

#### NOTE ON BAKER'S PERCENTAGE FORMULAS

There are two ways a formula can be broken up into percentage ratios. The first, used in most of the recipes in this book, is to count only the flour in the final dough to represent the TFW as the 100 percent ingredient. With this approach we do not count the flour in a pre-ferment as part of the TFW. The second approach is to use the flour in both the pre-ferment _and_ the final dough as the TFW. Both are valid methods with advantages and disadvantages.

The primary advantage of the first method is that the pre-ferment is seen as a distinct ingredient in ratio to the flour in the final dough. This is helpful for breads made with a _poolish, biga, pâte fermentée,_ or wild-yeast (sourdough) pre-ferment, all of which can be made in any size and then measured off as needed. The disadvantage is that this approach does not represent each of the other ingredients as a ratio against the true amount of flour used. The flour in a _poolish,_ for example, is, in reality, part of the actual total flour weight but not part of the official 100 percent ingredient, the TFW, as listed in the final dough. In the ciabatta formula, for instance, the _biga_ (or _poolish,_ depending on which formula you follow) is a distinct ingredient, listed separately and in ratio to the TFW.

The main advantage of the second approach—including all the pre-ferment ingredients as part of the final dough—is that it allows us to see every ingredient in ratio to the full amount of flour. This approach makes more sense when using a fast-acting pre-ferment that has been calculated specifically for that formula, as with the recipes for bagels, brioche, _casatiello,_ and stollen. This fast-acting pre-ferment is generally called a sponge, and the final dough is made by building upon all of the sponge. Very often in dough made with a fast sponge, all of the yeast and much of the hydrating liquid is introduced during the sponge stage with only part of the total flour. The disadvantage of this approach to calculation is that some ingredients, such as flour and perhaps water or yeast, get split and listed more than once in the percentage formula, which can be confusing.

## _Classifications of Breads_

There are many ways to frame the classifications of bread, as you will see on the chart. For instance, one classification system defines breads according to three categories based on hydration, or water content. These are the _stiff doughs_ (bagels, pretzels—50 to 57 percent hydration of liquid to flour), _standard doughs_ (sandwich bread, rolls, French and other European-style breads—57 to 65 percent hydration), and _rustic doughs_ (ciabatta, pizza, focaccia—above 65 percent hydration). All breads will fall into one of these categories.

Another classification system defines breads by hardness or richness. _Lean dough_ (from which French, Italian, sourdough hearth, and bagels are made) has little or no fat or added enrichments. _Enriched dough_ has some fat, dairy, eggs, or sugar—enough to tenderize and add a little sweetness or flavor. This category includes most sandwich breads, soft rolls, and braided breads such as challah. _Rich dough_ includes breads with more than 20 percent fat to flour ratio, such as brioche, some holiday breads, croissants, and Danish pastry. Within this category of breads is a subcategory called _laminated bread._ This term refers to croissants, Danish, puff pastry, and even some types of biscuit and pie dough. They all have a high percentage of fat that is laminated between layers of dough using a series of folds. The dough puffs when it is baked, resulting in a flaky texture.

A large classification called _flat breads_ includes both yeasted and unyeasted doughs whose primary attribute is low height. This family embraces, but is not limited to, pizza and focaccia, crackers, matzo, lavash, and tortillas. These breads may be crisp, airy, soft, flaky, or tender, depending on the style. The dough can be lean, enriched, or rich.

Another classification is composed of breads made with no pre-ferment and in one mixing cycle. These are called _direct_ or _straight doughs._ The counterpoint are breads made with a pre-ferment, which are known as _indirect_ or _sponge breads._

Finally, there are the classifications of _commercially yeasted breads, naturally leavened breads_ (wild yeast or sourdough), and _unyeasted doughs_ that may or may not be chemically leavened by baking soda or baking powder. The latter includes quick breads, a subcategory of its own with tortillas, biscuits, muffins, and pie doughs.

As we encounter specific breads in this book, it will be necessary at times to refer to them within their categories in order to make certain points about the process. Armed with this information, including knowledge of the baker's math system, it will be possible for you, whether home bakers or professionals, to confidently create numerous original recipes with infinite variations.

## **_Breads by Category_**

The following charts list the breads in this book by the categories in which they fall. Since every bread falls within more than one category, depending on the method of classification, it's helpful to see all the profiles together. Similarities and differences among breads emerge, and the patterns will help you better understand and control the baking process. The first set of charts lists each category and the breads which fall in them, and the second set of charts lists each type of bread and the categories under which it falls.

## THE TWELVE STAGES OF BREAD:  
Evoking the Fullness of Flavor From the Grain

In my first lecture, on the first day of the twenty-two-day bread lab that I teach at Johnson & Wales University, I tell my students, "Your mission as a bread baker is to evoke the fullness of flavor from the wheat." Everything else we do flows from this statement. Some of the students grasp this concept at the beginning and some grasp it by the end of the course (and a few, regrettably, never quite get it, though in those instances I consider it a seed planted for future harvest). Most important, though, is that this goal provides the focal point through which everything I teach makes sense. Deconstructing bread making can be a tedious process if we don't have a compelling reason to do so. Fortunately, what I've discovered in my travels across the country teaching home bakers, and also my full-time students, is that there is an amazingly strong interest in this mission.

This section will summarize all twelve stages of bread production, with a brief overview of how to build a loaf in order to accomplish the baker's mission. Ultimately, this is done by unwinding the complex carbohydrates to release their foundational sugars through mastery of fermentation, and by roasting the proteins to draw forth their nutlike flavors, while fully gelatinizing the starches so that they do not mask any of the flavor. To understand how to do this, we will review the basic principles underlying world-class bread, including the use of sponges, pre-ferments, starters, oven technique, and wild versus commercial yeast. Much of this has been previously presented in _Crust & Crumb: Master Formulas for Serious Bread Bakers,_ as well as in books by other authors. However, I want to take these techniques further than in previous books, so we will metaphorically follow the bread baker's axiom that the best loaves are made by building dough in stages. To this end, we will layer new knowledge upon foundational principles and then extend this knowledge into frontier territory.

In the table below you will see the twelve stages of bread. All bread goes through these stages, which form the framework of the bread-baking process. Understanding this structure does not ensure great bread; neither does failure to understand this structure mean you will not make great bread. Most commercial bread bakers, many who have had no formal training, do not have the slightest clue about these twelve stages, but they do know that if they explicitly follow directions they can produce adequate bread. However, in our quest to control outcomes and have the power to push beyond adequacy to world-class quality, understanding this structure as the foundation of bread baking is the first layer of knowledge. In the pages to come, we will build on this foundation into more advanced concepts.

All bread goes through twelve stages in its journey from raw ingredients to consumable loaf. In some instances, such as sandwich breads, certain of these stages happen almost simultaneously, while in other instances, bagels for example, there are slight variations in how the dough journeys through the stages. What is universal, though, is that some form of transformation occurs, changing a lifeless lump of flour-based clay into a living, growing organism. What was once a tasteless pile of flour, like sawdust on the tongue, is miraculously transformed into a multilayered series of flavors and textures that bring joy to both the palate and the soul. How does this happen? Is it chemistry or alchemy?

Eighty percent of the quality of the finished bread will be determined during the primary fermentation stage (Stage Three), and the other 20 percent primarily will be determined during the baking, or oven, stage (Stage Ten). Some of the in-between stages affect the outcome in subtle and important ways, but they cannot undo choices made during the fermentation and baking stages. But even these vital stages are totally dependent on the first stage, _mise en place,_ and the success of your personal bread-baking experience, not just the finished product, begins with organization. If you get off to a good start, the rest will take care of itself.

**_For perspective, here are the twelve stages in order:_**

**1. Mise en place** ("everything in its place" is the organizing principle)

**2. Mixing** (in which three important requirements must be met)

**3. Primary fermentation** (also called bulk fermentation, in which most of the flavor is determined)

**4. Punching down** (also called de-gassing, in which the dough begins to enter its secondary fermentation and individuation)

**5. Dividing** (in which pieces are weighed or scaled, while continuing to ferment)

**6. Rounding** (in which the pieces are given an interim shaping prior to their final shape)

**7. Benching** (also called resting, or intermediate proofing, during which time the gluten relaxes)

**8. Shaping and panning** (in which the dough is given its final shape prior to baking)

**9. Proofing** (also called secondary or final fermentation, in which the dough is leavened to its appropriate baking size)

**10. Baking** (which may also include scoring the dough and steaming, but in which three vital oven actions must occur)

**11. Cooling** (which is really an extension of baking but must occur before cutting into the bread)

**12. Storing and eating** (in production baking it's primarily storing, but home baking usually emphasizes, ahem, eating)

## _Stage 1: Mise en Place_

We begin our exploration of this transformational process with _mise en place,_ both as a stage of bread baking and as a principle of life and knowledge. _Mise en place_ is the primary organizational principle in all cooking. It means first things first or, literally, "everything in its place." It is the first stage in the transformational journey of how flour becomes bread.

The baker's "altar of transformation" requires only a few essentials: properly measured or weighed ingredients, a sturdy work bench, mixing tools consisting of either bowls or machines, a decent oven, and room to perform the various activities through which the dough will traverse its twelve stages. There are, of course, refinements to this list that include additional tools, such as thermometers, baking stones, water misters, and the like.

**MISE EN PLACE CHECKLIST**

I have divided this checklist into "must have" and "ought to have," and by that I mean that many tools can be improvised, but there are some, at least for the formulas in this book, that really need to be part of your setup. Spray oil and baking parchment are good examples. Here's one organizational tip: never start making bread without first setting up a bowl of extra flour for dusting and adjustments. Also, have a plastic bowl scraper and a metal dough scraper (sometimes called a bencher or pastry blade) in place, and keep a bowl of water available both for adjustments and for dipping hands or tools in to keep dough from sticking. If you don't have any of these in place before you start mixing the dough you will soon know, when you go to reach for something or, later, when you are cleaning bread dough off everything, why you need them in place ahead of time.

**MUST HAVE**

  * Measuring tools
  * Spray oil, any brand or homemade
  * Baking parchment
  * Plastic bowl scraper
  * Metal pastry scraper (aka bencher, dough scraper)
  * Rubber spatula
  * Various-sized mixing bowls
  * Wooden and metal mixing spoons
  * Sturdy work counter
  * Extra flour
  * Extra water
  * Instant-read (probe) thermo-meter
  * All of the ingredients for the formula weighed or measured in advance
  * Sheet pans that fit your oven
  * Bread pans in two sizes: 8½ by 4½ inch (for 1-pound loaves) and 9 by 5 inch (for 1½- and 2-pound loaves)

**OUGHT TO HAVE**

  * Electric mixer or food processor
  * Sharp serrated knife, French _lame_ (scoring blade), or razor
  * Pizza cutter (rolling blade)
  * Cornmeal or semolina for dusting
  * Proofing _couche_ or cloth substitute
  * Proofing baskets _(bannetons)_ or bowl substitutes
  * Kitchen scale, accurate to at least .25 ounce
  * Steaming devices
  * Cooling racks
  * Plastic wrap or food-grade plastic bags
  * Baking stone or quarry tiles
  * Wooden or metal peel

#### KEYS TO MISE EN PLACE

Here are keys to Stage One of bread making, _mise en place:_

  * **Refer to the _mise en place_ checklist above,** making sure in advance that you have everything you need.
  * **Read the instructions from start to finish and visualize** how you plan to make the formula at each stage. Many times this mental preparation will reveal a missing tool or time conflict (such as, what about the roast that will be in the oven when I need to bake the bread!).
  * **Decide whether you are going to weigh or scoop** your ingredients. There are many inexpensive electric scales available that are accurate to within .25 ounce or 5 grams (there are approximately 28 grams to the ounce). If you are scooping, refer to the chart of weights and measures for common ingredients, but remember that everyone has a different touch when it comes to scoops. Many of my friends claim that it takes 4 cups of flour to make a pound, while I always end up with 3½ cups to the pound. The difference means that for me 1 cup of flour weighs just over 4.5 ounces, while my friend's cup of flour weighs only 4 ounces. The flour amount will take care of itself during the mixing stage as you make adjustments based on the feel of the dough. But salt and yeast are more difficult to adjust. There is a great difference between a rounded and a level teaspoon (or tablespoon). Remember that a bread recipe, that is, the measurements for a specific batch as opposed to a formula (which consists of percentages rather than weights and measures), is strictly a guideline, not an absolute. The brand or age of your flour may make it necessary to adjust the flour or liquid even when you have scaled ingredients precisely. But by starting with accurate measurements your adjustments will be minimal and your margin for error will be reduced.
  * **_Mise en place_ is as much a mental organization** as it is about scaling ingredients. Arrange to have as few distractions as possible, or factor them in as required. Minimize conversation, or you will surely make mistakes or forget an ingredient. Success in bread making, as in any facet of life, comes down to one word: focus.
  * **Scale (weigh or scoop) all your ingredients** before starting to assemble the dough.

## _Stage 2:Mixing_

Mixing is sometimes referred to as kneading, especially if it is performed by hand rather than in a machine. Regardless of the name given to it, mixing has three purposes: distributing the ingredients, developing the gluten, and initiating fermentation. Of course, how the three goals of mixing are achieved depends greatly on the raw materials that go into the thing that is being mixed—the dough. So, let's first look at the two distinct categories of doughs: direct doughs and indirect doughs.

#### DIRECT DOUGH VERSUS INDIRECT DOUGH

Direct dough is mixed with ingredients that have not undergone any previous mixing or fermentation. Breads made with direct dough usually rely more on the flavor of the ingredients than on flavor developed through fermentation, and the recipes often have enough yeast to bring about the necessary leavening in a minimal amount of time. Examples of typical direct-dough breads include standard enriched white bread, flavored dough like cheese bread or spiced bread, and most (but not all) sandwich bread and soft rolls.

Indirect dough is built in two or more stages, utilizing one of many types of pre-fermented dough. There are some breads that greatly benefit from this building approach, while others may show no discernible improvement beyond the direct-dough method. The indirect method is particularly effective when extended fermentation is necessary for flavor or texture development, such as in lean _pain ordinaire._ Breads such as French bread, whole-grain (especially 100 percent whole-wheat) bread, and rye bread usually turn out better if made with a pre-ferment because the extended fermentation makes the bread more digestible and coaxes more flavor from the grain.

**Pre-ferments**

A pre-ferment is a powerful tool in the creation of superior bread. Pre-ferments extend fermentation time, allowing for more flavor to be teased out of the complex wheat molecule. Four types of pre-fermented dough are commonly used, with variations of each creating the possibility of endless types of pre-ferments. There are two types of firm, or dry, pre-ferments and two types of wet, or sponge, pre-ferments. The firm pre-ferments are known under their European names, _pâte fermentée_ and _biga._ The wet pre-ferments are called _poolish_ and regular sponge, or _levain levure_ (leaven of the yeast) in French.

_A_ Poolish _(right) is very wet and sticky, while a_ biga _(left) look and feels like French bread dough_

_Pâte fermentée_ is the French name for pre-fermented, or old, dough. It can be made, for example, by saving a piece of dough from one batch, after the dough has had its primary fermentation, to use later in a different batch, or by simply making a piece of dough specifically to be used later, perhaps the next day. Adding the _pâte fermentée_ has the effect of immediately aging a newly made dough. This method is often used in bakeries to improve simple lean breads.

_Biga_ , an Italian style of firm pre-ferment, differs from _pâte fermentée_ in that it doesn't have any salt in it. Also, rather than cutting off a piece of finished bread dough to hold back as an improver, a _biga_ is made specifically to be used as a pre-ferment. By leaving out the salt, a _biga_ can be made with less yeast than a finished bread to accomplish its necessary fermentation. Salt serves as a yeast inhibitor, making fermentation more difficult to accomplish (which is why it makes such a good preservative in other foods). In the absence of salt, the yeast has no restrictions in its quest to digest all available sugar, so very little yeast is needed _._

Why is using less yeast good? Remember that our mission is to evoke from the wheat the fullness of its flavor. The flavor of bread comes from the grain, not from the yeast. Leaven should not draw attention to itself but to the grain. Therefore, a baker's maxim is to use only as much yeast as is necessary to get the job done. This minimizes the flavor of the yeast and maximizes the flavor of the grain. Thus a _biga_ may have as little as .5 percent fresh yeast to flour (and even less if using instant or active dry yeast) to ferment the dough successfully.

_Poolish_ is a term that was coined by the French to honor the Polish bakers who, centuries ago, taught them this technique for improving bread. _Poolish_ is a wet sponge, usually made with a ratio of equal weights water and flour, no salt, and only .25 percent fresh yeast to flour, even less than for a _biga._ The wet sponge offers far less resistance to fermentation than does firm dough, so the yeast has an easy time converting the available sugars into carbon dioxide and ethanol. For this reason, a little yeast goes a long way, and a long fermentation ensues. When a _poolish_ is used as a pre-ferment it is usually, but not always, necessary to add more yeast during the mixing of the final dough to complete the leavening.

A regular sponge, on the other hand, is usually faster than a _poolish_ because it front-loads all or most of the yeast in the sponge itself. This kind of sponge, often used in whole-grain and rich breads, improves flavor and digestibility of the grain, but in less time than a _poolish._ The flavor improvement is not as drastic as in the slower pre-ferments, but the trade-off is that the breads can be made in a relatively short time frame. The final mixing, for instance, can be done approximately 1 hour after the sponge is made.

_Soaker_ is the name for another type of pre-ferment that appears in some of the formulas. This is a nonyeasted ingredient, usually a coarsely milled whole grain such as cornmeal, rye meal, or cracked wheat, that has been soaked overnight in water or milk. Its purpose is to activate the enzymes in the grains in order to break out some of the trapped sugars from the starches. It also softens the coarse grain. While there is little or no actual fermentation taking place in a soaker, its effect in the final dough is dramatic. The instructions for these will be provided in the formulas in which they are used.

The real question behind these pre-ferment techniques, and one that you are hopefully asking at this point, is why does extended fermentation improve flavor? This is where deconstructing bread gets really interesting because you enter into the realm of enzymes, and the concept of sugar breakout, the real key to evoking flavor from the grain. We'll get deeper into the world of enzyme activity at Stage Three, primary fermentation.

Note: There is often confusion among bakers regarding the terminology surrounding pre-ferments. Some bakers refer to all pre-ferments as sponges, whether they are made with commercial yeast or wild yeast, whether they are firm and dry, or wet and sticky. Other bakers only use the term sponge for wet, fast-acting pre-ferments. Some breads are made with a fast-rising sponge ( _levain levure_ ), and other breads with a slow-acting sponge (the _poolish,_ for example). All pre-fermented dough can be called a sponge, however, or by any other of the international names that are associated with them. Regardless of how they are made or what they are called, they are all part of the family called pre-ferments, that is, dough that has been fermented in advance and added to another dough as part of a building process. For our purposes, when we refer to sponges, we mean wet pre-ferments, whether made with commercial yeast (like a _poolish_ ) or wild yeast (like a barm). Firm, dry pre-ferments will be referred to by name, such as _biga,_ or simply as firm starters (usually in sourdough bread). Whether called sourdough starter, _levain,_ barm, _desum,_ mother, or _chef,_ these are all variations of pre-ferments leavened by wild yeast rather than commercial yeast. This category of pre-ferments will be explained later in this chapter.

#### MACHINE MIXING VERSUS HAND KNEADING

Whether a dough is made using the direct or indirect method, the three purposes of mixing—distribution of ingredients, development of gluten, and initiation of fermentation—must be fulfilled. The "how" question reveals the philosophical divide that exists in the baking world between those who are die-hard by-hand kneaders and the opposing camp of mixing-machine loyalists. There is a certain romantic, spiritual cachet to the idea of hand kneading, and I wouldn't deny the meditative, spiritual component of the process. Looked at from a strictly utilitarian perspective, however, each method can get the job done.

In batches larger than 10 pounds, it is more practical to use large mixing machines, of which there are several designs, than to mix by hand (although I do know a few bakers who mix even large batches by hand). Small batches can be mixed in:

  * KitchenAid mixers (2 pounds of flour is usually the maximum).
  * Food processors (1 pound of flour is the maximum, unless you have a very large processor).
  * Magic Mill mixers (5 pounds of flour is the maximum).
  * Other electric mixers such as Kenwood and Rival, which are made by the same company (2 to 4 pounds of flour, depending on the model).
  * Any brand of electric bread machines to knead (1-pound to 2-pound loaves, depending on the model).

HOW TO MIX IN A FOOD PROCESSOR

Many bread bakers are now using food processors to mix dough and, if properly used, they work well. The key is to use the pulse mechanism and not to mix for long cycles. Also, because the processor mixes ingredients faster than they can actually hydrate, you need to let the dough rest for at least 5 minutes after the initial hydration, or gathering of ingredients into a ball. During this time the gluten will begin to set up and all the ingredients will absorb the moisture to their fullest capacity. When you begin pulsing again, it will not take very long to finish mixing. You can turn the machine to "on," rather than "pulse," but do not mix for more than 45 seconds. It should be finished by then. I usually wait to perform this longer mixing until I've made all the flour and water adjustments and the dough has the correct feel.

Some dough, especially wet, rustic dough, gets caught under the blade. If that happens, stop mixing, remove the dough with a plastic bowl scraper or rubber spatula (dipping it into water repeatedly to prevent sticking), then remove the blade. Clean the mixing bowl before returning the blade and dough and mix again to finish.

Note: There has been some recent discussion as to the relative merits of the metal versus the plastic dough blade. The plastic blade was developed specifically because it is supposed to be gentler on the dough, but very few people who use it find it effective. I agree with the recent consensus that the metal blade is superior to the plastic blade, assuming that you follow the mixing suggestions above.

If you are using an electric mixer, here are a few things to keep in mind:

  * Mixers tend to walk on the counter, especially under the stress of mixing bread dough, so do not leave the machine unattended.
  * Use the paddle attachment in the beginning to gather the ingredients, then switch to the dough hook. This is not necessary in bakery operations, but small batches sometimes are hard to get started with a dough hook because the ingredients tend to hug the walls of the bowl.
  * If the mixer seems to be laboring or straining, dribble in a few drops of water or liquid to lubricate the bowl and soften the dough. KitchenAid mixers now have instructions suggesting that you mix for no longer than 4 minutes to reduce stress on the motor. If you want to protect your machine, you can allow the dough to rest after 4 minutes of mixing and then resume 5 or even 20 minutes later. Remember the baker's maxim: Mix only as long as it takes to get the job done. If the dough meets the mixing criteria after 4 minutes, there is no need to continue, but there are many ways to extend mixing time, if needed, without damaging your machine.
  * Most standing mixers seem to work best with a dough that calls for less than 8 cups of flour. If the dough comes close to the top of the dough hook, take it out and finish by hand.
  * Mixers and food processors can overheat and overwork the dough if left unattended, so stay close by.

**MIXING RUSTIC DOUGH BY HAND**

Using a large spoon, distribute the ingredients and initiate mixing.

You can then continue to stir with a spoon, or you can dip one hand in water and use it like a dough hook, rotating the bowl as shown above.

If you decide to mix by hand, to knead in other words, a number of methods will accomplish the job. First, I prefer to stir everything together in a mixing bowl until the ingredients form a coarse ball of dough, then transfer it to a lightly floured counter and use the mellow two-handed press-roll-turn method. Some of my friends prefer to slap the dough around like a rag doll, whacking it on the counter until it stretches out, then folding it up and slapping it around again, giving the gluten a good workout. Between those two extremes are numerous other styles such as the one-handed press and the roll-press-roll method. There is also the two-handed squeeze-it-long, then-work-it-in-sections technique. Some people prefer doing it all in the mixing bowl as shown above with either one hand plunged in the dough (like a dough hook) while the other turns the bowl, or using a large metal or wooden spoon or plastic dough scraper in place of your hand. Rustic doughs are well-suited to this method since their higher hydration makes them harder to work with on a counter.

Once the three purposes of mixing have been accomplished, there is usually no reason to continue mixing and an important reason, in some instances, to stop immediately and proceed to the third stage of bread production (primary fermentation).

#### MIXING METHODS

In professional bread-baking operations, three mixing methods may be used: the _intensive method,_ the _improved method,_ and the _simplified method._ Each has its advantages, depending on the type of dough being made. For instance, rich sweet dough usually requires a long intensive mixing on high speed to accomplish fat incorporation and gluten development fully. Lean French-style dough does better with either the improved mixing method (a combination of slow and fast speeds), or a long, gentle simplified mixing on slow speed. Home bakers most often find themselves using a modified improved method (if using electric mixers) or the simplified method. This is especially true when kneading by hand, since it is impossible to replicate sustained high-speed mixing when it's just your hands and the dough.

Whichever method you use, the goals of mixing must be met without damaging or degrading the dough. The most common form of degrading comes from overmixing and overheating (which leads to overfermenting).

Each type of dough has its own parameters and requirements. Some require cold water, some warm water. Some set up quickly, others take longer for the gluten to bond properly. The type of mixing equipment or mixing method directly relates to the mixing time, so choices must be made by the baker to optimize the success of the mixing, and the quality of these choices will be reflected in the final product.

It is particularly important to remember that a dough's water absorption will vary depending on climatic conditions and the brand and age of the flour. Therefore, the water, or hydration percentage, in a formula can never be more than an approximation. For this reason, I strongly advise you always to withhold a small amount of the liquid in the first stages of mixing until you are certain the dough needs it. Likewise, if you have added all the required liquid and the dough still seems too stiff, adjust by adding more than the required amount. The dough, not the written formula, must dictate its needs. If it seems as though you have added too much liquid and your dough is too slack or sticky, then add more flour to make it right.

Before moving onto primary fermentation, following are some tips for accomplishing the three goals of mixing.

**Ingredient Distribution**

Each of the mixing methods described will adequately distribute the ingredients. When adding ingredients to the mixing bowl it is a good idea to avoid placing the yeast and the salt in direct contact with each other, as salt will kill the yeast in such concentrated contact. Instead, you can stir the salt into the flour, and then do the same with the yeast, or simply place the yeast and salt on opposite sides of the bowl prior to hydration and mixing. When adding pre-fermented dough or firm sourdough starters, break up these pre-ferments into smaller pieces so they will incorporate and distribute evenly.

**Gluten Development**

Gluten is the primary protein in wheat, providing both structure and flavor. It is composed of two partial proteins, gliadin and glutenin, which are able to link to each other when hydrated. When they link up, they create the more complex protein called gluten. Flour is defined by the amount of potential gluten it contains (remember, there is no gluten, per se, in flour until it is hydrated and the gliadin and glutenin bond). As discussed earlier in the chapter, each flour variety has a different gluten percentage. Regardless of the type of flour or its protein, every brand has its own capacity to develop gluten within a predictable window of time. Most commercial flour will develop gluten within 6 to 8 minutes of hydration. Typically, the higher the protein, the longer it takes for the gluten to bond fully, so high-gluten flour may require 8 to 12 minutes of mixing to develop.

One of the techniques that bakers often use to minimize mixing (and thus to reduce oxidation that causes natural bleaching of the flour) is to mix the flour and water for only 4 minutes, enough time to hydrate the flour fully, and then let the dough rest for 20 minutes. During this resting, or what the French call the _autolyse,_ the protein molecules complete their hydration and begin bonding on their own. Then, when the mixing resumes and the other ingredients are added, it takes only 2 to 4 additional minutes to complete the mixing process, during which the newly formed gluten molecules continue to bond to one another in more complex ways.

The most reliable method to determine when gluten development is sufficient is called the _windowpane test,_ sometimes referred to as the membrane test. This is performed by cutting off a small piece of dough from the larger batch and gently stretching, pulling, and turning it to see if it will hold a paper-thin, translucent membrane (see photograph, opposite). If the dough falls apart before it makes this windowpane, continue mixing for another minute or two and test again. It is very difficult to overmix bread dough, that is, to overwork the gluten to the point of breaking the molecular bond. It can be accomplished in professional mixing equipment if the dough overheats, or in a food processor, which can overheat dough very quickly, but most home-kitchen mixers will overheat themselves before overmixing bread dough. If you are hand kneading, you will probably cramp up well before your dough breaks down. I've never seen anyone overknead dough by hand, but I have seen dough oxidize and lose some flavor from overmixing.

_The windowpane test reveals valuable information about gluten development._

**Initiating Fermentation**

Yeast activation and the initiation of fermentation is, like gluten development, also triggered by hydration (hydration can come from either water or some other liquid, such as milk or juice). Regardless of the type of yeast used, it must be hydrated and distributed throughout the dough in order perform its leavening magic.

With the exception of active dry yeast, which must be hydrated in water first, both fresh and instant yeast will absorb enough moisture during the mixing and kneading process to activate. You can soften it in water if you like, but it is not necessary to do so. I prefer mixing it into the flour before adding the liquid.

## _Stage 3: Primary Fermentation_

_What many bakers don't realize is that good wheat can make bad bread. The magic of bread baking is in the manipulation and the fermentation. What has been lost... is this method._  
—Lionel Poilâne

Baking great bread really comes down to one skill: how to manipulate time and temperature to control outcomes. Control is a very important concept here, since every decision that the baker makes is reflected in the finished loaf. If the bread is underbaked or overbaked, it shows up. If it is improperly fermented, either for too long or not long enough, this also reveals itself. The baker's ability to respond and adjust to external conditions reveals the skill of the baker, and is also one of the most fun and challenging components of the craft.

Fermentation is the single most important stage in the creation of great bread. As we will see later, the baking stage (Stage Ten) also employs manipulation of time and temperature, but no matter how good your oven is, or how perfect your shaping technique, if the bread is not properly fermented, it can never be better than average. It is in this, the primary fermentation stage that dough is transformed from a lifeless lump of clay into a living organism.

Every dough has its own fermentation requirements, based on a delicate balance between the amount of yeast, yeast nutrients, and enzymes at work; the temperature of both the dough and the room in which it is fermented; and the length of fermentation. Some doughs are raised (fermented) in covered bowls or tubs at room temperature or warmer, typically for 1 or 2 hours, while others are chilled immediately after mixing, thus slowing (or retarding) the fermentation activity in order to draw forth more flavor from the dough through extended enzyme activity. (The latter is the principle at work in the _pain à l'ancienne_ technique I learned from Philippe Gosselin.) Professional bakeshops usually have controlled environments and closely monitor dough and room temperatures, but home bakers often have to improvise. Finding a warm place on a cold day can be a challenge, as can timing fermentation and proofing cycles to coincide with your schedule. When I make bread at home, I often set a timer to keep me mindful of the dough.

Whatever fermentation specifications a dough may require, it always comes down to a dance between time, temperature, and ingredients, especially sugar. Sugar is the one necessary ingredient for fermentation to occur, as it is ultimately converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide by the yeast. The sugar may be added either as an ingredient, or it may be derived, as it is for example in French bread, exclusively from the complex flour starch molecules as they break apart into simpler sugar molecules. Typically, the less enrichments in a dough, the longer the fermentation will take because most of the flavor will come exclusively from the wheat, the starches of which need time to release their natural sugars. In a dough that is enriched with added sugar, dairy, or fat, much of the bread flavor is derived from the enrichments rather than from the flour, so shorter fermentation time is preferable.

The following discussion is designed to empower you as a baker by giving you information that will inform the choices you make during the bread-baking process.

#### METHODS OF FERMENTATION AND TYPES OF YEAST

Here I am referring specifically to yeast fermentation. Bacterial fermentation is another type of fermentation that also affects bread, especially sourdough or wild-yeast breads, but it will be discussed later in this chapter. Yeast fermentation in bread is a result of yeast cells, primarily from the _myceum_ family of yeast known as _Saccharomyces cerevisiae,_ feeding on the simple sugars of glucose and, to a lesser extent, fructose and maltose (but not sucrose, or table sugar). Several strains of wild yeast, given the general name _S. exiguus,_ also can ferment bread, but this species generally comes into play in sourdough breads. Commercially produced _S. cerevisiae_ yeast is used in most home and professional baking for fermenting almost every standard bread.

Professional bakers are used to working with fresh yeast but are also comfortable with active dry yeast and instant yeast, substituting according to the following standard formula:

**100 percent fresh yeast = 40 to 50 percent active dry yeast = 33 percent instant yeast**

Fresh yeast is available to home bakers in some specialty and natural food stores, but its shelf life is only 2 to 3 weeks. Active and instant yeast has the advantage of almost unlimited shelf life. As a general rule, if a recipe calls for one type of yeast, it is usually acceptable to substitute another type following the substitution ratio described above.

SAF Products package a type of instant yeast called osmotolerant _._ It is grown for use in either very sweet or very acidic dough, as it is able to tolerate the high acid and sugar that normally slows down regular yeast strains. It is packaged in a gold wrapper and most bakers call it SAF Gold. There are only a few dough formulas in which this strain of yeast is appropriate. Although it may take longer to activate, regular instant yeast will also work in those formulas, so feel free to make those breads even if you don't have the osmotolerant yeast.

**A few more facts about yeast:**

  * Commercial yeast is grown and packaged under very strict hygienic regulations. The yeast cells are grown in a nutrient base that usually contains molasses and other carbohydrates. Yeast multiplies by budding (mitosis), and the manufacturing companies have perfected the ability to grow the cells rapidly and keep them alive in both dry and moist forms.
  * Large bakeries sometimes use cream yeast, a type not available to home bakers. The yeast and nutrient base are in liquid form and are thus easier to blend in high-speed mixing systems. Cream yeast is seen rarely except in bakeries producing tens of thousands of pounds of dough a day.
  * All of the commercial brands of yeast are fairly comparable in strength. Instant yeast contains about 25 percent more living yeast cells per spoonful than active dry yeast, regardless of the brand, due to the processing method. This is the reason why you need less of it than active dry. Also, active dry yeast is grown on larger grains of nutrient that have to be dissolved first in warm water (this is called proofing the yeast). Instant yeast comes on such small grains that it instantly hydrates when the dough hydrates and so can be added directly to the flour. This is the best reason to use it and why it is the preferred yeast in these formulas. However, you can certainly substitute active dry, or even fresh yeast for the instant if that's what you have on hand.
  * Once the package is opened, yeast will begin to absorb moisture from the air and slowly come to life. For this reason it will lose strength as it sits after it's opened, unless you keep it in an airtight container either in the refrigerator or the freezer. Some people think that freezing yeast will kill it, but I've kept a viable container in my freezer for over a year without it losing any discernible potency.

#### WHAT HAPPENS DURING FERMENTATION AND HOW IT CHANGES THE DOUGH

Here is the most basic piece of information to know about yeast fermentation: the yeast feeds on sugars, converting the sugar to carbon dioxide and alcohol (ethanol) as a digestive by-product. The ethanol evaporates during baking while the carbon dioxide leavens, or raises, the dough.

Among the axioms of bread making is this: _use only as much yeast as it takes to get the job done._ Too much yeast will leaven dough quickly, but it will also exhaust the available sugars and create an alcohol aftertaste. As the yeast starves for sugar, it begins turning inward upon itself, causing the yeast to create a less desirable by-product, glutathione, which creates an ammonialike taste that adversely affects the dough. Most standard recipes are formulated for a 60- to 90-minute primary fermentation, with a similar time frame for the secondary fermentation, or final proofing and rise. If the dough ferments faster than this, due to warm conditions or too much yeast, it is easy to lose control of the dough and end up with inferior bread.

#### THE IMPORTANCE OF ENZYMES

Enzymes are proteins that, according to food scientist Harold McGee, "are organic catalysts. That is, they selectively increase the rate of chemical reactions that otherwise would occur only very slowly." This is incredibly important information for a bread baker and serves differently for bakers than for cooks. In the case of most cooking, enzymes are responsible for hastening the degradation of food, in other words, spoilage. This is because in most foods, unlike bread (or beer and wine), fermentation is bad, not good. But in bread baking we are trying to ferment grain in order to leaven it. We are also trying to release sugars trapped in the complex starch molecules. Some of this released sugar becomes yeast food, but much of it becomes available to the palate as flavor and to the crust as color (caramelization).

Imagine a starch molecule, what we call a complex carbohydrate, as a ball of yarn composed of many threads of sugar molecules interwoven to create an almost impenetrable fortress. When we taste raw flour, or even raw bread dough, very little flavor is perceived by the palate because all the threads are wrapped around one another, making them difficult to discern. Flour tastes like sawdust because its sugar components are too complex to differentiate on the tongue. Now, introduce a catalyst, an enzyme, that acts like a wedge breaking apart that ball of yarn, freeing the various threads so that they become accessible, even vulnerable, to our palates or to other organisms such as yeast and bacteria. This is the degradation process of food, proteins, starches, and even sugars, that ultimately reduces all foods, in time, to simple sugars and thus makes them fermentable.

Bread bakers, knowingly or unknowingly, avail themselves of this natural process, interrupting it midstream during baking (Stage Ten) to capture the optimum flavors inherent in the complex carbohydrates and proteins. The outcome is that the freed sugars are manifest as a golden crust and a sweetness that was not present in the raw flour or the raw dough. When I repeat over and over the importance of manipulating time and temperature, it is this process to which I am referring.

Enzyme science is a large and complex matter in its own right, and thus could use an enzymatic catalyst to deconstruct it for laypeople like us, so this will be a very brief explication. The particular enzyme type that affects flour carbohydrates is called amylase, of which there is both an alpha- and a beta-amylase category. Whenever you see a term ending in "ase," it usually denotes an enzyme that acts upon the corresponding sugar ending in "ose," such as amylose, or lactase acting upon lactose (milk sugar). (There are also protein-acting enzymes, protease, that cause the same chain reaction in proteins such as gluten, initiating a process that affects structure more than flavor.) Amylose is a large category of sugar that includes subcategories, such as maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and dextrose. For instance, there is a type of alpha-amylase enzyme called diastase that breaks down some complex sugars into maltose, or malt. If you see on a label that one of the ingredients is malted barley flour, or if you see the term diastatic malt, it refers to the presence of active diastase enzymes within the flour. There is also such a thing as nondiastatic malt in which the enzymes have been heated to the point of deactivating or denaturing, usually to around 170°F. This type of malt is used as a flavor enhancer but not as an enzyme catalyst (it is often used in bagels).

During yeast fermentation, the yeast can feed properly only on the most simple sugars like glucose and, to a lesser extent, on fructose. There is a small amount of these simple sugars naturally present in flour, mostly due to starch damage caused during the milling process, in which some of the glucose strands are bruised. This is what allows French bread to rise even though no sugar is added to the dough (and even if it were, the yeast can't feed on sucrose, or table sugar, because it is a two-chain sugar and thus too complex for the yeast). While the dough is fermenting, the amylase and diastase enzymes go to work on the starches, breaking down the complex starch molecules into simpler components by breaking out the sugars. Given enough time, all the starch would degrade into sugar and eventually be consumed by yeast and bacteria, but the baking stage interrupts this process well in advance, and at the optimum time for flavor and texture (if the baker is good!). (Note: There is also a natural built-in ceiling regarding the extent to which enzymes alone can degrade starches, so there is a point beyond which even enzymes cannot go in releasing all the inherent sugar. But now we're talking rocket science...)

What happens in a properly fermented dough is that the maximum amount of sugar for flavor and color is released while retaining enough starch and protein to attain optimum texture. The full-spectrum bread-baking process is an acting out of this drama, this race against and within time to achieve maximum results in the areas of flavor, appearance, and texture.

Most bread flour now comes already enhanced by the presence of malted barley flour. Barley is sprouted, which activates the enzymes and begins the conversion process of barley starch to barley sugar (what we commonly call malt). This is then dried and milled into powder or melted into syrup. A small amount of the powder, loaded with diastatic alpha-amylase enzymes, is added to bread flour to promote the catalytic action referred to earlier. It takes a number of hours for the enzyme activity to accomplish its mission fully, which is another reason why long, slow fermentation produces better bread. As already noted, there is a built-in automatic brake mechanism in the enzyme-catalyzing process, limiting the degree of degradation enzymes can accomplish on their own. For this reason, it is not necessary to use a lot of malt; usually .5 to 1 percent is enough to do the job. Any more than that may cause the dough to taste gummy.

One appropriate use of malted barley flour with its diastatic enzymes is to promote better color in the crust. A small addition of diastatic malt (.5 percent) will dramatically improve caramelization by breaking out more maltose from the flour starch. Most of the time this is not necessary because of the malted barley flour added to the bread flour by the mill, but some formulas are improved further by the addition of a little more during the mixing stage.

Another result of this enzyme action is that more natural sugar previously trapped in the wheat is now made available to the palate. This is really the most important piece of information regarding enzymes, upon which we will soon create some interesting breads. To evoke the maximum flavor potential from the grain takes time. There are enough enzymes naturally occurring in flour that it is not always necessary to add them in the form of malted barley, as long as you are able to stretch time long enough to allow them to do their job. This is, in a nutshell, why pre-ferments create superior bread: they are a way to manipulate time, to stretch it, so that the wondrous chemical activity going on at the cellular level can fulfill its mission.

It is up to the baker to utilize the various fermentation options to their best effect. Almost any bread can be made in a variety of ways, and the formulas that have been passed down to us are not always the best ones. It has only been in modern times, for instance, that bakers have had access to refrigeration and other ways to control temperature. It is only in the past fifty or so years that chemists have figured out some of the internal drama that we have so blithely summarized in these past few pages. French breads, which were once made strictly by the 60-2-2 method (60 percent water, 2 percent salt, 2 percent yeast), can now be made by any number of formulas, using various types of pre-ferments, or none at all, such as Philippe Gosselin's _pain à l'ancienne_. The required method for making baguettes for the Coupe du Monde bread competition (the so-called "Bread Olympics") calls for using a _poolish,_ but _biga, pâte fermentée_ , and even combinations of these and other techniques also can make a superior baguette.

#### SOURDOUGH (WILD-YEAST) AND BACTERIAL FERMENTATION

To complete this section on fermentation we must discuss wild-yeast bread, better known as sourdough bread. The previous pages have focused on yeast fermentation enhanced by enzyme activity. But simultaneous to the yeast activity is a secondary fermentation, bacterial, that has a different effect on the flavor of bread. You will learn a method for making wild-yeast starters, followed by a number bread formulas that use this method, but here are some questions and answers that explain the broad strokes of this important process.

**All About Wild Yeast and Bacterial Fermentation**

_What makes sourdough different from regular bread?_ Most people think the difference is caused by a special wild yeast, but that is only part of the answer. Yes, a wild strain of yeast called _Saccharomyces exiguus_ is used to make sourdough bread, as opposed to _S. cerevisiae_ used in regular breads. But the complex sour flavor is not created by the wild yeast. Other bacterial organisms, specifically lactobacillus and acetobacillus, create lactic and acetic acids as they feed off the enzyme-released sugars in the dough, and these are responsible for the sour flavor. San Francisco sourdough bread, for example, has a particular type of local bacteria called _Lactobacillus sanfrancisco_ (what a coincidence!) that gives this bread a different quality, more sour with a thicker crust, than any other wild-yeast bread made in other parts of the world.

CHEMICAL LEAVENING

With the exception of one formula (Corn Bread), this book is not about chemically leavened quick breads, but I think it is important to clarify a few points about chemical leavening because so many bakers use it. We teach culinary students that there are three types of leavening: biological or natural (in other words, yeast or wild yeast); physical (that is, steam or aeration); and chemical (baking powder, baking soda, and ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate, which is rarely used by home bakers). Physical leavening is at work in just about every baked product, since as soon as trapped air warms up it begins to cause dough to rise. But the items we associate it with the most are laminated doughs like puff pastry, Danish, and croissants, as well as popovers and cream puff dough ( _pâte à choux,_ also called choux paste).

The most often-used chemical leavening is baking powder, with baking soda also used in many dishes. One form of ammonium carbonate is derived from the horn of a deer and thus is called hartshorn. When it is used by bakeries, it is usually for crisp, dry items like crackers, as all moisture must evaporate in order to release the ammonia taste.

Chemical leavening creates carbon dioxide, just as biological, organic leavening does, but it accomplishes this not through fermentation, but through a chemical process called neutralization. Simply stated, acid, which has a low pH factor (below 7 on a scale of 1 to 14), reacts to alkaline, which has a high pH factor (above 7). As the acid and alkaline react, or neutralize each other, the by-product of this action is carbon dioxide. Baking soda is very alkaline, tartaric acid (cream of tartar) is very acidic. Mix the two in a glass of water, throw in an aspirin, and you have instant Alka Seltzer (leave out the aspirin and you have carbonated water).

In any formula that contains baking soda, you are likely to see a corresponding ingredient, such as citrus juice, honey, vinegar, buttermilk, or sour cream, that is acidic. Typically, the amount of baking soda in a formula will range between .5 and 1.5 percent of the flour weight. Baking powder, which contains its own blend of acid and alkaline ingredients in a stable base, activates either when it gets wet or when it gets hot. Double-acting baking powder, which is what we mostly use in home baking, contains at least two types of acids. One type delivers what we call bowl action, meaning that it begins neutralizing the alkaline (usually sodium bicarbonate, which is baking soda) as soon as the two hydrate. This is commonly tartaric acid or monocalcium phosphate monohydrate. The remaining acid, such as sodium aluminum sulfate, is heat sensitive but not water sensitive, so it doesn't activate with the baking soda until it reaches about 150° to 160°F. We call this oven action. Typically, a formula will contain 1 percent to 5 percent baking powder to flour, but some formulas contain as much as 7 percent baking powder. Since much of this book is devoted to understanding ratios, these percentages, along with this rudimentary understanding of chemical leavening, should be an important part of your knowledge bank.

For more information on how these chemical leavenings work, I recommend either Shirley Corriher's _CookWise_ (Morrow, 1997) or Harold McGee's _On Food and Cooking_ (MacMillan, 1984).

_What does the wild yeast do?_ Regular commercial yeast _(S. cerevisiae),_ which is the same yeast used in beer making (which might explain why beer is often called "liquid bread"), does not like an acidic, or sour, environment. If bacterial activity creates too much acid, this type of yeast will die and make the bread taste funny, with an ammonialike aftertaste and a weakened gluten structure caused by the glutathione released by the yeast. Most regular _S. cerevisiae_ –leavened breads have a pH level of 5.0 to 5.5.

On the other hand, wild yeast _(S. exiguus)_ likes acidic environments (pH of 3.5 to 4.0) and therefore thrives when the bacteria does its work creating lactic and acetic acids. Since it takes about twice as long for the bacteria to create flavor as it takes for the yeast to leaven the dough, it requires a hearty strain of yeast to endure. This is why wild yeast is necessary to make good sourdough bread.

_How do you make or grow wild yeast?_ We do not have to make it since it already lives all around us in the air and on plants, grain, and fruits (it's in the white powdery "bloom" found on the skin of grapes, plums, and wheat berries). We do need, however, to capture it and cultivate it to make bread. We do this by making a sourdough starter or barm. A good bread baker knows how to keep the starter alive and healthy from batch to batch, and how to add just the right amount to make a tasty bread. This is part of the craft of baking.

The main trick in cultivating a starter is to feed it regularly with fresh flour and water, thus providing it with the nutrients and sugars it needs to stay alive. You can also keep a starter alive, but dormant, by refrigerating or freezing it, which also slows down fermentation by putting the yeast to sleep (yeast fermentation practically stops below 40°F). A healthy starter can be kept alive forever with proper cultivation. Some of the bread companies in San Francisco have been using the same starter, fed daily, for more than 150 years! We will go more deeply into the process of making a wild-yeast starter in subsequent formulas.

## _Stage 4: Punching Down (Degassing)_

Punching down dough, while very dramatic sounding, is more accurately called degassing _._ There are four reasons for degassing dough. The first is that it expels some of the carbon dioxide trapped in the gluten network, and too much carbon dioxide will eventually choke off the yeast. Second, it allows the gluten to relax a bit. Third, the temperature on the outside of the dough is usually cooler than the interior, so the punch down helps equalize the interior and exterior temperature. Finally, when the dough is degassed it allows for redistribution of the nutrients and triggers a new feeding cycle.

While many types of bread dough require a full degassing in preparation for the second rise, there are also many that benefit from a gentle handling, retaining as much gas as possible in order to produce large, irregular holes in the final product. French baguettes and other shapes of French bread are often judged by the quality of the holes, or webbing, also called the crumb.

_A cross section of raw French bread dough, with large pockets of gas that will eventually become the irregular hole structure of the finished bread._

When making lean, crusty breads, it's important to retain as much of the carbon dioxide as possible after the primary fermentation through gentle handling. These small pockets of holes become the foundation for the large, irregular holes formed during proofing and during baking that are the hallmark of high-quality hearth breads.

Some fermentation cycles require a punch down and then a second bulk rise, such as in long-fermentation lean dough like French bread. Technically speaking, as long as the dough stays in bulk, it is still in primary fermentation regardless of how many times it is punched down. Secondary fermentation only begins once the dough is divided into smaller units (Stage Five). For this reason, when the degassing stage is mentioned, it is specifically the degassing just prior to dividing and scaling. The degree or severity to which this is done is entirely dependent on the type of bread being made. There will be times when the punch down is simply the transfer of the dough from the bowl to the counter. Often this is enough action to release carbon dioxide and accomplish the four primary objectives outlined above. In other instances, where bread with medium-sized even holes is desired, such as in sandwich bread or dinner rolls, the punch down will involve total degassing.

I love transferring soft, rustic dough like ciabatta or focaccia from the bowl to the counter and watching it sink beneath its own weight, gently expelling gas but retaining enough to keep a nice, airy gluten network. The key to working with dough like this is to be gentle, handling it as little as possible to retain as much gas as possible. This can be done by keeping the dough well floured or by keeping your hands wet (wet dough will not stick to wet hands). This kind of wet dough does not get rolled so much as gently folded. Again, the objective is to retain as much gas as possible so that in the secondary fermentation, the proofing stage, the newly generated gas will stretch the dough out farther, resulting in large irregular holes in the final bread and thus a tastier loaf. The challenge facing those wishing to emulate the world-class breads now being produced at artisan bakeries is to handle the dough with, as the teacher of bread teachers Professor Raymond Calvel says, "an iron hand but a velvet glove."

## _Stages 5, 6, and 7: Dividing, Rounding, and Benching (the Middle Cycle)_

Most commercially yeasted and naturally leavened (wild-yeast) breads require two fermentation cycles. As a rule, dough first is fermented in bulk (primary fermentation) and then again after it has been divided and shaped (secondary fermentation, or proofing). Between these two fermentation cycles, the dough goes through three important stages.

Dividing the dough into individual pieces is the first stage of the secondary fermentation, quickly followed by rounding (preliminary shaping) and benching (a rest period, sometimes referred to as intermediate proofing). These three stages follow so closely together that we'll examine them in one section.

#### DIVIDING

First, the dough must be _divided_ and _scaled_ (weighed). This may be into a final size or into some form of intermediate size in preparation for subsequent dividing (for example, first weighing 16-ounce pieces to be divided later into eight 2-ounce rolls). When dividing, try to cut the dough cleanly (cut, don't rip) and with as few cuts as possible. Each time dough is cut, weak spots are created. These affect the final loaf if you have to combine two or more pieces to achieve the desired weight. Use either a pastry scraper (also called a bencher or dough scraper) or a serrated bread knife to make the clean cuts.

#### ROUNDING

The dough is then given a preliminary shaping, usually into a _boule_ (ball) or _bâtard_ (torpedo). This is called _rounding,_ and it stretches the gluten yet again and helps to form surface tension around the skin of the dough. This aids the dough in retaining its shape during the final rise. If the finished bread is to have large, irregular holes, the shaping should be gentle, with minimum degassing. If it is for a sandwich loaf or rolls, it is okay to degas fully during the rounding.

The rounding stage is best viewed as preliminary shaping toward the final shape (though sometimes rounding is the final shape if you are making round loaves). When the final shape is to be a long loaf, like a baguette, I recommend forming the pieces into _bâtards_ rather than into _boules_ since they make the final shaping easier. Over the next few pages are illustrated instructions on making preliminary shapes.

#### BENCHING

Depending on the type of bread being made, the dough may again be handled quickly, almost immediately going into final shaping, or it may need to rest for up to 30 or more minutes to allow the gluten to relax. This is called _benching,_ or resting, the dough. Though many of the breads in this book go directly from dividing to final shaping, you can apply the benching principle to any dough that resists shaping. The sole purpose of this stage is to relax the gluten after its workout during rounding so that it will be easier to handle during final shaping. Whether a dough requires benching depends on three characteristics that affect final shaping—extensibility, elasticity, and tolerance—all of which are determined by the condition of the dough's gluten.

**Extensibility, Elasticity, and Tolerance**

If the gluten is tight, it will make the dough very elastic or springy. The opposite of elasticity is extensibility, meaning pliable and stretchy. Bread shaping is always dependent on the relationship of these two attributes, plus one other, tolerance. _Extensibility_ is the dough's ability to stretch and hold a shape, _elasticity_ is its tendency to spring back like a rubber band, and _tolerance_ is its ability to be handled without breaking down. The elasticity and extensibility factors are primarily determined by the type of wheat or flour, but they are also influenced by the amount of handling the dough has undergone. Like a muscle, when the gluten protein is worked it tightens up to the degree of its natural, inherent elasticity. Tolerance is determined by the strain or blend of wheat.

Other factors that influence these three attributes include the amount of hydration (wetter dough is more tolerant and extensible, drier dough is more elastic and less tolerant) and the temperature of the dough (warmer dough is more extensible but loses some of its tolerance).

For example, when dividing a bulk pullman bread dough into smaller units for individual loaves, the units are first rounded into either _boules_ or _bâtards_ , then allowed to bench for 5 to 20 minutes before undergoing their final shaping. This benching gives the gluten time to relax so that the final loaf shapes will not spring back into _bâtards_. When shaping baguettes or other long loaves, it sometimes is necessary to give the cut pieces two or even three benching cycles, extending the dough in stages to the desired length. Each time the elasticity kicks in, let the dough relax so that it will become more extensible. The longer the benching, the more relaxed and extensible the dough will be.

What is important to understand throughout these stages is that the objective here is to both shape and prepare the dough for its final rise, or leavening cycle. Most of the flavor has already been developed during the primary fermentation. This is because the initial transformation that takes place when the dough ferments creates the most dramatic change in the flavor. The secondary fermentation continues some of the flavor development, but its effect is less noticeable than in the primary fermentation.

## _Stage 8: Shaping andPanning (Variations on Many Themes)_

There are dozens of traditional shapes for bread and multiple techniques for achieving them. Some are classics and appear under various names throughout the world, like _boules, bâtards,_ baguettes, and 12-inch _pains parisiens_ (also called stick bread in the United States and the most common shape for sourdough and French bread). Others are less common or very regional or seasonal. With the recent interest in traditional breads, home bakers have expressed a growing desire to learn the fancier, more difficult shaping techniques. There is even a surge in interest in artistic show breads.

One of the most difficult breads to shape properly is, surprisingly, the baguette. As ubiquitous as it is, and as inexpensive and simple in concept, this is the first shape by which apprentice bakers are judged. Again, many ways are used to achieve this shape, so it is important to view the following instructions as a starting point. You may have already mastered another approach or seen it demonstrated another way. Please understand that this is just one of many methods. As you make more and more bread, you will eventually add your own twists and turns to your technique. You will, knowingly or unknowingly, develop a shaping style that is distinctively your own. However, the methods that follow will get you well on your way.

The shapes that will be demonstrated in the following pages include _boule_ (ball), _bâtard_ (torpedo), baguette, _couronne_ (crown), _épi_ (sheaf of wheat) and other scissor cuts, _fendu_ (split), _fougasse_ (ladder), _tabatière_ (pouch), _auvergnat_ (cap), and pretzel, as well as sandwich loaves, _pistolets_ (torpedo rolls), dinner rolls, pull-apart rolls, knotted rolls, and braids. Not every dough lends itself to all of these shapes, but most dough can be shaped in a variety of styles. (Some recipe-specific shapes, such as bagel and brioche, are shown alongside the formula for the bread.) Accompanying the bread formulas are recommendations for which shapes are preferable.

Some shapes benefit from the use of special shaping devices such as proofing bowls or forms, canvas or muslin cloths, and shaped pans. However, even though these devices make life easier, it is possible to improvise and convert some common kitchen tools into useful shaping tools (see examples).

Most bread shapes begins with either a _boule_ or a _bâtard_ shape, so I'll demonstrate these first.

##### BOULE (BALL)

The _boule_ is the fundamental shape from which many other shapes can be made. For this reason we start here with one important principle: surface tension. The whole exercise of giving loaves this shape is based on creating a tight surface tension to allow the loaf to rise _up_ and not just _out;_ the tight skin causes the dough to retain its cylindrical shape rather than spreading and flattening. That is why the key step in making this is to press firmly on the bottom crease to tighten the surface (like getting the wrinkles out of a sheet). This can be done in a number of ways but the most common is by using either the edge of your hand or your thumbs to pinch the crease closed and exert pressure on the surface. With this understanding you can follow the photographs and, with minimal practice, become proficient.

Gather the dough to form a rough ball.

To create surface tension, stretch the outside of the dough into an oblong, being careful not to squeeze out the gas trapped in the dough any more than necessary.

Repeat this stretching motion, bringing the opposite ends together to make a ball. Tighten the surface tension by pinching to seal the bottom of the dough where the creases converge.

Set the _boules_ aside for proofing or to rest for further shaping.

##### BÂTARD (TORPEDO)

A _bâtard_ (literally, "bastard") is a torpedo-shaped loaf 6 to 12 inches in length. Aside from being a viable and popular shape in its own right, delivering a nice balance of both crust and crumb, it is also a good intermediate shape for making other forms. For example, rather than make a _boule_ as a preliminary step to forming a baguette or sandwich loaf, I prefer to make a _bâtard_ so that I am already part of the way there and will need less effort to finish the extension after a short resting period.

Gently pat the dough into a rough rectangle. Without degassing the piece of dough, fold the bottom third of dough, letter style, up to the center and press to seal, creating surface tension on the outer edge.

Fold the remaining dough over the top and use the edge of your hand to seal the seam closed and to increase the surface tension all over.

Set the _bâtards_ aside either for proofing or to rest for further shaping.

##### BAGUETTE

This is the shape made famous in Paris and is thus the ultimate city bread. The length varies from region to region, but for home bakers the real determining factor is the size of the oven. So while you may be able to make a perfect baguette shape as long as 3 feet, your oven may only be able to handle 12- or 18-inch lengths. For this reason, the instructions that follow are for 8-ounce, 15-inch baguettes designed for home ovens and baking stones. If you have access to a full-sized commercial oven, you can increase the weight to 14 ounces and the length to 24 inches. And if you have access to a bakery oven, you can make 28- to 36-inch baguettes scaled at 16 to 19 ounces, which will result in spectacular loaves.

Before referring you to the instructional photos, it is again important to stress the necessity of surface tension, as explained in the _boule_ instructions. This will not only enable the dough to rise in a tubular shape, but also make it easier to score the bread prior to baking.

After resting the _bâtard_ to relax the gluten, lift the dough and gently pull it out from the ends. Crease the dough down the middle and fold it as in the _bâtard,_ like a letter.

Seal the crease against the counter to create surface tension.

Working from the center of the loaf and moving to the outside edges, gently but firmly rock and roll out the dough to extend it to the desired length. If the dough is too elastic and springs back to less than the desired length, allow it to rest for another 5 minutes and then repeat the rocking and rolling motion.

Set the baguette aside for proofing.

##### COURONNE (CROWN)

Make a _boule_ and poke a hole in the center. Gently stretch it into a large, circular, doughnutlike shape.

Lay it down on a counter that has been dusted with flour and crease the four quadrants with a dowel or thin rolling pin; dust the cracks with flour to prevent them from sealing closed. Set the _couronne_ aside for proofing.

##### ÉPI (SHEAF OF WHEAT) AND OTHER SCISSOR CUTS

Shape and proof the dough as for a baguette. Just before baking, cut the dough with scissors at a sharp angle, nearly parallel to the loaf, cutting almost, but not quite, through to the bottom of the dough (the loaf must stay connected).

Swing the cut sections out and away from the loaf, spreading them as wide as possible from one another. Bake directly on the parchment-lined sheet pan.

You can make a wreath shape using the _épi_ cut by making a ring with a baguette and then cutting it as described above. Scissors can also be used to create interesting designs for any hearth bread shape, such as the dinner roll pictured below.

##### FENDU (SPLIT BREAD)

Sprinkle flour over the top of a _bâtard_ or short baguette and crease it with a dowel or thin rolling pin, pushing to the bottom of the dough without severing it.

Remove the pin and sprinkle flour into the crack. Crease the dough a second time with the dowel or pin, slightly widening and reinforcing the split. Again sprinkle flour in the crack.

Gently lift the dough, turn it over, and proof it, crack side down.

When proofed, roll it back over and bake it split side up.

##### FOUGASSE (LADDER BREAD)

**Method 1:** Use a pastry scraper to slit open and spread a proofed baguette just prior to baking it.

**Method 2:** Flatten a proofed _bâtard,_ then slit it with a knife in a pattern of your choice, spreading the cuts open just prior to baking.

##### TABATIÈRE (POUCH)

Make a _boule_ and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. Dust the top with flour. Using a rolling pin, flatten half of the ball into a thin flap.

Brush vegetable oil on the top of the ball and fold the flap back over the top. Set aside for proofing.

##### AUVERGNAT (CAP)

Make a _boule_ with a piece of dough. Cut another piece of dough one-quarter the size of the _boule_ and flatten it into a disk. Roll the disk into a circle the size of the top of the _boule_.

Brush a small amount of vegetable oil on the top of the _boule_ and lay the circle over the top. Press the circle into the _boule_ with your finger to seal the two together.

(You can also put a small bead of dough into the depression and sprinkle poppy or sesame seeds on top.) Set aside for proofing.

##### PRETZEL

Roll out 3 to 5 ounces of dough into a strand 12 to 15 inches long. Cross the ends to make a loop and give the loop an additional twist to anchor it.

Lift the two ends together, bringing them up to the widest parts of the loop, resting the tips just over the edge of the dough.

##### PISTOLET (TORPEDO ROLL OR HOAGIE)

Gently flatten the measured piece of dough and fold in the sides to square it off.

Roll it up and seal the crease like a _bâtard,_ creating surface tension.

Rock and roll the dough into a torpedo shape, exerting extra pressure on the ends to taper the dough. (You can also split the roll in the style of a _fendu_ for a more unusual look.)

##### SANDWICH LOAF

Flatten the measured piece of dough with your hand, folding in the edges to make an even-sided rectangle about 5 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches long.

Working from the short side of the dough, roll up the length of the dough one section at a time, pinching the crease with each rotation to strengthen the surface tension.

The loaf will spread out as you roll it up, eventually extending to a full 8 to 9 inches. Pinch the final seam closed with the back edge of your hand or with your thumbs.

Rock the loaf to even it out; do not taper the ends. Keep the surface of the loaf even across the top. Place the loaf in a lightly oiled loaf pan. The ends of the loaf should touch the ends of the pan to ensure an even rise.

##### DINNER ROLLS AND PULL-APART ROLLS

Clear the counter of all flour and swipe with a damp cloth to increase friction. Form your hand into a cup, place the dough inside. Firmly press the dough into the counter as if trying to push it through the counter, simultaneously rotating your hand in a circular motion, driving the dough with the outer edge of your hand.

The dough should pop up into your palm and form a tight round ball.

(With practice this shaping technique can be done with both hands at the same time.) **For pull-apart rolls:** Assemble any number of rounded dinner rolls on a parchment-lined pan, just touching, so they will rise into one another. After they bake, the rolls will easily pull apart.

##### KNOTTED ROLL

Roll out a measured piece of dough into a 6- to 8-inch strand (2 ounces for a dinner roll, 3 or 4 ounces for a sandwich or kaiser-style roll).

Tie a simple knot.

Loop the two ends through the center a second time, by imagining the face of a clock. One end should come through at what would be 7 o'clock, the other end should come through at 5 o'clock (one end will go down through the loop and the other will come up through the loop, leaving a small nub in the center).

##### BRAIDED LOAF

The most important principle in braiding loaves is to be sure each strand is the same weight and length. Also keep in mind that position numbers refer to the actual position of the strands on the counter (starting from your left) rather than to the strands themselves (thus, the number of a given strand changes as you move through the braiding process). To form the strands, use the same rocking-and-rolling hand motion used in shaping baguettes.

##### _2-BRAID_

Cross 2 strands of equal weight and length, and then take the 2 ends of the underneath strand and cross them again. Cross the ends of the other strand in the same manner.

Continue crossing in this alternate manner until there is no more dough.

Pinch all the tips into one another to seal off the ends. Lay the braid on its side.

##### _3-BRAID AND DOUBLE BRAID_

This is the only braid that begins in the middle. Place 3 strands of equal weight and length perpendicular to you and parallel to one another. From the left, number the strands 1, 2, 3. Beginning in the middle of the loaf and working toward you, follow this pattern: right outside strand over the middle strand (3 over 2); left outside strand over the middle strand (1 over 2).

Repeat until you reach the bottom end of the dough. Pinch the end closed to seal and rotate the loaf 180 degrees so that the unbraided end is facing you.

Continue braiding but now weave the outside strand _under_ the middle strand until you reach the end of the loaf.

Pinch together the tips at both ends to seal the finished loaf.

**For a double braid (festival or celebration loaf):** Make two 3-braids, with the strands of the first braid weighing twice as much as those of the second braid (example: three 6-ounce strands and three 3-ounce strands). Lay the smaller braid down the center of the top of the larger braid.

##### _4-BRAID_

Connect 4 strands of equal weight and length at one end, with the tips facing you.

From the left, number the strands 1, 2, 3, 4. Follow this pattern: 4 over 2, 1 over 3, and 2 over 3.

Repeat until you run out of dough, pinching the tips together when you get to the end.

##### _5-BRAID_

Connect 5 strands of equal weight and length at one end, with the tips facing you. From the left, number the strands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Follow this pattern: 1 over 3, 2 over 3, and 5 over 2.

Repeat until you run out of dough, pinching the tips together when you get to the end.

## _Stage 9:Proofing (Secondary Fermentation)_

Proofing is the baker's shorthand term for the ending phase of secondary fermentation. Both primary and secondary fermentation are a form of proofing (that is, proving that the yeast has enlivened the dough), and both stages are rightly called fermentation. But in professional settings, _fermentation_ usually refers to the primary fermentation while _proofing_ refers to the secondary fermentation.

From the moment the bulk dough is divided (Stage Five), the secondary fermentation cycle begins. The ninth, or proofing, stage is the climax of this secondary fermentation, where the dough is given its final rise in preparation for baking. For the dough to rise, the fermentation must create carbon dioxide as well as alcohol. As a result, more flavors are developed in the dough, but not as dramatically as in the first fermentation where the initial transformation occurred. The most important function of the proofing stage is to bring the dough to the appropriate size for baking. In many cases this is 80 to 90 percent of the desired finished size, with the expectation of additional rising in the oven (called the oven spring or oven kick). In some cases, however, the dough is risen to its full size with the expectation of little or no oven spring. In general, doughs proofed in freestanding form, such as for rolls or baguettes, are taken to the baking stage before they double in size, anticipating a nice spring in the oven. (If the dough is proofed until fully doubled it may collapse when it is scored.)

Proofing may involve loaf pans, proofing bowls or forms, or simply flat sheet pans covered with parchment (see Shaping and Proofing Equipment). It is important to use a size appropriately matched to the weight of the dough. The recipe instructions will offer guidance in choosing the correctly sized form and preparing it for proofing.

#### PROOF BOX IMPROVISATION

Professional bakeshops often use atmosphere-controlled proof boxes. These boxes control both temperature and humidity and allow the baker to predict the proofing time accurately. They are usually set to around 90°F and approximately 80 percent humidity. Control is especially important in production situations because the oven needs to be ready to receive the bread at the moment the bread is ready to go into it. If the dough isn't ready, then the bakery loses time and money; if the dough is ready too soon, it may overferment while waiting for the oven to clear and may not meet quality expectations by either deflating or failing to spring as hoped. As in life, timing is everything.

The home baker usually does not have to contend with these issues but does have to be vigilant in overseeing this stage. Without the controls of an expensive proof box, the options are either to proof at room temperature or in an improvised controlled environment. Temperature is extremely important in controlling proofing time. Every 17°F effectively doubles or halves the proofing time. For example, if dough will double in size in 90 minutes at 70°F (average room temperature), then it will only take 45 minutes if the temperature is 87°F. Conversely, it will take 3 hours if the temperature is lowered to 53°F. Any temperature variation within these extremes will affect rising time proportionately.

Proof boxes also control humidity. This is important because if the surface of the dough develops a skin, it will restrict the ability of the dough to rise, acting as a restraint. It also will affect the finished product, creating a tough, chewy crust. The presence of moist air keeps the surface soft and supple. There are a number of ways to replicate this effect in a home situation.

Food-grade plastic bags provide a somewhat controlled atmosphere. The bag protects the dough from any moving air that could dry the skin and traps humidity to keep the dough surface soft. Another advantage of a bag as opposed to plastic wrap, which also protects the surface of the dough, is that it fits loosely and therefore does not restrict the growth of the dough.

You can also use an inverted bowl large enough to cover the rising dough, such as a stainless-steel mixing bowl or a large salad bowl. If the bowl is large enough, you can even increase the temperature and moisture by placing a cup of just boiled water next to the dough before covering with the bowl.

This same trick can be done in an oven or in the cabinet of a microwave oven. (Note: if your oven has a pilot light, the temperature is probably too warm for proofing, so proceed cautiously, perhaps using it for only about 15 minutes on a cool day and then removing the dough to finish proofing at room temperature.) In a microwave, you can bring a cup of water nearly to a boil, and then place the dough inside and close the door.

An even more dramatic trick, especially good on cold days and taught to me by bread author Lora Brody, is to use an electric dishwasher. First run a cycle (without soap) to turn it into a steam cabinet. Then place the shaped dough inside and close the door. The temperature will be warmer than any other improvised technique, so the rate of leavening will be faster, about twice as fast as at room temperature. This is especially good for enriched sandwich breads in which the fermentation flavor is not as critical as in leaner breads. The cabinet is a little too warm for long bulk fermentation and will ferment most dough too quickly for best flavor, but it is excellent for final proofing, raising the loaf in 30 to 45 minutes.

When time is not a factor, it is still best to proof slowly and gradually at room temperature, as most of the formulas suggest. This provides maximum control and the best flavor, but usually requires at least 1 to 2 hours, or longer in some instances. Finding warm locations, such as the top of a refrigerator or near a sunbeam, can accelerate the proofing time if desired.

#### WASHES AND GARNISHES

In some instances, it is appropriate to wash the surface of the dough with a whole egg or egg white wash, as in challah or brioche, or to garnish with seeds or other toppings such as Dutch crunch. It is usually best to do this before the dough has reached its full size, as it becomes too fragile to tolerate the pressure of the brush and may degas and fall. Catching the dough at just the right point is probably the most valuable skill required at this stage. For example, waiting until French bread is at full size and then scoring it for the bake will result in flat bread. But if you catch it on the rise, the bread will spring mightily in the oven and bloom open at the cut points, as we will discuss in Stage Ten, baking.

There are some washes and garnishes that are appropriate to specific breads. For example, it is common to wash the outside of rye bread with beaten egg white to give it a clear gloss. Dinner rolls and brioche often call for a wash made from beaten whole egg, the yolk adding browning qualities to the sheen of the white. Water is the most common wash because it doesn't affect the browning, allows for the application of seeds and flakes such as rolled oats or bran, and also promotes oven spring and shine. I've seen instructions that call for white vinegar washes but do not use them myself, having seen little value in them. Likewise, I do not use water with cornstarch washes. However, I do like the Dutch crunch garnish on top of Vienna bread and sometimes on sandwich bread.

The most common garnishes for breads are poppy, sesame, and occasionally caraway or other seeds. Also popular are rolled oats and other grain flakes, and sometimes wheat bran or a dusting of flour. These are held on by spraying or brushing the top of the dough with water (or egg wash) and sprinkling on the garnish, or by rolling the dough on a wet towel and then dipping it into a bed of the garnish. The first option can be done before or after the final proofing rise, while the second option must be done before the dough has proofed.

When garnishing a loaf of bread, remember the general culinary rules that govern the practice. A garnish must be functional (edible), it must be beautiful, and it must enhance the taste. Garnishing gets young cooks into more trouble than most people imagine, sometimes costing them points on practical exams and even costing them jobs when improperly done. For example, mint leaves might supply the proper tone of green to complement the appearance of a dessert but will the flavor complement the taste? The same goes for bread garnishes. We do eat first with our eyes, so any choice of a garnish must enhance the eye appeal. But please be sure that the flavor of the garnish enhances and does not compete with or overpower the flavor of the bread, or, worse, obscure the flavor of the bread, as can often happen with excess flour or dry grain flakes covering the surface.

## _Stage 10:Baking_

There are many activities that take place during this stage, including scoring the dough, preparing and loading the oven, baking, and testing for doneness. The crux of the baking stage takes place, of course, in the oven, where three vital reactions occur: the _gelatinization_ of the starches, the _caramelization_ of the sugars, and the _coagulation_ and _roasting_ of the proteins. These are the final critical control points in determining the quality of the finished bread.

First the practical advice, then the hard science.

#### SCORING THE LOAVES

The purpose of scoring bread before baking is to release some of the trapped gas. This promotes a proper oven spring and an attractive finished look. The cuts are both functional and aesthetic. Often, they protect against trapped gas making tunnels or caverns in the bread ("the room where the baker sleeps," as this flaw is teasingly called among bakers). When done artfully, the cuts greatly enhance the line of the bread. Strong lines, whether straight or curved, are a hallmark of all food presentation.

Most of the time cuts are made just prior to baking, but occasionally they are made earlier. In this sense, scoring, cutting, slashing, or docking, as this process is interchangeably called, falls somewhere between Stages Nine and Ten. We'll place the scoring as part of the baking stage because the cuts, for all their aesthetic value, also provide a distinct functional benefit during the baking period.

The most characteristic cuts are the ones associated with baguettes and other hearth-style European breads. They are best made with a razor-sharp blade, such as a safety razor or a double-edged blade on a stick (the French call this a _lame;_ see photograph, below). The cut is made with just the tip of the blade to avoid dragging the back part of the blade through the dough (which would rip it rather than slit it). I often tell my students to say the word _slit_ when they make the cut to emphasize this over any other notion of cutting, like slitting open an envelope. The cut should not go straight down but rather on an angle, so that the slit is almost parallel to the surface of the bread. This will encourage a separation between the crust side of the cut and the rest of the loaf, resulting in what is called an ear. As the loaf bakes, it will spring in the oven, releasing some of the trapped gas through the weakest points, the cut points, causing the loaf to open in what the French call _la grigne,_ or "the grin," and we call the bloom. In competitions the loaves are judged to a great extent on the uniformity and consistency of the cuts and the quality of the bloom.

In some instances the cuts are distinctive to a particular village or baker. Similar types of bread may be scored in dissimilar styles. For instance, a _boule_ may be scored with a pound sign (#) or in a spiral, or with vertical side-wall cuts either intersecting or not intersecting, such as an asterisk or a sunburst. So, while there are conventions and protocols in the traditional European systems, there are really no rules other than what will serve the beauty and functionality of the bread best.

If you prefer to use a sharp serrated knife, or another type of blade, remember to let the knife do the work. That is, resist the urge to press down on the dough. Instead, let the knife bite into the dough and then gently slide it through, letting the weight and sharpness of the knife do the cutting and not any downward pressure on your part. This will slit the bread more cleanly, allowing it to pucker open rather than collapse under the pressure of your hand.

#### PREPARING THE OVEN FOR HEARTH BAKING AND LOADING THE DOUGH

Many of the breads in this book are hearth breads, that is, bread baked directly on the hearth or a hot deck of the oven. The instructions will often read "Prepare the oven for hearth baking." The purpose of hearth baking is to radiate heat directly into the bread as immediately as possible in order to promote oven spring and a crisp crust. Hearth baking may also employ steam to promote spring and contribute a shiny finish to the crust. Most professional ovens have steam generators that create a mighty blast of steam with the push of a button. Most home ovens do not offer this feature, although some home ovens are now being built with a steaming mechanism.

There are a number of ways to replicate a professional hearth oven in your home, although none quite match the professional oven's ability to retain heat and deliver a tremendous blast of steam. The first is the use of a baking stone.

You can slide your hearth breads directly onto a baking stone or unglazed quarry tiles using either the back of a sheet pan or a peel that has been generously dusted with semolina flour. (In some cases, it's fine to leave the dough on parchment during baking, as the recipe instructions indicate.) While nearly all breads can be baked directly on a baking stone, there are some that I prefer to leave on the sheet pan. These include enriched doughs (like the Potato Rosemary Bread) that tend to burn if they aren't insulated from direct contact with the stone, and doughs that are difficult to slide due to their shape, like an _épi_ -cut baguette. If you have confidence in your hearth-bread abilities, feel free to overrule my instructions for pan baking and go for the total hearth experience.

**LOADING THE OVEN**

Jennifer uses the back of a sheet pan to slide the loaves onto a baking stone.

Alex uses a peel, generously dusted with semolina flour, to slide the baguettes directly onto the stone.

The second way to replicate a professional hearth oven is to use the double-steaming technique. Steam is not required for all bread, but it definitely is important for hearth breads. The steam delays the onset of gelatinization, allowing the bread additional time to spring in the oven. It also lends an attractive glaze or shine to the bread. Its value is only realized during the first half of the baking process. After that the bread needs a dry environment in which to develop its crisp crust properly. For this reason, all of the steam is generated during the first few seconds of the bake, with its lingering effects fading out as the bread continues to bake. There is no advantage to steaming late in the process, nor even after the first few minutes, once the crust has set.

I used to advocate just spraying the oven walls with water to create steam, but then I discovered a better way. While the oven is preheating, place an empty heavy-duty sheet pan or cast-iron frying pan on either the top shelf or on the oven floor (thin sheet pans will buckle at high temperatures, which is why I prefer the cast-iron frying pan or a heavy-duty sheet pan). Before putting the bread in the oven, have hot water standing by, the hotter the better (simmering is fine). Don't use ice cubes, as they rob too much heat from the oven to convert them to steam. What we want is instant steam, not just water. The hot water is added to the steam pan when the bread is placed in the oven (A). When you pour the hot water into the hot steam pan, work at an angle and use hot pads to prevent steam burns.

**DOUBLE-STEAMING METHOD**

Add hot water to the preheated pan for a burst of steam.

Spray the walls of the oven with a mister to create extra steam.

In addition to the steam pan, use a plant mister, or go for the big statement and use a garden pressure sprayer. These cost fifteen to twenty dollars, hold a lot of water, and require some serious pumping to create pressure. The amount of water they spray creates great blasts of steam in a short amount of time. It is important to remember that the idea is to make steam and vapor, not to wet the dough, which causes splotches. Fill the mister or sprayer with room-temperature water. Aim for the side and back walls of the oven so that the water hits the walls and instantly vaporizes. Stay away from light fixtures or any glass. I learned the hard way to lay a towel over the oven window when I pour the water into the steam pan and when I spray. A little drop of water on hot glass, even on tempered oven glass, can begin that awful sound of crackling that sinks the heart and costs money. After spraying, quickly shut the door and wait 30 seconds, then spray again. I usually do three sprays at 30-second intervals to replicate as closely as possible the steam of a bakery oven, but each time the oven will lose heat. This is why its helpful to set the oven 50° to 100°F above the required temperature during the preheat stage. Only after the final spray do I lower the oven setting to the specified baking temperature, usually 450° or 425°F, depending on the bread. The oven will probably be below that temperature after all the steaming, but won't take nearly as long to recover as it would have had I set the temperature at 450°F to start.

In most, but not all home ovens, it is necessary to rotate the loaves 180 degrees in order to get an even bake. This is usually done about halfway through the suggested bake time, but remember every oven bakes differently, so baking times are just suggested, not written in stone. The best way to determine doneness is by placing an instant-read thermometer into the center of the loaf and bake to the suggested internal temperature.

LA CLOCHE

One method of simulating hearth baking (not required or called for in this book) is the use of La Cloche Covered Baker, a miniature ceramic dome that fits into your own oven. These are fun to use and do a great job of trapping moisture for a big oven spring and shine. They are expensive (about sixty dollars) and will break if dropped. They also get very hot and are tricky to use without burning yourself. However, if you have one, feel free to use it and have fun! Follow the instructions that come with it to make one loaf at a time.

#### UNDERSTANDING OVEN REACTIONS

**Gelatinizing the Starches**

Flour consists of approximately 80 percent starch, some of which reverts to various sugar chains during the fermentation stage, but most of which remains as complex starch molecules and granules. As Shirley Corriher explains in her wonderful book, _CookWise,_ starch is basically a configuration of "hundreds, even thousands, of molecules of glucose linked together." In other words, according to Corriher, "They are simply sugars hooked together." In the case of wheat and most bread grains, these are called amylose starches (the other kind of starch is called amylopectin, or waxy starch, and it predominates in tapioca, arrowroot, and cornstarch). Gelatinization, or gelation, is the chemical reaction that begins when starch and liquid are heated, and continues as the internal temperature increases until the starch absorbs and traps as much liquid as it can hold and then bursts, flooding the liquid with starch molecules and thickening the mixture. The bursting point of most amylose starches is between 180° and 212°F. This explains why 180°F is the minimum temperature that the center of a loaf must reach (and it will never exceed 210°F). As starches reach their maximum bursting point, they clarify, becoming translucent or semiopaque, and set into a mass solid enough to cut.

From the perspective of the baker's mission to evoke the full flavor from the grain, gelatinization is important for two reasons. The first is the obvious necessity to thicken the mass, transforming it from dough to bread. The second is that the palate responds to gelled starch in a different way than when the starches are not gelled. The glucose, or sugar molecules, of complex carbohydrates are so bound up, like a ball of yarn, that they taste like sawdust when eaten as flour and like paste when eaten as raw dough. The fermentation process and amylase enzymes trigger a breakout of the sugar from the starch, as discussed in Stage Three. But it is heat that transforms the remaining starches into a clarified gel as it gelatinizes the dough. This replaces the tastelessness of raw dough with a clear, cool, and clean mouth feel. The starches don't have a taste of their own, but when gelled they get out of the way and reveal the other flavors, thus releasing the hidden flavors usually obscured by the complex starches.

**Caramelizing the Sugars**

When sugar approaches 325°F, it begins to harden and darken, the process we call caramelization. We know from the explanation of gelatinization that the internal temperature of the dough will only reach between 180° and 210°F, which is not hot enough to caramelize the sugars, but the outside of the loaves are exposed to the full heat of the oven. The crust will nearly reach the temperature of the oven setting, causing the sugars on the surface to caramelize, which is why crust is usually brown. Furthermore, as the sugars heat up, their molecules recombine in various combinations with other ingredients, including proteins. In certain configurations these sugar-protein bonds brown at a lower temperature. This is known as the Maillard reaction, named after Dr. L. C. Maillard, who first discovered this type of caramelization, which actually occurs at a lower temperature than normal caramelization. The multitude of sugar chains brown, or caramelize, in different shades. A young 4-hour _pain ordinaire_ dough caramelizes as a yellow-gold shade. However, a _pain ordinaire_ dough made with 50 to 100 percent pre-ferment, or retarded overnight in the refrigerator, caramelizes as a reddish gold shade because the enzymes have had a chance to break out more of the maltose and glucose sugars trapped in the amylose starches. The effect of these various caramelization reactions shows up both visually and on the palate and is affected by the fermentation time, enzyme activity, and the oven temperature.

**Coagulating and Roasting the Proteins**

The third oven reaction begins with denaturing, then coagulating the proteins, but extends further into the roasting of these proteins as the dough reaches higher and higher temperatures. Denaturing happens first as a protein molecule is cooked. The tightly coiled molecules unwind and straighten when they reach 140° to 145°F, but soon after they wrap themselves up with other, similarly denatured molecules and create tightly bound protein chains. This is called coagulation and is most easily demonstrated in a scrambled or fried egg as the liquid and translucent raw egg gradually becomes opaque and firm. The same process unfolds in bread as it bakes. Since bread flour is approximately 12 percent gluten protein, and it is this protein that forms the skeleton structure that traps the carbon dioxide gas for leavening, as the bread bakes hotter and hotter, the proteins get cooked more deeply than mere coagulation. Baking, which means the application of heat to a food product in an oven, drives off whatever moisture isn't trapped in the gelled starches. This acts almost like a reduction, concentrating flavors. As the protein bonds become exposed to higher heat, more of the subtle, nutlike flavors emerge from the strands of gluten holding the loaf together. Once again, and true to the baker's mission, we are coaxing flavor from the ingredients.

#### HOW TO TELL WHEN THE BREAD IS DONE

Each of the formulas gives instructions for judging doneness, but here are a few general rules:

  * **Hard, crusty bread is baked until the center of the loaf registers 200° to 210°F** (I shoot for 205°F in most instances). Of course, if the outside is changing from golden brown to black, that is from caramel to carbon, you might have to pull the bread out before it reaches that internal temperature. Or, you can make a tent of aluminum foil or even of baking parchment and cover the bread with it to buy a few more minutes of baking time. The whole point of intense baking is to drive off excess moisture in order to concentrate the flavors. Also, the higher heat ensures full gelatinization of the starches, thus evoking more flavor from the grain.
  * **Soft bread, such as enriched dinner rolls and sandwich bread, needs to exceed at least 180°F** in the center. Small items like rolls will usually set as soon as they pass 180°F, but I prefer to wait until the dough registers 185° to 190°F for full-sized loaves to be sure there are no underbaked doughy sections. Also, thump the bottom of the loaves and listen for a hollow reverberation rather than a dull quietness. The sides should be firm rather than soft and crushable, golden with caramelization rather than white or uncolored.
  * **Always test the internal temperature by probing to the center of the center.** By this I mean place the thermometer through the center of the bottom or the top of the loaf and go to the center of the dough. This will be the last place to receive the heat and will thus be the coolest section. If it registers the temperature you seek, then the rest of the loaf will also be at least that hot.
  * **Cooling is an important part of baking,** but we will go into that in the next stage.

## _Stage 11:Cooling (Patience Is a Baking Virtue)_

Most people think that the job is done when the loaves are baked. Some systems list only ten stages, ending with baking. But, in reality, the cooling stage is important to understand because it is a continuation of the baking stage.

The loaves come out of the oven at a minimum of 180°F in their center, usually higher. Depending on the size of the breads, it may take up to 2 hours for them to cool down to room temperature. During this time they continue to evaporate moisture, drying out and, thus, intensifying in flavor. While the loaves are still above 160°F, they are, technically, still gelatinizing. This is why if you cut into a loaf right out of the oven, even one that is 200°F in the center, it will seem doughy or underbaked. The starches, though fully saturated and swelled with moisture, are still in the process of setting. The trapped steam either evaporates off through the crust, or it will re-form as moisture and be absorbed by the crumb of the bread. This process needs to complete itself for optimum results. If the process is interrupted by cutting or breaking the bread while it is still hot, the loaf will seem soggy.

Flavor intensity, though, is most critical. In culinary schools around the world students are taught that flavor comes first (Flavor Rules is the motto). The steps in the formulas presented in this book are designed to deliver breads of the finest flavor within their type. I encourage my student bakers to push their loaves, that is, to bake them as long as possible, but I also encourage them to push when cooling them. This means, in a word, patience.

The optimum time to eat most bread, and some people feel that sourdough may be the exception to this rule, is at the moment it cools to about 80°F in the center. There will be no residual warmth to cover or blunt the flavor on the palate. Of course, many people like to eat bread warm so that it melts the butter and tastes comforting in the mouth. There is nothing wrong with this, but if you want to taste fully the bread itself, with all its subtle nuances, then cool it completely, preferably by allowing it to sit at room temperature on a cooling rack. The rack will prevent condensation from forming on the bottom of the loaf or on whatever side it is leaning.

If you want to accelerate the cooling process, it is acceptable to aim a fan at the bread while it cools. The moving air draws off the heat and blows away moisture. This will cut cooling time in half, but it does tend to dry out the surface slightly. There is no advantage, as some people think, to putting hot bread into the refrigerator or freezer. This cools only the surface without effectively drawing out the heat. Moving air is far more effective. Many bakeries set up banks of fans to blow on the racks of bread that seem to fill up instantly every hour or so. The higher-volume bakeries even pass the loaves through wind chambers on conveyor belts. This allows the bakeries to begin packaging the bread before the next batch comes out of the oven.

## _Stage 12: Storing and Eating_

In the previous section I noted that bread usually tastes best just after it cools down completely. It is at this point that the flavor-baffling warmth is gone, the moisture has evaporated, thus intensifying flavor, and the bread is still fresh so that it is soft and creamy on the palate. It is never difficult to advise people what to do with fresh bread: eat it and enjoy it. However, it becomes more problematic to advise what to do with the bread that is in excess of what can be enjoyed after that perfect bread moment passes.

The twelfth and final stage of the bread-making process is, technically speaking, storing; eating is the grace note. But in production operations, storing is the realistic issue. The following few words will address storing methods, but after that I will offer some thoughts on how to recognize the attributes of a well-made loaf.

#### STORING TIPS

  * **Lean, crusty breads are stored differently than soft, enriched breads.** If you want to preserve the crustiness in lean breads, store them in paper, but they will become stale within a day and are best eaten on the same day they are made. If you want to preserve them for more than a day, "cater wrap" the loaves in plastic wrap (this means wrap them completely in both directions to prevent any air from getting to them). Then, either freeze or place them in a cool, dark place. You can also use zipper-style plastic bags, squeezing out all the air before sealing. When freezing, it is acceptable to preslice the loaf so that you can remove only what you need without defrosting the entire loaf. Snack-sized zippered bags are useful for individual slices.
  * **Soft, enriched bread, such as sandwich bread, is always best stored in plastic** and either frozen or kept in a cool, dark place (exposure to sunlight causes the loaf to sweat, creating condensation in the wrapper and, eventually, mold on the loaf). Presliced sandwich loaves are best for freezing, allowing the removal of only the slices you are planning to use (and they thaw much more quickly than whole loaves).
  * **If you have a frozen unsliced loaf and want to thaw it, pull it from the freezer at least 2 hours before you need to use it.** Do not try to accelerate the thawing by putting it into the oven or microwave. This will only dry it out. Of course, in an emergency, when you have to get bread on the table and have forgotten to thaw it in advance, you can quickly thaw it in the microwave or in a hot oven. The best way to prevent it from drying out is to place it under a wet towel. Heat the oven to 400°F, place the bread in a pan, and cover the pan with a towel that has been soaked in warm water and then wrung out. Check on the towel every 10 minutes to see if it needs rewetting. It should take 20 to 30 minutes to thaw out a standard-sized loaf, 10 to 20 minutes for a baguette. If you want to restore a crackly crust to the bread, remove the towel for the final few minutes and turn the oven up to 450°F.

#### STORING DON'TS

  * **Don't store bread in the refrigerator.** It dries out, even when packaged in sealed plastic bags.
  * **Don't store crusty breads in plastic bags or in plastic wrap** unless you plan to recrisp the crust in the oven.
  * **Don't store soft, enriched breads in paper bags** unless you intend to dry them out for bread crumbs or croutons.
  * **Don't store any bread that you intend to dry for crumbs in plastic bags or plastic wrap.** If the moisture cannot escape, the bread will eventually mold.
  * **Don't store warm bread in plastic bags or plastic wrap.** Wait until it has completely cooled down (no warmth at all), to prevent condensation from forming in the bag and thus accelerating mold development.

#### EATING

Culinary school training involves a lot of palate development. Just as wine expertise involves learning to discern subtle flavors in wine and match them with appropriate foods, so does any kind of cooking and baking also depend on understanding how the palate accesses flavor. The art of cooking is really about how flavors work together to create synergies, harmonies, or even disharmonies.

Bread baking is no different, especially in relationship to other foods and flavors. The challenge for a baker is converting a relatively tasteless raw starch into the sweet, nutty, multilayered flavor we call good bread. This is accomplished mainly during the primary and secondary fermentation cycles and brought to fruition in the baking stage.

When we eat properly baked bread there are a few things we should notice. The first is that the bread will be cool and creamy on the palate. The term cool and creamy is in contrast to dry and dusty. The opposite of cool, in bread, is not warm but dry. If there is any starch left in the crumb, it will manifest to the palate as a dry taste and, instead of tasting creamy on the tongue, it will have a dusty, almost gritty texture. This occurs not only in underbaked bread, but also in underfermented bread. One reason for this is that during fermentation much of the starch is undergoing a slow conversion to simpler forms of sugar. The palate also cannot access the flavors trapped in the complex carbohydrates that we call starch. In a well-made loaf of bread much of the sugar has sprung free from the starches, and some of these have been converted into food for the yeast. Some of the sugar has caramelized in the crust, and many of the previously trapped sugar molecules are now accessible by the five flavor zones of the palate (sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and the newly discovered, but controversial, rich zone, also called the _umami_ zone). Just as gravy becomes clear and shiny when it reaches the gelatinization point (recipes usually say to bring it almost to a boil), so too does the crumb of bread. When a thin slice is held up to a light, it will reflect and sparkle and sometimes, in breads that are baked to 205°F or more at the center, it will even be translucent.

Add to this flavor development the roasting of the gluten proteins, a process that begins when the loaf reaches approximately 145°F, continuing to add more and more flavor as the dough heats up to the 180° to 205°F range. It is like a coffee bean that releases new layers of flavor as it roasts, or like meat and other protein foods that also reveal hidden flavor as they roast. The protein in bread, which is somewhere between 12 to 20 percent of the flour weight depending on the type of flour and other protein-rich ingredients in the formula, also releases subtle layers of flavor due to the release of amino acids during fermentation and their reaction to the baking process. The deeper the roasting, the more complexity of flavor. This is why soft bread, usually baked to 180° to 190°F, does not tend to have the same intensity of flavor and is more dependent for its flavor on the enrichment ingredients than on the fermentation and baking technique. Crusty leaner bread, dependent almost entirely on fermentation and the skill of the baker for its flavor, benefits much more dramatically from intensified baking times and temperatures.

Much of how a bread's flavor develops through the three oven reactions is determined by the quality of the final rise. As noted throughout, crusty lean breads are improved by retaining a large, irregular hole structure, or crumb. The larger the holes, the easier it is to evaporate the moisture out of the loaf while it is baking, thus intensifying flavor by deeper roasting of the proteins and the fullest possible gelatinization of the starches. The tighter the holes, the more difficult to evaporate the interior moisture and thus the more difficult to raise internal temperatures to the extremes of 205° to 210°F. During the baking stage, the crust is engaged in a race with the crumb to accomplish their necessary processes in the same time frame. While the sugars in the crust are caramelizing, the starches of the crumb are gelatinizing and the proteins are roasting. When all of these converge and reach their peak at the same time, which is within the control of the baker's mastery of the oven and the baking stage, world-class bread is the result. Soft, enriched breads, usually formed with even, medium-sized holes, are not designed to reach the high temperatures required for world-class lean breads. Therefore, the flavor profile of a bread is within the context of that particular bread. Rich breads like brioche or panettone, sandwich loaves like white bread _(pain de mie),_ or tighter-holed rye and 100 percent whole-wheat breads are not all held to the same flavor and palate criteria.

What is important, though, is that bakers understand the outcome they seek in each particular bread, and use the knowledge gained in the study of the twelve stages of bread making to empower them to achieve it. If the baker's challenge is to evoke the fullest potential of flavor from the grain, then understanding how to manipulate time and temperature in all of the stages is the key to achieving this outcome. The knowledge and ability to meet the baker's challenge are now within your grasp—to the victors go the crumbs!

# _ Part III:  
 _Formulas__

The formulas are arranged in alphabetical order to help you find them easily. The sourdough and sourdough rye breads are grouped by theme, since the introductory information provided will apply to all the breads within that cluster. At the head of each formula you will find a brief bread profile and time estimates for the various preparation stages. The profile recaps the information from the bread classifications chart, and the time estimates give approximate times for each stage of dough preparation to help you plan your baking schedule.

Before you dive into any of the formulas, though, please take the time to read the previous sections to ensure that we are all on the same page regarding terminology, concepts, and theory. You may already be experienced and know this information but, perhaps, in a different way or from a different system. There are many ways to approach the teaching of bread, and mine is but one of them. I have no doubt that if you apply the knowledge gained in the previous instructional sections to the formulas that follow you will make amazing bread and, perhaps, even be able to revisit some of your favorite bread recipes and take them to the next level. At the very least, you will be able to troubleshoot problems with your bread and better understand the processes at work inside it.

Remember, my goal is to make you a spirit-of-the-law, not a letter-of-the-law, baker. This comes about as you develop a feel for your dough, adjusting as you knead until it feels just right (and you will know when it feels right!). As you develop this feel, you will also develop the confidence to make other adjustments, tweaking the formulas to suit your individual tastes and desires. Ultimately, I want you to own these formulas, to use them as templates for your own creative variations. As you embark on the adventure of making these breads, I send you off with what I call the baker's blessing: May your crust be crisp and your bread always rise!

## PRE-FERMENTS: PÂTE FERMENTÉE, POOLISH, AND BIGA

Many of the formulas in this book call for a version of pre-ferment, one of the baker's most effective tools for manipulating time. A pre-ferment's main purpose is to improve flavor and structure. The amount of pre-ferment required for each bread varies, so I am going to suggest approaches to preparing the pre-ferments that accommodate different batch-size requirements, especially with the main pre-ferments: _pâte fermentée, poolish,_ and _biga._

The very presence of _pâte fermentée_ in a formula immediately improves most bread, quantum leaping it in maturity and flavor. One way to make it is to make a batch of dough as shown in the recipe for Pâte Fermentée—which is, in fact, simply French bread dough—and put it in the refrigerator overnight. In the French bread formula you will use this whole piece in the final dough, but other formulas in the book might require more or less. So, in the following formula, as is true with every formula, the most important information is the percentage ratio of each ingredient. With this, you can customize your batch sizes, making exactly the amount you need.

The other option is to save back a portion of every batch of French bread that you make to use as pre-ferment in future batches. The dough will keep for 3 days in the refrigerator and at least 3 months in the freezer if you store it in an airtight freezer bag.

_Poolish,_ a wet sponge, is easy to make and is best when made fresh each time you need it. It will, however, also be good for up to 3 days in the refrigerator, and it too can be frozen if you choose to do so. It is inexpensive to make, so it is okay to make more than you need and discard any excess. The formula is the easiest of all to make, since the flour and water weigh the same and it can be mixed with a spoon.

_Biga,_ the Italian version of a firm pre-ferment, is as easy to make as French bread dough and should feel about the same (the main difference from _pâte fermentée_ is the absence of salt and, therefore, the need for less yeast). Again, the percentages are most important; with them you can make this in any size, as needed.

A _poolish_ and a _biga_ are interchangeable in a recipe (you may have some leftover from one batch and be looking for a dough in which to use it). However, you will have to adjust the water content in the final dough to compensate for the difference in hydration between them.

Interchangeability also applies to wet starters (barms) and firm wild-yeast starters, again as long as you remember to adjust the water in the final dough. Such substitutions will result in a different flavor and structure in the final dough, so we're in the realm of baker's choice here. In most of my sourdough formulas, I use a wet starter to make a firm starter and then the final dough, but there are other times when I use the wet starter to make the final dough. The point here is that it is okay to interchange pre-ferments, and I encourage you to experiment to learn which options you prefer.

##  Pâte Fermentée

Makes 16 to 17 ounces (enough for 1 batch of French Bread, _Pain de Campagne, or Pane Siciliano)_

1⅛ cups (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour

1⅛ cups (5 ounces) unbleached bread flour

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

½ teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast

¾ cup to ¾ cup plus

2 tablespoons (6 to 7 ounces) water, at room temperature

**1. Stir together the flours, salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add ¾ cup of the water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water, according to need, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.)

**2. Sprinkle some flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. The internal temperature should be 77° to 81°F.

**3. Lightly oil a bowl** and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 1 hour, or until it swells to about 1½ times its original size.

**4. Remove the dough** from the bowl, knead it lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it in an airtight plastic bag for up to 3 months.

COMMENTARY

You can use this on the same day that you make it, if you ferment it at room temperature for 2 hours instead of refrigerating it. I prefer to give it the overnight treatment, however, as it seems to bring out even more flavor.

If you only have bread flour or only all-purpose flour, you may make this pre-ferment with that flour exclusively, but the blend seems to bring about the best results.

BAKER'S PERCENTAGE FORMULA

**Pâte Fermentée** | **%**  
---|---  
Bread flour | 100  
Salt | 1.9  
Instant yeast | .55  
Water (approx.) | 65  
**Total** | **167.5**

##  Poolish

Makes about 23 ounces (enough for Ciabatta, _Poolish_ Version)

2½ cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1½ cups (12 ounces) water, at room temperature

¼ teaspoon (.03 ounce) instant yeast

**Stir together the flour, water, and yeast** in a mixing bowl until all of the flour is hydrated. The dough should be soft and sticky and look like very thick pancake batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours, or until the sponge becomes bubbly and foamy. Immediately refrigerate it. It will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.

COMMENTARY

You can make this in larger or smaller batches, depending on the formula you plan to use it in, or make more than you need and use the leftover in another bread, such as _Poolish_ Baguettes.

The _poolish_ sponge can be used as soon as it ferments, but as with other pre-ferments, I prefer to give it an overnight retarding to draw out more flavor.

It is acceptable to substitute _biga_ for _poolish_ and vice versa, as long as you adjust the water in the final formula to compensate for the change.

BAKER'S PERCENTAGE FORMULA

**Poolish** | **%**  
---|---  
Bread flour | 100  
Water | 107  
Instant yeast | .27  
**Total** | **207.3**

##  Biga

Makes about 18 ounces (enough for Ciabatta, _Biga_ Version; or Italian Bread)

2½ cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

½ teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast

¾ cup plus 2 table-spoons to 1 cup (7 to 8 ounces) water, at room temperature

**1. Stir together the flour and yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons of the water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water, according to need, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.)

**2. Sprinkle some flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. The internal temperature should be 77° to 81°F.

**3. Lightly oil a bowl** and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, or until it nearly doubles in size.

**4. Remove the dough** from the bowl, knead it lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it in an airtight plastic bag for up to 3 months.

COMMENTARY

_Biga_ will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for about 3 months. You can use it as soon as it ferments, but just as for _poolish_ and _pâte fermentée,_ I prefer to give it an overnight retarding to bring out more flavor.

In Italy nearly every pre-ferment, including wild yeast or sourdough, is called a _biga_ _._ So if you are making a recipe from another source that calls for _biga,_ make sure you check to see exactly what kind of _biga_ it requires. In this book, _biga_ refers to the particular ratio of ingredients listed here.

You can substitute all-purpose flour for the bread flour if you prefer, or blend all-purpose and bread flour as in _pâte fermentée._

##  Anadama Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 5 minutes soaker

_Day 2:_ 1¼ hours sponge; 15 minutes mixing; 2 ¾ to 3¼ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 40 to 50 minutes baking

Now that I live in New England again, after twenty-two years in California, I felt duty bound to revisit one of the great New England breads, anadama, and to come up with a definitive version. There are conflicting stories of the origin of the name. Judith and Evan Jones, in their wonderful _The Book of Bread_ , tell the story of a Rockport, Massachusetts, man who was upset with his wife not only for leaving him, but also for leaving behind only a pot of cornmeal mush and some molasses. The angry husband tossed the mush and molasses together with some yeast and flour and muttered, "Anna, damn 'er!" This was later amended by the more genteel local Yankees, as they retold the story, to anadama. Sounds likely to me.

Traditional formulas for this bread are usually given as a direct-dough method, but this version utilizes a soaker and a sponge to evoke more flavor from the grain. Corn is chock-full of natural sugars, trapped in the complex carbohydrate starch base, so any trick we can employ to break the sugars free can only improve the already wonderful flavor.

Makes two 1½-pound loaves, or three 1-pound loaves

**SOAKER**

1 cup (6 ounces) cornmeal, preferably coarse grind (also packaged as "polenta")

1 cup (8 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DOUGH**

4½ cups (20.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

1 cup (8 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

6 tablespoons (4 ounces) molasses

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) shortening or unsalted butter, at room temperature

Cornmeal for dusting (optional)

**1. The day before making the bread,** make the soaker by mixing the cornmeal and water in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit overnight at room temperature.

**2. The next day, to make the dough,** stir together 2 cups of the flour, the yeast, soaker, and water in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and ferment for 1 hour, or until the sponge begins to bubble.

**3. Add the remaining 2½ cups of flour,** the salt, molasses, and shortening and stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. Add water if necessary to make a soft, slightly sticky mass.

**4. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook), sprinkling in more flour as needed to make a tacky, but not sticky, dough. The dough should be firm but supple and pliable and definitely not sticky. It will take about 10 minutes of kneading to accomplish this (or 6 to 8 minutes in the electric mixer). The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F.

**5. Lightly oil a bowl** and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment the dough at room temperature for about 90 minutes, or until it doubles in size.

**6. Remove the dough from the bowl** and divide it into 2 equal pieces of 24 ounces, or 3 pieces of about 16 ounces. Shape the dough into loaves, and place them into bread pans that have been lightly oiled or misted with spray oil (the larger loaves should go into 9 by 5-inch pans and the smaller loaves into 8½ by 4½-inch pans). Mist the tops of the loaves with spray oil and loosely cover the tops with plastic wrap.

**7. Proof at room temperature** for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the loaves crest fully above the tops of the pans. (If you want to hold back any of the loaves, place them in the refrigerator without proofing, where they will hold, or retard, for up to 2 days. Remove them from the refrigerator about 4 hours before baking and proof them at room temperature, or until ready.)

**8. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Place the pans on a sheet pan and remove the plastic wrap. Mist the tops with a spray of water and dust with cornmeal.

**9. Place the sheet pan in the oven** and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the sheet pan for even baking and continue to bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown, including along the sides and bottom, and register at least 185° to 190°F in the center. They should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom.

**10. When the loaves are done,** remove them immediately from the pans and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

The brand or type of molasses will make a difference in the final flavor. People who tested this formula preferred Brer Rabbit Golden Molasses for its lightness. Molasses is high in iron and other minerals, but some brands are harsher and darker. I suggest using the lightest, most refined brand you can find, unless you like the stronger flavor tones of darker brands.

The amount of flour may vary depending on the type of molasses you use, so do not be concerned if you have to add more to firm up the dough. Let the dough dictate how much flour it needs; you want a dough that is slightly tacky but not sticky, and supple enough for easy shaping.

##  Artos: Greek Celebration Breads

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast or mixed leavening method

DAYS TO MAKE: 1 OR 2

_Day 1:_ 1 hour to de-chill barm; 15 minutes mixing; 2¾ to 3¼ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 40 to 45 minutes baking ( _for poolish_ version: 3 to 4 hours _poolish_ )

_Day 2:_ ( _Poolish_ version only) 1 hour to de-chill _poolish_ ; 15 mintes mixing; 2¾ to 3¼ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 40 to 45 minutes baking

When it comes to holiday and festival breads, the varieties and secret family recipes are endless. But when broken down to their basic components, they are pretty much variations on a theme. This is especially evident in the various Greek breads. _Artos_ is the general name for Greek celebration breads, but they are given particular names and twists and turns for specific festivals. It is the twists ands turns that make the breads special, bringing visual drama, history, and family tradition into the process. For instance, the color of the fruit is different for Christmas breads than for Easter since Christmas is a festival of incarnation, while Easter is a festival of resurrection and transformation. The breads are often brought to church by home bakers, blessed by the priest, and then brought to the table or given to the needy. I love the designs of the nativity _christopsomos,_ with its bread-dough cross laminated on top of a round loaf and of the Easter egg–braided _lambropsomo,_ also called _tsoureki_ (a Turkish variation). The orange and brandied _vassilopita,_ served on New Year's Day in honor of Saint Basil, always has a gold coin hidden in it, not unlike the three kings cake of New Orleans and Spanish cultures.

The following master formula can be used as the base for any of these breads, and some specific holiday variations follow. The formula uses a wild-yeast starter, along with a spiking of commercial yeast, to create an authentic-tasting, yet manageable, bread. Nowadays, most versions are made completely from commercial yeast, but this is only a recent innovation. If you do not have any barm on hand, you may replace it with an equal amount of _poolish._ The fermentation and proofing times will remain the same.

COMMENTARY

If you can find authentic spices like mahleb (also called mahlepi seed, extracted from the pits of Santa Lucia cherries) and ground mastic, you can substitute them in equal measure for the spices listed (mahleb for the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice; mastic for the clove).

###  Greek Celebration Bread

Makes 1 large loaf

1 cup (7 ounces) barm or _poolish_

3½ cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce) instant yeast

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) ground cinnamon

¼ teaspoon (.03 ounce) ground nutmeg

¼ teaspoon (.03 ounce) ground allspice

¼ teaspoon (.03 ounce) ground cloves

1 teaspoon (.16 ounce) minced orange or lemon zest or extract

1 teaspoon (.16 ounce) almond extract

2 large (3.3 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

¼ cup (2.67 ounces) honey

¼ cup (2 ounces) olive oil

¾ cup (6 ounces) whole or low-fat milk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

**OPTIONAL GLAZE**

2 tablespoons water

2 tablespoons sugar

2 tablespoons honey

1 teaspoon orange or lemon extract

1 teaspoon sesame seeds

**1. Remove the measured amount of barm** from the refrigerator 1 hour before making the dough. (If using _poolish,_ make it the day before.)

**2. Stir together** the flour, salt, yeast, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves in a large mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the barm or _poolish,_ the extracts, eggs, honey, oil, and milk. Stir together with a sturdy spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the dough forms a ball.

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Add more milk or flour as needed to form the dough into a soft, but not sticky, ball. It should be tacky and very supple. Knead (or mix) for approximately 10 minutes. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F.

**4. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough** to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment the dough at room temperature for 90 minutes, or until it doubles in size.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl** and shape it into a _boule_. Transfer it to a sheet pan that has been lined with baking parchment. Mist the dough with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap.

**6. Proof at room temperature** for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the dough nearly doubles in size.

**7. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**8. Bake the loaf** for 20 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the loaf is golden brown and registers 190°F. It should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom. You may glaze the loaf as soon as it comes out of the oven, if desired.

**9. To make the glaze,** combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the honey and extract and turn off the heat. Reheat the glaze, if necessary, before applying it to the bread. Brush the loaves with the glaze and immediately sprinkle the loaves with sesame seeds.

**10. Transfer the bread to a rack** and cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

###  Christopsomos

Makes 1 large loaf

Greek Celebration Bread

½ cup dark, golden, or mixed raisins

½ cup dried cranberries, dried cherries, or chopped dried figs (or any combination)

½ cup chopped walnuts, lightly toasted

**Prepare the dough for the celebration bread,** mixing in the raisins, dried fruit, and walnuts during the final 2 minutes of the mixing in Step 3. Proceed as for the celebration bread, but before shaping the dough into a _boule,_ divide it into 2 pieces, 1 piece twice as big as the other. Shape the larger piece into a _boule,_ and proof as described in Steps 5 and 6. Place the smaller piece in a plastic bag and chill in the refrigerator. When the larger piece is ready to bake, remove the smaller piece from the refrigerator, divide it in half, and roll each half into a 10-inch-long strand. Shape the final dough as shown below.

SHAPING CHRISTOPSOMOS

Cross the 2 strands of dough over the top of the _boule_.

Using a pastry scraper, split the ends of each strand and coil them to form a decorative cross.

###  Lambropsomo

Makes 1 large loaf

Greek Celebration Bread

¾ cup golden raisins

¼ cup chopped dried apricots

½ cup blanched slivered almonds, slightly toasted

3 hard-cooked eggs, dyed red

**Prepare the dough** for the celebration bread, mixing in the raisins, apricots, and the almonds during the final 2 minutes of the mixing in Step 3. Proceed as for the celebration bread, but instead of shaping into a _boule,_ divide the dough into 3 equal pieces and braid using the 3-braid method. Nestle the eggs in the spaces between the braided strands.

_Bagels_

##  Bagels

BREAD PROFILE:

Lean, stiff dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 2 hours sponge; 10 to 15 minutes mixing; 1 to 1½ fermentation, shaping, and proofing

_Day 2:_ 10 minutes boiling; 15 to 20 minutes baking

There are two kinds of people in the world, those who like chewy water bagels and those who prefer softer steamed bagels. Having grown up on the East Coast in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, I am naturally inclined toward what I think of as the true bagel, the thick-crusted, dense, boiled version, called the water bagel because it is poached in a kettle of boiling alkalized water. (I also like egg bagels, which are made by adding eggs as an enrichment to the dough but, nevertheless, are boiled.)

Most people who like the new style of softer bagels, and there are many such adherents, do not realize that what makes them so big and soft is that they are a softer dough, formed after a long proofing. This makes them impossible to boil because they are too airy to sustain their shape in the roiling cauldron. They are perfect for commercial steam-injected rotating rack ovens, however, because they do not have to be handled twice. (The oven lifts the entire rack of sheet pans and rotates it for even baking, after blasting it with a bath of steam to replace the boiling.)

According to folklore, bagels were invented in seventeenth-century Austria as a tribute to the wartime victories of King Jan of Poland, and were modeled after the stirrup of his saddle. They were a bread for the masses, popular also in Germany and Poland, but they were introduced into the United States by German and Polish Jewish immigrants, so we think of them as a Jewish bread. Now, because of the softer steamed versions, bagels have once again become a bread for the masses. However, the modern steaming method lends fuel to the debate of authenticity and battles against our nostalgic desire for the real deal. Everyone who loves bagels seems to have a theory as to why even properly boiled bagels seem to fall short of those memories. Some think it depends on the quality of the water. "New York bagels can't be duplicated because of that great New York water," say New Yorkers, while others think it has something to do with the quality of the flour, or whatever else they put into the kettle to flavor the crust. Others blame the automatic bagel-shaping machines invented by Tom Atwood in the 1950s. (Prior to that, Tom, now in his eighties, told me, all bagels were shaped by hand using the wrap-around method.) My theory is that nothing can top the taste of memory, but it is quite possible to find and make bagels every bit as good as in yesteryear, though never as good as those of our memories.

As a professional baker, a bread instructor, and a water-bagel guy, I've been working on making the perfect bagel for a number of years. Just as the steam technique is a totally modern innovation that opened the bagel to the mainstream marketplace, there are many techniques that are now available to both professional and home bakers that did not exist in the days of King Jan. Even the bagel bakers of our parents' generation did not fully understand bread science as we now know it, though their feel for the product and their intuition was sharpened to a fine edge. What I have been working on is the application of some of the artisan techniques recently introduced by the new generation of bread bakers to the production of a definitive water bagel good enough to challenge our childhood memories and overcome our nostalgic biases. You will have to be the judge. This version is, I believe, an improvement on the formula given in _Crust & Crumb,_ which I thought at the time was as good as it gets. This version uses an easier-to-make sponge, yet still provides the overnight fermentation that maximizes flavor. My students at Johnson & Wales University are too young to have had a "good old days" experience with bagels, so even though they love these bagels, their frame of reference is limited. But my wife Susan who, like me, grew up in the food and bagel mecca of Philadelphia, and some of my friends who grew up in New York City (the bagel center of the universe), feel that this is a bagel for the ages.

Most bagel shops use two ingredients that are hard for home bakers to find. One is high-gluten flour and the other is malt syrup. High-gluten flour, which contains up to 14 percent gluten protein as opposed to the 12 percent found in bread flour and the 10 percent in all-purpose flour, provides the elasticity and tough chew associated with classic water bagels. This flour can be purchased in at least three ways. One is through mail order, such as the Baker's Catalogue (operated by King Arthur Flour). Another option is at specialty or natural foods markets (ask for unbleached hard spring wheat flour). The third option, and not as unusual as you might think, is to throw yourself upon the mercy of your local bagel shop, explaining that you are a home baker on a quest to make a great bagel and would love to buy just a few pounds of flour from their stock. You'd be surprised how well this works. If all else fails, feel free to use regular bread flour, which still delivers a great, though not quite as chewy, bagel.

Malt syrup can be had in the same way; it can also be found at natural foods markets under the name "barley syrup." Most bagel shops use liquid nondiastatic malt, a thick, sticky molasseslike syrup. The word _diastatic_ refers to diastase enzymes found in barley malt that help break down carbohydrates and release flavors trapped in the flour. Nondiastatic malt has been heated to the point of neutralizing the enzymes, so the malt is used strictly for its flavor. However, I often use active diastatic malt, available in powder or crystal form from mail-order catalogs or at beer-making supply stores. This "live" malt provides the added ability to improve flavor enzymatically by hastening the release of natural sugars bound up in the flour starches. Regardless of the type of malt you use, it will give the bagels the familiar bagel shop flavor. However, if you cannot find malt and want to proceed anyway, you may substitute either honey or brown sugar for wonderful, though less authentic, flavor.

In all of my bread travels I have never found a bagel shop that uses the following sponge technique. I am convinced, however, that it not only gives the bagels a better flavor and texture, but also allows these bagels to freeze and thaw better than commercially produced bagels due to the increase of natural acid produced by the method. The operating premise is that longer, slower fermentation improves both the flavor and shelf life of the product. The sponge, or pre-ferment, technique is one way to extend fermentation, as is the overnight retarding technique used in any respectable bagel shop. It is impossible, in my opinion, to make a decent bagel without the overnight method, though I've seen many recipes in cookbooks that leave out this vital step. Believe me, you will never achieve a legendary bagel without the benefits of a long, slow, cold fermentation, which allows the naturally occurring enzymes (and any additional enzymes provided by the malt) to release flavors. Making a bagel without this step is like drinking a fine wine just after it's been put in the bottle. The flavors are there in potential, but not fully realized. (If you think about it, the reasons for this binding of flavors in immature wine or bread is due to the same circumstances—sugars that have not had time to unwind from their complex-carbohydrate base.)

Another important principle in understanding the uniqueness of a bagel is that it is probably the stiffest dough in the bread kingdom. Typically, most dough consists of a 55 to 65 percent liquid to flour ratio. Bagels, on the other hand, are usually 50 to 57 percent percent liquid to flour. This stiffness is what allows the dough to tolerate the brutality of boiling without deflating or losing shape. If you try to make a bagel with, say, French bread dough, it will flop around in the water and come out both flat and oblong. The hydration range never can be given as an exact ratio because each brand of flour absorbs liquid differently, and it may even vary within the same brand from batch to batch. So I always advise my students to feel their way into the dough and let it dictate exactly how much liquid or flour it will need in the final adjustment. It is always easier to add extra flour than extra water, especially in stiff dough, so the following instructions suggest gradually stiffening the dough by working in the last bit of flour little by little. The final dough should be stretchy but not tacky, unlike French bread dough, which is tacky to the touch.

Finally, the boiling, or poaching, is another one of those controversial techniques that runs up against family customs. Some people insist on putting either baking soda, salt, sugar, honey, milk, or some combination of them into the water. Many bagel shops use food-grade lye, and many others use absolutely nothing but the water. I've made them all sorts of ways and find that the final result is not as dependent on these add-ins as it is on the time in the water. However, I prefer to use a small amount of baking soda to alkalize the water, as it is readily available and replicates closest the flavor of the lye baths used commercially. The alkalizing of the water causes a slightly different quality of gelatinization of the outer starches on the surface of the dough, inducing more shine and a richer caramelization of the crust when it bakes. It is but a subtle effect, and one that most of the people eating the bagels won't notice. But it may be the final piece of the puzzle to convert the diehards who still insist that there is nothing quite as good as the bagel they remember from the New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, or you fill in the blank, of their youth. I agree with my wife and friends: this is a bagel, a true water bagel, for the ages.

Makes 12 large or 24 mini bagels

**SPONGE**

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

4 cups (18 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

2½ cups (20 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DOUGH**

½ teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast

3¾ cups (17 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

2¾ teaspoons (.7 ounce) salt

2 teaspoons (.33 ounce) malt powder

or 1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) dark or light malt syrup, honey, or brown sugar

**TO FINISH**

1 tablespoon baking soda

Cornmeal or semolina flour for dusting

Sesame seeds, poppy seeds, kosher salt, rehydrated dried minced garlic or onions, or chopped fresh onions that have been tossed in oil (optional)

**1. To make the sponge,** stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop.

**2. To make the dough,** in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining ¾ cup flour to stiffen the dough.

**3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead** for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour—all the ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. If the dough seems too dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems tacky or sticky, add more flour to achieve the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky.

**4. Immediately divide the dough** into 4½-ounce pieces for standard bagels, or smaller if desired. Form the pieces into rolls.

**5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel** and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes.

**6. Line 2 sheet pans** with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with one of the following shaping methods.

**SHAPING BAGELS**

**Method 1:** Poke a hole in a ball of bagel dough and gently rotate your thumb around the inside of the hole to widen it to approximately 2½ inches in diameter. The dough should be as evenly stretched as possible (try to avoid thick and thin spots).

**Method 2:** Roll out the dough into an 8-inch-long rope. (This may require rolling part of the way and resting if the pieces are too elastic and snap back, in which case, allow them to rest for 3 minutes and then extend them again to bring to full length.)

Wrap the dough around the palm and back of your hand, between the thumb and forefinger, overlapping the ends by several inches. Press the overlapping ends on the counter with the palm of your hand, rocking back and forth to seal.

**7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pans.** Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and slip each pan into a food-grade plastic bag, or cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.

**8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded** in the refrigerator by using the "float test." Fill a small bowl with cool or room-temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough.

**9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels),** preheat the oven to 500°F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the pot the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby.

**10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator** and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil for another minute. If you like very chewy bagels, you can extend the boiling to 2 minutes per side. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you decide to replace the paper, be sure to spray the new paper lightly with spray oil to prevent the bagels from sticking to the surface.) If you want to top the bagels, do so as soon as they come out of the water. You can use any of the suggestions in the ingredients list or a combination. I make a seed and salt blend.

**11. When all the bagels have been boiled,** place the pans on the 2 middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 5 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are baking only 1 pan, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven setting to 450°F and continue baking for about 5 minutes, or until the bagels turn light golden brown. You may bake them darker if you prefer.

**12. Remove the pans from the oven** and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving.

COMMENTARY

It is possible to make a sour-dough version of these bagels by replacing the sponge stage with 5 cups (35 ounces) of wild-yeast barm starter and then increasing the instant yeast in the final dough to 1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce). Treat the dough the same as instructed for regular bagels from that point on. The flavor will have the distinctive tang of sourdough bread while retaining the chewy characteristics of a classic bagel. Before making a sourdough version, however, you should first make the version that follows in order to master the technique.

For cinnamon raisin bagels, increase the yeast in the final dough to 1 teaspoon, and add 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon and 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar to the final dough. Rinse 2 cups of loosely packed raisins with warm water to wash off surface sugar, acid, and natural wild yeast. Add the raisins during the final 2 minutes of mixing. Proceed as directed, but do not top the bagels with any garnishes. When they come out of the oven and are still hot, you can brush the tops with melted butter and dip them in cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon-sugar crust, if desired.

##  Brioche and Brioche Relatives

BREAD PROFILE:

Rich, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1 OR 2

_Day 1:_ 20 to 45 minutes sponge; 20 minutes mixing (for Poor Man's Brioche: 3 hours for fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 50 minutes baking)

_Day 2:_ 2½ hours for shaping and proofing; 15 to 50 minutes baking

Brioche is the standard by which all rich breads are judged. In fact, whenever rich breads are described, they are often compared to brioche or called a relative. Brioche is actually simple in character: it is enriched with a small amount of sugar, substantial amounts of egg, and lots of butter—at least in excess of 20 percent (butter to flour ratio) but usually 50 percent or higher. I have rarely seen brioche made commercially with more than 75 percent butter, but I have seen formulas that call for up to 100 percent. There are countless formula variations. Some are made with sponges or other pre-ferments, some by the direct-dough method. Some versions are immediately fermented and then shaped and baked, while some require overnight chilling.

The anecdotal history of this bread includes allusions to Queen Marie Antoinette, whose last words are reputed to be properly translated as "Let them eat brioche," and not "Let them eat cake." There are a lot of reasons to assume that either translation is more myth than fact, but it does beg the question, why would anyone even think to make such a statement? This may be because brioche had two distinct expressions in pre-Revolution France. One version, for the wealthy and thus called rich man's brioche, was loaded with butter (70 percent or more). The other, made for the huddled masses and therefore called poor man's brioche, was butter challenged (20 to 25 percent). As so often happens with bread, it makes a perfect symbol for many things, not the least of which is the class struggle between the haves and the have-nots. So, it would make sense that if the queen was about to lose her head because the revolutionaries were, for the most part, have-nots, why not offer them rich man's brioche. "Yeah, we can do that, sure." But, alas, it was too late, too futile, and probably too arrogant a gesture.

When we examine the formula for rich man's brioche, one thing becomes evident: it has almost the same flour to fat to sugar ratio as pie dough. The main difference is the yeast and eggs. Most pie dough, whether _pâte brisée_ (plain) or _pâte sucrée_ (sweet), and whether flaky or mealy, is made by some variation of what is known as the 1-2-3 method. This means 3 parts flour, 2 parts fat, and 1 part water (and also, in sweet or _sucrée_ pie dough, sugar). The ratio translates as 66.6 percent fat to 100 percent flour. Brioche, rich man's brioche at least, has between 50 and 80 percent butter, right in the pie-dough range. This means that brioche can, in principle, be used to make a very nice tender pie or tart dough, which is often done in French _pâtisseries._ It is a wonderful alternative to the flaky or mealy pie dough under quiche or other custard tarts, as I have witnessed in the _clafouti_ sold in the pastry shop of Paris's Ritz Hotel. Apparently, they make hundreds of these tartlets everyday for their guests and can barely keep up with the demand.

Other applications of brioche include loaf breads for the definitive French toast, tea and café rolls, wraps for meat- or vegetable-filled molds, and, most famously, small fluted rolls with "heads" ( _petites brioches à tête_ ). Beyond that, there are the infinite regional and holiday expressions of the bread, from the Italian _pandoro_ and panettone, to the kugelhopf of Alsace, stollen of Germany and Switzerland, and the amazing meat- and- cheese-filled Italian version called _casatiello._

The following versions of brioche give you three options, depending on the amount of butter you feel ready to tackle. In the spirit of Queen Marie, we will call them rich man's, middle-class, and poor man's brioche, all of which have valid applications in the bread canon.

COMMENTARY

When a formula calls for lots of fat, whether butter, shortening, or oil, it is usually beneficial to wait until the gluten has had an opportunity to develop before adding the fat. If the fat is added at the beginning, it coats the protein fragments (gliadin and glutenin) and makes it difficult for them to bond into the longer, stronger gluten molecule. Wait 5 minutes before incorporating the fat to allow complete hydration to occur. Of course, there are cakelike variations of brioche in which the butter is intentionally added with the flour to create a very tender, tight-crumbed bread, almost like pound cake. If you desire this texture or application, simply add the butter early on and ignore the chill-down step, transferring the batter, with a spoon or spatula, to a greased pan right after the primary fermentation.

To make _brioche à tête,_ you will need a special fluted brioche mold, available at gourmet kitchen shops. These molds come in many sizes, but I find the small 2-ounce molds to be the most functional. The larger molds are nice for special holiday or festive breads like panettone. Remember to increase the baking time to account for the dough size. (All three brioche variations can be made as standard rolls; see shaping techniques discussed previously.)

The Rich Man's Brioche that follows is even richer than the version presented in _Crust & Crumb._ That one was about 70 percent butter to flour; this version is about 88 percent butter to flour. The yeast percentage is thus higher to provide the necessary push, and the sponge is very fast, needing only 20 minutes to develop. It is best mixed in an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, but it can also be mixed by hand with a sturdy spoon and a strong arm.

###  Rich Man's Brioche

Makes 16 to 24 _petites brioches à tête,_ 2 to 4 large _brioches à tête,_ or three 1-pound loaves

**SPONGE**

½ cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1 tablespoon (.33 ounce) instant yeast

½ cup (4 ounces) whole milk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

**DOUGH**

5 large (8.25 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

3½ cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2½ tablespoons (1.25 ounces) granulated sugar

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

2 cups (16 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 egg, whisked until frothy, for egg wash

**1. To make the sponge,** stir together the flour and yeast in a large mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Stir in the milk until all the flour is hydrated. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 20 minutes, or until the sponge rises and then falls when you tap the bowl.

**2. To make the dough,** add the eggs to the sponge and whisk (or beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment) until smooth. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add this mixture to the sponge and eggs and stir (or continue to mix with the paddle on low speed for about 2 minutes) until all the ingredients are hydrated and evenly distributed. Let this mixture rest for 5 minutes so that the gluten can begin to develop. Then, while mixing with a large spoon (or on medium speed with the paddle), gradually work in the butter, about one-quarter at a time, waiting until each addition of butter assimilates before adding more. This will take a few minutes. Continue mixing for about 6 more minutes, or until the dough is very well mixed. You will have to scrape down the bowl from time to time as the dough will cling to it. The dough will be very smooth and soft.

**3. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment** and mist lightly with spray oil. Transfer the dough to the sheet pan, spreading it to form a large, thick rectangle measuring about 6 inches by 8 inches. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the pan with plastic wrap or place it in a large food-grade plastic bag.

**4. Immediately put the pan into the refrigerator** and chill overnight, or for at least 4 hours.

**5. Remove the dough from the refrigerator** and shape it while it is very cold. If it warms up or softens, return it to the refrigerator. If you are making _brioches à tête_ , lightly oil or use spray oil to grease the fluted molds. Divide the dough into 12 to 16 portions for _petites brioches à tête_ and 2 to 4 portions for larger shapes. (The size of each portion should correspond to the size of the molds; _petites brioches à tête_ are typically 1½ to 2 ounces each, while larger versions can range from 1 to 2 pounds. Whatever size you are making, the molds should only be half full with dough to allow for expansion during proofing.) Shape the _petites brioches à tête_ into small balls and the larger ones into _boules_. Proceed with shaping instructions shown below. Place the molds on a sheet pan after final shaping. **If you are making loaves,** grease two 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans. Divide the dough into 3 pieces and shape the dough into loaves.

SHAPING BRIOCHES À TÊTE

**Method 1:** Dust your hands with flour and, using the edge of your hand, divide a ball of dough into a large and small ball by rolling down, but not quite all the way through, the dough.

Place the large ball into the oiled brioche mold and use the tips of your fingers to indent the top and to round and center the smaller ball.

**Method 2:** Roll the dough into a strand that tapers at one end.

Poke a hole in the thick end and loop the tapered end through it so that it pops out and forms a cap. Round the cap into a ball and center it on the larger portion. Place it in the oiled brioche mold.

**6. Mist the top of the dough** with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap, or slip the pan(s) into a food-grade plastic bag. Proof the dough until it nearly fills the molds or loaf pans, 1½ to 2 hours for _petites brioches à tête_ and longer for larger shapes. Gently brush the tops with egg wash. Cover the dough with plastic wrap that has been lightly misted with spray oil. Continue proofing for another 15 to 30 minutes, or until the dough fills the molds or pans.

**7. Preheat the oven to 400°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf for _petites brioches à tête,_ or 350°F for larger shapes.

**8. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes** for _petites brioches à tête_ and 35 to 50 minutes for larger shapes. The internal temperature should register above 180°F for the small ones and about 190°F for the larger shapes. The bread should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom and be golden brown.

**9. Remove the brioches or loaves from the pans** as soon as they come out of the oven and cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes for small brioches and 1 hour for larger shapes before serving.

###  Middle-Class Brioche

Makes 12 to 16 _petites brioches à tête,_ 2 to 4 large _brioches à tête,_ or two 1-pound loaves

**SPONGE**

½ cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

½ cup (4 ounces) whole milk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

**DOUGH**

5 large (8.25 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

**Proceed as described for Rich Man's Brioche,** extending the fermentation for the sponge to 30 to 45 minutes.

COMMENTARY

Middle-Class Brioche, made with a 50 percent butter to flour ratio, is a very versatile dough, perfect for cinnamon or sticky buns, soft loaves, and _brioche à tête._ It is the most common form of brioche because it costs less than Rich Man's Brioche and requires less gymnasium time to work off the butter (though 50 percent fat to flour is still workout worthy!). It is also easier to handle than the richer version.

Makes 12 to 16 _petites brioches à tête,_ 2 to 4 large _brioches à tête,_ or two 1-pound loaves

**SPONGE**

½ cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

½ cup (4 ounces) whole milk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

**DOUGH**

4 large (6.6 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

3¼ cups (14.75 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) granulated sugar

1¼ teaspoons (.31 ounce) salt

½ cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 egg, whisked until frothy, for egg wash

**1. To make the sponge,** stir together the flour and yeast in a large mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Stir in the milk until all the flour is hydrated. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 30 to 45 minutes, or until the sponge rises and then falls when you tap the bowl.

**2. To make the dough,** add the eggs to the sponge and whisk (or beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment) until smooth. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add this mixture to the sponge and eggs and stir (or continue to mix with the paddle on low speed for about 2 minutes) until all the ingredients are hydrated and evenly distributed. Let this mixture rest for 5 minutes so that the gluten can begin to develop. Then, while mixing with a large spoon (or on medium speed with the dough hook), gradually work in the butter, about one-quarter at a time, waiting until each addition of butter assimilates before adding more.

**3. Transfer the dough to the counter** and knead for about 10 minutes, adding small amounts of flour as needed, until the dough is very smooth and soft, but not too sticky to handle (kind of like French bread dough). (Or continue mixing with the dough hook on low speed for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the dough is very well mixed and clears the sides and bottom of the bowl.)

**4. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl.** Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover with plastic wrap. Ferment for about 90 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Proceed with the shaping instructions** described in Rich Man's Brioche, reducing the proofing time to about 1 hour. Bake and cool as directed.

COMMENTARY

Poor Man's Brioche is especially useful for wraps or _en croûte_ applications since it is by far the easiest version to handle. It also makes a very nice _pain de mie,_ or sandwich bread. It is still a rich bread, in excess of 20 percent butter to flour, but lacks the melt-in-your-mouth buttery flake of the richer versions.

Casatiello _and_ petites brioches à tête _(back left)_

##  Casatiello

BREAD PROFILE:

Rich, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

1 hour sponge; 12 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 30 to 60 minutes baking

This is a rich, dreamy Italian elaboration of brioche, loaded with flavor bursts in the form of cheese and bits of meat, preferably salami. Since first reading about it in Carol Field's wonderful _The Italian Baker,_ I've also made it with bacon bits, different types of fresh or cured sausage, and even with nonmeat substitutes. The bread is traditionally baked in paper bags or panettone molds, but it can also be baked in loaf pans. Perhaps the best way to think of it is as a savory version of panettone, with cheese and meat replacing the candied fruit and nuts. Serve it warm and the cheese will still be soft; serve it cool and each slice will taste like a sandwich unto itself.

Makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves

**SPONGE**

½ cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1 tablespoon (.33 ounce) instant yeast

1 cup (8 ounces) whole milk or buttermilk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

**DOUGH**

4 ounces dry-cured Italian salami or other meat (see Commentary)

3½ cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) granulated sugar

2 large (3.3 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

¾ cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature

¾ cup (6 ounces) coarsely shredded or grated provolone or other cheese (see Commentary)

**1. To make the sponge** , stir together the flour and yeast in a bowl. Whisk in the milk to make a pancakelike batter. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 1 hour. The sponge will foam and bubble and should collapse when you tap the bowl.

**2. While the sponge is fermenting,** dice the salami into small cubes and sauté it lightly in a frying pan to crisp it slightly. (Or, cook and crumble the bacon or sauté fresh sausage or salami substitutes until crisp, saving the rendered fat.)

**3. To make the dough,** in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), stir together the flour, salt, and sugar with a spoon. Add the eggs and the sponge and mix together (or mix with a paddle attachment on low speed) until all the ingredients form a coarse ball. If there is any loose flour, dribble in a small amount of water or milk to gather it into the dough. Stir (or mix) for about 1 minute, then let the dough rest for 10 minutes to allow the gluten to develop. Divide the butter into 4 pieces. Begin working the butter into the dough, one piece at a time, stirring vigorously with the spoon (or mixing on medium speed). The dough will be soft but not a batter. Continue mixing with the spoon, or switch to your hands but keep them floured as you knead, working the dough into a smooth, tacky mass. It will take about 12 minutes. (In the electric mixer, scrape down the bowl with a plastic bowl scraper or rubber spatula and then switch to the dough hook after 4 minutes. The dough will change from sticky to tacky and eventually come off the sides of the bowl. If not, sprinkle in more flour until the dough forms a ball and clears the sides of the bowl.)

**4. When the dough is smooth,** add the meat pieces and knead (or mix) until they are evenly distributed. Then gently knead (or mix) in the cheese until it too is evenly distributed. The dough will be soft and stretchy, very tacky but not sticky. If it is sticky, sprinkle in more flour until it firms up. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**5. Ferment at room temperature for about 90 minutes,** or until the dough increases in size by at least 1½ times.

**6. Remove the dough from the bowl** and leave as 1 piece for 1 large loaf or divide into 2 pieces for smaller loaves. The loaves may be baked in white or brown sandwich-sized paper bags set in metal cans just large enough to hold them, such as a no. 10 can or a coffee can. Or they may be baked in 1 large or 2 small loaf pans. (You may also use paper or metal pannetone molds, available at specialty cookware stores, or an 8-inch cake pan, as shown in the recipe image.) **If you are baking in bags,** generously spray the inside of 1 or 2 small brown or white sandwich- or lunch-sized paper bags with spray oil. Lightly dust your hands and the dough with flour and shape the dough (or dough pieces) into a _boule_. Place a ball of dough in the prepared bag, and roll the top of the bag back to make a collar about 2 inches above the top of the dough. Place the bag in a metal can just large enough to hold it. **If you are baking in pans,** mist one 9 by 5-inch or two 8½ by 4½-inch pans with spray oil. Lightly dust your hands and the dough with flour and shape the dough into 1 or 2 loaves, and place in the pans. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and loosely cover the bags or pans with plastic wrap or a towel.

**7. Proof for 60 or 90 minutes,** or until the dough just reaches to the top of the bags or just crests to the top of the pans.

**8. Preheat the oven to 350°F,** setting the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.

**9. Place the cans or pans with the dough in the oven** and bake for 20 minutes, then rotate the pans 180 degrees. If you are baking in cans, reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (do not reduce the oven setting if you are baking in regular bread pans). Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes for bread pans or about 40 minutes for cans, or until the center of the loaves registers 185° to 190°F. The dough will be golden brown on top and on the sides, and the cheese will ooze out into crisp little brown pockets. The bread will rise to just above the top of the bags.

**10. When the bread is done,** remove it from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. If you are baking in bread pans, remove the bread from the pans; if you are baking in bags, remove the bags from the cans and either remove the bread from the bags or cut slits in the bags to allow the stream to escape. Let the bread cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

Other types of cheese can be substituted for the provolone, but the cheese should be a good "melter" with distinctive flavor of its own, such as Swiss, Gouda, or Cheddar or their infinite cousins. I rarely use mozzarella or Jack because they are some-what bland, or Parmesan or other hard cheeses because they are too salty and do not melt into a creamy pocket. However, if that is what I have on hand, blending mozzarella or Jack with a grated hard cheese brings the melting and flavor perks of each together into an excellent substitute.

This is a fast sponge and the entire bread can be made in about 5 hours from start to finish. The dough can also be made a day ahead, and then shaped and baked the following day, like brioche, but you must chill it as soon as it comes off the mixer to avoid overfermenting.

The formula calls for whole milk, but I often substitute buttermilk because I like the slightly acidic flavor.

The meat may be any flavorful substitute that you have on hand or prefer. Italian salami and pepperoni are ideal because the flavor intensifies as they cook, and little bits go a long way, especially if they are lightly sautéed before they are added to the dough. Cooked and crumbled bacon and pancetta are also superb in this bread, and the rendered fat can be added to the dough as a substitute for an equal part of the butter for even more flavor intensity. Other substitutes include crisped chorizo, Italian sausage, or other crisped fresh sausage; fresh all-beef salami (diced and then cooked until slightly crisp); imitation bacon bits (soy); or firm smoked tofu cut into bits.

You can cut the butter in half if you prefer, but you may have to increase the milk slightly to achieve the proper consistency.

##  Challah

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 45 minutes baking, depending on size

Makes 1 large braided loaf, 2 smaller loaves, or 1 large double-braided celebration loaf

Challah, the braided Sabbath bread of Judaism, is a European celebratory loaf symbolic of God's goodness and bounty. The braids traditionally separate the loaf into twelve distinct sections representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The use of eggs in the bread was probably a way to use up excess eggs before the strict Judaic Sabbath day of rest made it impossible to harvest the new eggs, as harvesting is one of many activities considered work in Orthodox Jewish communities.

I've made challah many different ways, but this is a great formula that produces a soft golden loaf, radiant when brought to the table. The key to a beautiful challah, one that stops conversation and holds everyone's attention, is to braid it so that it is tapered at the ends and plump in the middle.

4 cups (18 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) granulated sugar

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

1⅓ teaspoons (.15 ounce) instant yeast

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) vegetable oil

2 large (3.3 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

2 large (1.25 ounces) egg yolks, slightly beaten

¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons to 1⅛ cups (7 to 9 ounces) water, at room temperature

2 egg whites, whisked until frothy, for egg wash

Sesame or poppy seeds for garnish

**1. Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast** in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, eggs and yolks, and ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons water. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture. Mix with a spoon (or on low speed with the paddle attachment) until all the ingredients gather and form a ball. Add the remaining water, if needed.

**2. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and knead for about 10 minutes (or mix at medium-low speed for 6 minutes with the dough hook), sprinkling in more flour if needed to make a soft, supple, but not sticky dough. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register approximately 80°F.

**3. Lightly oil a large bowl.** Form the dough into a _boule_, and transfer into the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Ferment for 1 hour at room temperature.

**4. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead** for 2 minutes to degas. Re-form it into a ball, return the ball to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and ferment for an additional hour. It should be at least 1½ times its original size.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it** into 3 equal pieces for 1 large loaf, or 6 pieces for 2 loaves. (Or, for a celebration challah, divide it into 3 equal pieces and combine 2 of those pieces and form them into 1 large dough. Take this larger piece and divide it into 3 equal pieces. Take the smaller dough and divide it into 3 pieces as well; in the end, you will have 3 large pieces and 3 small pieces.) Regardless of the size of the loaves you decide to make, form each of the pieces into a _boule,_, cover them with a towel, and let them rest on the counter for 10 minutes.

**6. Roll out the pieces into strands,** each the same length, thicker in the middle and slightly tapered toward the ends. Braid them using the 3-braid method. (If making the celebration challah, lay the smaller braid on top of the larger braid, gently pressing the smaller braid onto the larger to adhere.) Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and transfer the loaf or loaves to the pan. Brush the loaves with the egg wash. Mist the loaves with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or place the pan in a food-grade plastic bag.

**7. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 75 minutes,** or until the dough has grown to 1½ times its original size.

**8. Preheat the oven to 350°F** (325°F for the celebration challah) with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Brush again with egg wash and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.

**9. Bake for 20 minutes.** Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking for 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the size of the loaf. The bread should be a rich golden brown and register 190°F in the center.

**10. When done, transfer the bread to a rack** and cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

A double-braided celebration or festival challah is often made for weddings and Bar and Bat Mitzvahs. This double-decker version, with a smaller braid laminated to the top of the larger loaf, makes a very dramatic centerpiece.

One of the people who tested this recipe, Ellen Fenster, reminded me that the braided dough also can be curled into a round loaf, especially for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. The round shape symbolizes that the world has no beginning and no end; the three strands symbolize truth, peace, and beauty; and the spiral coil indicates the ascent to God. It is also customary to sweeten the loaf with additional sugar (you can double it) as a sign of beginning the New Year in a sweet way. Ellen told me that garnishing the loaves with seeds, such as poppy or sesame, symbolizes the falling of manna from heaven, and the covering of the challah with a cloth as it is served at the Sabbath meal represents the heavenly dew that protects the manna. Thank you, Ellen!

This bread, with its big, shiny holes and amorphous shape, has taken America by storm, just as it did Italy during the past fifty years. Though it hails from an age-old tradition of rustic, slack-dough breads, the name _ciabatta_ was not applied to this loaf until the mid-twentieth century by an enterprising baker in the Lake Como region of northern Italy. He observed that the bread resembled a slipper worn by dancers of the region and thus dubbed his loaf _ciabatta di Como_ (slipper bread of Como). A new tradition was born. During the second half of the century, this ciabatta became the unofficial national bread of Italy, so closely identified is it with the chewy, rustic peasant breads of the Italian countryside. As with pugliese bread, the dough is not unlike that of many other Italian and French rustic breads, including pizza and focaccia, and can thus be made into many shapes other than the Lake Como slipper.

You can make this dough with a large amount of either _poolish_ or _biga,_ and formulas for both versions follow. It can also be made with the addition of milk and olive oil to tenderize the dough. In other words, there are many variations, all valid, and as long as you make a slipper shape you can call it ciabatta.

Since writing _Crust & Crumb,_ I have continued to fine-tune these rustic breads, pushing the limits of time and temperature manipulation, trying to evoke every bit of flavor trapped in the flour. In the _pain à l'ancienne_ formula, we will make a similar dough but with no pre-ferment and a long cold fermentation. Each variation in technique brings forth slightly different flavor tones from the wheat, and everyone seems to have their own preferences. In this version, the use of 165 to 180 percent pre-ferment seems to be the magic amount to maximize a same-day bread in a 4- to 5-hour window. It yields a slightly acidic and yeasty edge, a flavor that many people love. They say, "This tastes like real bread!" I have found little difference between the _biga_ and _poolish_ versions; both are amazing.

_This rustic bread dough can be formed into a number of shapes beyond the classic slipper, such as the long _stirato,_ stubby _pain rustique,_ or round pugliese style._

###  Ciabatta, Poolish Version

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 3 smaller loaves

3¼ cups (22.75 ounces) _poolish_

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1¾ teaspoons (.44 ounce) salt

1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce) instant yeast

6 tablespoons to ¾ cup (3 to 6 ounces) water (or substitute milk or buttermilk for all or part of the water, see Commentary), lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the poolish from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.

**2. To make the dough,** stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the _poolish_ and 6 tablespoons of the water. With a large metal spoon (or on low speed with the paddle attachment), mix until the ingredients form a sticky ball. If there is still some loose flour, add the additional water as needed and continue to mix. **If you aremixing by hand,** repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. **If you are using an electric mixer,** mix on medium speed with the paddle attachment for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. Switch to the dough hook for the final 2 minutes of mixing. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. You may need to add additional flour to firm up the dough enough to clear the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still be quite soft and sticky.

**3. Sprinkle enough flour on the counter** to make a bed about 8 inches square. Using a bowl scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and proceed with the stretch-and-fold method shown below. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.

**STRETCH-AND-FOLD METHOD**

Dust the top of the dough liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle. Wait 2 minutes for the dough to relax.

Coat your hands with flour and lift the dough from each end, stretching it to twice its size.

Fold the dough over itself, letter style, to return it to a rectangular shape.

**4. Let rest for 30 minutes.** Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. Allow the covered dough to ferment on the counter for 1½ to 2 hours. It should swell but not necessarily double in size.

**5.Set up a couche**. Carefully remove the plastic from the dough and proceed as shown below in the Shaping Ciabatta sidebar. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and dust the dough with more flour, then cover the cloth with a towel.

SHAPING CIABATTA

Using a pastry scraper that has been dipped in water, divide the dough into 2 or 3 rectangles, taking care not to degas the dough. Sprinkle the dough generously with more flour and, using the scraper to get under the dough, gently lift each piece from the counter and then roll it on both sides in the loose flour to coat.

Lay the loaves on the cloth and gently fold each piece of dough, from left to right, letter style, into an oblong about 6 inches long.

Bunch the cloth between the pieces to provide a wall.

**6. Proof for 45 to 60 minutes** at room temperature, or until the dough has noticeably swelled.

**7.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F.

**8. Generously dust a peel** or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the dough pieces to the peel or pan, using the pastry scraper if you need support. Lift the dough from each end and tug the dough out to a length of 9 to 12 inches. If the dough bulges too high in the middle, gently dimple it down with your fingertips to even out the height of the loaf. Slide the 2 doughs (or bake one at a time if you prefer) onto the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the side walls of the oven with water, and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, turn the oven setting down to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking for 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until done. The bread should register 205°F in the center and should be golden in color (but the flour streaks will also give it a dusty look). The loaves will feel quite hard and crusty at first but will soften as they cool.

**9. Transfer the bread from the oven to a cooling rack** and allow to cool for at least 45 minutes before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

You can add ¼ cup (2 ounces) of olive oil to the formula and/or substitute whole milk or buttermilk for some or all of the water (even the _poolish_ can be made with milk). In either instance, the oil- or milk-enriched product will be softer and more tender than the lean, water-only version. If you are adding the oil, you may need to also add a small amount of flour—as always, let the dough dictate if it needs any flour or liquid adjustments.

As you become comfortable with wet dough, you may want to try increasing the hydration and stickiness of the dough. The wetter the better, as long as it holds together enough to make the stretch-and-fold maneuvers. It is during the stretching and folding that the gluten has a chance to strengthen, resulting in the large holes so distinctive and prized in this bread.

This dough is very simple to make in a food processor.

There are a number of fabulous variations that can be made by adding mushrooms, cheese, and sautéed onions, as described on the following pages.

###  Wild Mushroom Ciabatta (Ciabatta al Funghi)

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 3 smaller loaves

5 dried shiitake or porcini mushrooms, broken into pieces

6 tablespoons water, warm (100°F)

1 pound fresh button or shiitake mushrooms, cut into ¼-inch-thick slices

4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced

¼ cup olive oil

Salt and pepper

Ciabatta, _Poolish_ Version or Ciabatta, _Biga_ Version

**1. Soak the dried mushrooms** in the water for 30 minutes (you can do this just prior to making the final dough or the day before). Meanwhile, sauté the fresh mushrooms and garlic in the olive oil over medium heat just until they are soft. Strain off the pan juices and add them to the soaking dried mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste to the remaining mushrooms, and set them aside to cool.

**2. Make the dough as directed in the master formula,** adding the dried mushrooms and their juice as you mix the dough and using as much liquid as is necessary to make a soft, sticky dough.

**3. Proceed as described in the _poolish_ verson.** When you perform the 2 stretch-and-fold turns, sprinkle one-quarter of the sautéed fresh mushrooms (or less, if you are making 3 smaller loaves) over each piece of dough each time and fold them in. If any fall out, simply add them in the next time or slip them between the folds.

COMMENTARY

Probably the most popular bread among my students is wild mushroom ciabatta. I included an excellent formula for this in _Crust & Crumb,_ but have developed a new technique for making this and other flavored variations using the new formulas in this book. Here are three examples, but there are no limits to the options.

###  Ciabatta with Cheese (Ciabatta al Formaggio)

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 3 smaller loaves

Ciabatta, _Poolish_ Version or Ciabatta, _Biga_ Version

2 cups shredded or grated Parmesan, Romano, mozzarella, Jack, Cheddar, provolone, Swiss, and blue cheese, in any combination

**Make the dough as directed in the master formula.** When performing the 2 stretch-and-fold steps, sprinkle one-quarter of the cheese blend (or less, if you are making 3 smaller loaves) over each piece of dough each time and fold them in. Proceed as described in the _poolish_ version.

###  Caramelized Onion and Herb Ciabatta

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 3 smaller loaves

4 cups sliced onions

¼ cup olive oil

2 tablespoons sugar

1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

1 cup chopped fresh herb blend (any combination of fresh parsley, basil, oregano, tarragon, cilantro, or other favorite herb)

Salt and pepper

Ciabatta, _Poolish_ Version or Ciabatta, _Biga_ Version

**1. Prepare the onion-and-herb mixture** at least 1 hour before making the dough or the day before. In a large pan, sauté the onions in the olive oil over medium heat until they start to caramelize or turn brown (it will take 10 to 15 minutes). Add the sugar and continue to cook until the sugar melts and the onions turn golden brown. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir until the onions are evenly coated. Turn off the heat and add the herbs, tossing just until they are evenly distributed and wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.

**2. Make the dough as directed in the master formula.** When performing the 2 stretch-and-fold steps, spread one-quarter of the onions (or less, if you are making 3 smaller loaves) over each piece of dough each time and fold them in. Proceed as described in the _poolish_ version.

##  Cinnamon Buns and Sticky Buns

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

15 minutes mixing; 3¾ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 50 to 55 minutes baking

My students often ask me to teach them how to make a cinnamon bun as good as the ones they get at the mall from Cinnabon and other franchise shops. For my money, this version makes a cinnamon bun that outperforms all the malls. But those of us who grew up in eastern Pennsylvania have a soft spot in our hearts for sticky buns, such as the ones originating from the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside. Frankly, everyone in the United States seems to have a favorite regional version, whether it is a cinnamon bun glazed with a sweet, white-sugar fondant or a sticky bun with a caramel glaze. Regardless of side issues, such as white versus caramel glazes, the type of nut (usually walnuts versus pecans), or with or without raisins, the real key to this kind of comfort food is a soft, light, tender, slightly sweet dough baked just right.

This formula falls in the enriched, not the rich, dough category because the fat content is slightly under 20 percent. I've made versions of sweet dough that do indeed contain up to 50 percent fat, but then why eat the buns? You might as well strap them right onto your hips, since that's where they will end up (or, as one of my customers used to say, "They call them sticky buns because they stick to your buns!"). Between the shortening, eggs, sugar, and milk, there are plenty of enrichments to tenderize this dough without additional fat. However, if you do want to make a more decadent version of cinnamon or sticky buns, try the formula for Middle-Class Brioche.

Makes 8 to 12 large or 12 to 16 smaller cinnamon or sticky buns or other sweet rolls

6½ tablespoons (3.25 ounces) granulated sugar

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

5½ tablespoons (2.75 ounces) shortening or unsalted butter or margarine, at room temperature

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten

1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) lemon extract

or 1 teaspoon (.1 ounce) grated zest of 1 lemon

3½ cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread or all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

1⅛ to 1¼ cups (9 to 10 ounces) whole milk or buttermilk, at room temperature

or 3 tablespoons (1 ounce) powdered milk (DMS)

and 1 cup (8 ounces) water

½ cup (4 ounces) cinnamon sugar (6½ tablespoons granulated sugar plus 1½ tablespoons ground cinnamon)

White Fondant Glaze for Cinnamon Buns or Caramel Glaze for Sticky Buns

Walnuts, pecans, or other nuts (for sticky buns)

Raisins or other dried fruit, such as dried cranberries or dried cherries (for sticky buns)

**1. Cream together the sugar, salt, and shortening** on medium-high speed in an electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a large metal spoon and mixing bowl and do it by hand); if you are using powdered milk, cream the milk with the sugar, but add the water with the flour and yeast. Whip in the egg and lemon extract until smooth. Then add the flour, yeast, and milk. Mix on low speed (or stir by hand) until the dough forms a ball. Switch to the dough hook and increase the speed to medium, mixing for approximately 10 minutes (or knead by hand for 12 to 15 minutes), or until the dough is silky and supple, tacky but not sticky. You may have to add a little flour or water while mixing to achieve this texture. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**2. Ferment at room temperature** for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.

**3. Mist the counter with spray oil** and transfer the dough to the counter. Proceed as shown below in the Shaping Cinnamon Buns and Sticky Buns sidebar.

SHAPING CINNAMON BUNS AND STICKY BUNS

Roll out the dough with a rolling pin, lightly dusting the top of the dough with flour to keep it from sticking to the pin. Roll it into a rectangle about ⅔ inch thick and 14 inches wide by 12 inches long for larger buns, or 18 inches wide by 9 inches long for smaller buns. Don't roll out the dough too thin, or the finished buns will be tough and chewy rather than soft and plump.

Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the surface of the dough and roll the dough up into a cigar-shaped log, creating a cinnamon-sugar spiral as you roll.

With the seam side down, cut the dough into 8 to 12 even pieces each about 1¾ inches thick for larger buns; or 12 to 16 pieces each 1¼ inch thick for smaller buns.

**4. For cinnamon buns,** line 1 or more sheet pans with baking parchment. Place the buns approximately ½ inch apart so that they aren't touching but are close to one another. **For sticky buns,** coat the bottom of 1 or more baking dishes or baking pans with sides at least 1½ inches high with a ¼-inch layer of the caramel glaze. Sprinkle on the nuts and raisins. You do not need a lot of nuts and raisins, only a sprinkling. Lay the pieces of dough on top of the caramel glaze, spacing them about ½ inch apart. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.

**5. Proof at room temperature for 75 to 90 minutes,** or until the pieces have grown into one another and have nearly doubled in size. You may also retard the shaped buns in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, pulling the pans out of the refrigerator 3 to 4 hours before baking to allow the dough to proof.

**6. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf for cinnamon buns but on the lowest shelf for sticky buns.

**7. Bake the cinnamon buns for** 20 to 30 minutes or the sticky buns for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. If you are baking sticky buns, remember that they are really upside down (regular cinnamon buns are baked right side up), so the heat has to penetrate through the pan and into the glaze to caramelize it. The tops will become the bottoms, so they may appear dark and done, but the real key is whether the underside is fully baked. It takes practice to know just when to pull the buns out of the oven.

**8. For cinnamon buns,** cool the buns in the pan for about 10 minutes and then streak white fondant glaze across the tops while the buns are warm but not too hot. Remove the buns from the pans and place them on a cooling rack. Wait at least 20 minutes before serving. **For sticky buns,** cool the buns in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes and then remove them by flipping them over onto another pan. Carefully scoop any run-off glaze back over the buns with a spatula. Wait at least 20 minutes before serving.

COMMENTARY

This dough can be used for other applications besides cinnamon and sticky buns. For instance, you can make thumbprint sweet rolls, filled with jam or jelly. You can also make pastry logs. Roll out the dough as you would for cinnamon buns, but instead of cutting pinwheel slices and baking them face up, load the logs with nuts, raisins, and cinnamon sugar and bake them whole, like _bâtards._ Slice them after they've cooled so all the goodies inside come tumbling out onto your plate.

GRACE NOTE

White Fondant Glaze for Cinnamon Buns

Cinnamon buns are usually topped with a thick white glaze called fondant. There are many ways to make fondant glaze, but here is a delicious and simple version, enlivened by the addition of citrus flavor, either lemon or orange. You can also substitute vanilla extract or rum extract, or simply make the glaze without any flavorings.

Sift 4 cups of powdered sugar into a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of lemon or orange extract and between 6 tablespoons to ½ cup of warm milk, briskly whisking until all the sugar is dissolved. Add the milk slowly and only as much as is needed to make a thick, smooth paste.

When the buns have cooled but are still warm, streak the glaze over them by dipping the tines of a fork or a whisk into the glaze and waving the fork or whisk over the tops. Or, form the streaks by dipping your fingers in the glaze and letting it drip off as you wave them over the tops of the buns. (Remember to wear latex gloves.)

**Caramel Glaze for Sticky Buns**

Caramel glaze is essentially some combination of sugar and fat, cooked until it caramelizes. The trick is catching it just when the sugar melts and lightly caramelizes to a golden amber. Then it will cool to a soft, creamy caramel. If you wait too long and the glaze turns dark brown, it will cool to a hard, crack-your-teeth consistency. Most sticky bun glazes contain other ingredients to influence flavor and texture, such as corn syrup to keep the sugar from crystallizing and flavor extracts or oils, such as vanilla or lemon. This version makes the best sticky bun glaze of any I've tried. It was developed by my wife, Susan, for Brother Juniper's Café in Forestville, California.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine ½ cup granulated sugar, ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ pound unsalted butter, at room temperature.

Cream together for 2 minutes on high speed with the paddle attachment. Add ½ cup corn syrup and 1 teaspoon lemon, orange, or vanilla extract. Continue to cream for about 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy.

Use as much of this as you need to cover the bottom of the pan with a ¼-inch layer. Refrigerate and save any excess for future use; it will keep for months in a sealed container.

Cinnamon Raisin Walnut Bread with a cinnamon swirl and cinnamon sugar crust

##  Cinnamon Raisin Walnut Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

15 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 40 to 70 minutes baking

In _Brother Juniper's Bread Book,_ I included a recipe for a variation of this bread, but I believe this version is even better, encompassing all the qualities one wants from a raisin bread. It is light, flavorful, loaded with raisins, and it has a wonderful finish, filling your mouth with the satisfying aftertaste of roasted walnuts. If you prefer not to use nuts, eliminate them from the formula without any further changes (you may also substitute other nuts, such as pecans or hazelnuts).

Makes two 1½-pound loaves

3½ cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread flour

4 teaspoons (.66 ounce) granulated sugar

1¼ teaspoon (.31 ounce) salt

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

1¼ teaspoons (.16 ounce) ground cinnamon

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) shortening, melted or at room temperature

½ cup (4 ounces) buttermilk or whole milk, at room temperature

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature

1½ cups (9 ounces) raisins, rinsed and drained

1 cup (4 ounces) chopped walnuts

**1. Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and cinnamon** in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the egg, shortening, buttermilk, and water. Stir together with a large spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients come together and form a ball. Adjust with flour or water if the dough seems too sticky or too dry and stiff.

**2. Sprinkle flour on a counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mixing on medium speed, switching to the dough hook). The dough should be soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. Add flour as you knead (or mix), if necessary, to achieve this texture. Knead by hand for approximately 10 minutes (or by machine for 6 to 8 minutes). Sprinkle in the raisins and walnuts during the final 2 minutes of kneading (or mixing) to distribute them evenly and to avoid crushing them too much. (If you are mixing by machine, you may have to finish kneading by hand to distribute the raisins and walnuts evenly.) The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature** for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.

**4. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces** and form them into loaves. Place each loaf in a lightly oiled 8½ by 4 ½-inch pan, mist the tops with spray oil, and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

**5. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until the dough crests above the lips of the pans and is nearly doubled in size.

**6. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Place the loaf pans on a sheet pan, making sure they are not touching each other.

**7. Bake the loaves for 20 minutes.** Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for another 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the oven. The finished breads should register 190°F in the center and be golden brown on top and lightly golden on the sides and bottom. They should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom.

**8. Immediately remove the breads from their pans** and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

An alternative to the method described here is to add a cinnamon swirl. To make cinnamon sugar, stir together ½ cup granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon. When shaping the dough, roll out each piece with a rolling pin to a rectangle 5 inches wide by 8 inches long and approximately ⅓ inch thick. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the surface of the rectangles and then roll up the dough into a tight sandwich-style loaf, pinching the seam closed with your fingers. When you slice the baked bread, there will be a cinnamon swirl that not only looks pretty, but will also add additional cinnamon-sugar flavor.

Another trick that adds flavor is to brush the tops of the baked loaves with melted butter as soon as they come out of the bread pans, and then roll them in the cinnamon sugar. When the bread cools, the top will have an additional sweet and crunchy flavor burst.

_Corn Bread_

##  Corn Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

_Enriched, batter dough; chemical leavening (baking powder and baking soda)_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 5 minutes cornmeal soaker _Day 2:_ 45 minutes to prepare bacon; 15 minutes mixing and heating the pan; 30 minutes baking

The single most vivid taste memory I associate with Thanksgiving is the flavor of crisp turkey skin. I almost always get first dibs on the wing tips and sneak into the kitchen to peel off the crispiest pieces of golden, salt-and-peppery cracklin's before the carvers go to work. The intensity of flavor means it doesn't take a lot of skins to satisfy my craving, but by the end of the meal, I usually find myself yearning for just one more piece.

This corn bread is designed to take the pressure off that yearning, substituting the smoky, salty flavor of crackly bacon for the turkey skin. However, I often make a variation of this, buying a half-pound of chicken or turkey skins from the butcher, laying them out on a sheet pan, seasoning them with salt and pepper, and baking at 350°F until they render their fat and become very crisp and crumbly, just like bacon.

The use of sugar, honey, buttermilk, lots of corn kernels, and polenta-grind cornmeal (rather than the usual finely ground cornmeal) gives this bread moisture, texture, and sweet yet tart flavor bursts. The bacon (or cracklings) on the top is the final payoff, complementing any Thanksgiving dinner or re-creating Thanksgiving flavor memories throughout the year.

I have an ongoing love affair with good corn bread. By good I mean moist and sweet, with crunch and texture. This recipe is my favorite, and it is the best corn bread I have ever made or eaten. Corn bread falls into the category of quick breads, since it is leavened by baking powder (see information on chemical leavening). Even though this book is not about chemically leavened quick breads, I couldn't resist adding it to the collection because, frankly, I just don't think it gets any better than this.

Makes one 10-inch round bread

1 cup (6 ounces) coarse cornmeal (also packaged as "polenta")

2 cups (16 ounces) buttermilk

8 ounces bacon (approximately 10 slices)

1¾ cups (8 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour

1½ tablespoons (.75 ounce) baking powder

¼ teaspoon (.05 ounce) baking soda

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

¼ cup (2 ounces) granulated sugar

¼ cup (2 ounces) firmly packed brown sugar

3 large (5 ounces) eggs

2 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) honey

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted

2½ cups (16 ounces) fresh or frozen corn kernels

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) bacon fat or vegetable oil

**1. The night before baking the corn bread,** soak the cornmeal in the buttermilk. Cover and leave at room temperature overnight.

**2. The next day, to prepare the bacon,** preheat the oven to 375°F. Lay out the bacon on 2 sheet pans. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the bacon is crisp. Using tongs or a fork, remove the pieces to a pan lined with paper towels to cool. Drain off the fat into a can or stainless-steel bowl and save for greasing the corn bread pan. When the bacon has cooled, crumble it into coarse pieces.

**3. Lower the oven setting to 350°F.** Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar. In another bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Dissolve the honey in the melted butter and then stir the warm honey-butter mixture into the eggs. Add this to the soaked cornmeal mixture. Add the wet mixture to the flour mixture and stir with a large spoon or whisk until all the ingredients are evenly distributed and the batter is blended and smooth. It should be the consistency of thick pancake batter. Stir in the corn kernels until they are evenly distributed.

**4. Place 2 tablespoons of the rendered bacon fat** into a 10-inch round cake pan (you can also use a 9 by 13-inch baking pan or a 12-inch square pan). Place the pan in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the fat gets very hot. With good pot holders or oven mitts, remove the pan, tilt it to grease all the corners and sides, and pour in the batter, spreading it from the center of the pan to the edges. Sprinkle the crumbled bacon pieces evenly over the top, gently pressing them into the batter.

**5. Bake for about 30 minutes,** or until the corn bread is firm and springy (the baking time will depend on the size of the pan) and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The top will be a medium golden brown. The internal temperature at the center of the corn bread should register at least 185°F.

**6. Allow the bread to cool in the pan** for at least 15 minutes before slicing it into squares or wedges. Serve warm.

COMMENTARY

As with all quick breads, this batter can be used to make muffins. Fill the greased muffin cups to the top and bake at 350°F for about 30 minutes, or until the center of a muffin is springy and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Cranberry Walnut Celebration Bread

##  Cranberry-Walnut Celebration Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 25 minutes cooking and baking

I've long believed that the connecting link in any Thanksgiving dinner is the cranberry relish. It ties all the other flavors together, its juices running in all directions on the plate, blending with the gravy, potatoes, and the dressing, and finally, enlivening the turkey itself with its sweet-and-sour flavor tones. Of course, it has to be good cranberry relish, with coarsely chopped berries, walnuts, and orange juice, not just the canned jelly slices. This bread captures those flavors and can be used to supplement the relish (which always seems to run out before I've had my fill). It also makes a beautiful table presentation, with its double-decker braiding, evocative of a traditional celebration challah.

Makes 1 large braided loaf

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached bread flour

3 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) granulated sugar

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

3½ teaspoons (.39 ounce) instant yeast

1½ tablespoons (.75 ounce) orange or lemon extract

2 large (3.3 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten

½ cup (4 ounces) buttermilk or any kind of milk, at room temperature

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, melted

¼ to ½ cup (2 to 4 ounces) water, at room temperature

1½ cups (9 ounces) dried sweetened cranberries

¾ cup (3 ounces) coarsely chopped walnuts

1 egg, whisked until frothy, for egg wash

**1. Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast** in a large mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the orange extract, eggs, buttermilk, and butter. Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), slowly adding just enough water to make a soft, pliable ball of dough.

**2. Sprinkle flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook) for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and only slightly tacky, but not sticky. It should have a soft, pliable quality, not stiff and resistant. If it is too stiff, knead (or mix) in small amounts of water until it softens; if the dough seems too sticky, sprinkle in small amounts of flour as needed. Add the dried cranberries and knead (or mix) for another 2 minutes, or until they are evenly distributed. Then gently knead (or mix) in the walnut pieces until they are evenly distributed. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature** for about 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size.

**4. Transfer the dough to the counter** and divide it into 6 pieces, 3 pieces of 10 ounces each and 3 pieces of 4 ounces each. Roll out the larger pieces into strands about 9 inches long, thicker in the middle and slightly tapered toward the ends. Roll the smaller pieces into strands about 7 inches long and similarly tapered. Braid the large strands using the 3-braid technique, and then braid the small strands in the same pattern. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment. Place the large braid on the pan. Then center the smaller braid on top in double-decker fashion. Brush the entire assembly with half of the egg wash and refrigerate the remaining egg wash to be used later.

**5. Proof uncovered at room temperature** for about 90 minutes, or until the dough nearly doubles in size. Brush the loaf a second time with the remaining egg wash.

**6. Preheat the oven to 325°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**7. Bake for approximately 25 minutes.** Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and then continue baking for another 25 to 30 minutes, or until the loaf is a deep golden brown, feels very firm, and sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom. The internal temperature at the center of the loaf should register between 185° and 190°F.

**8. Remove the bread from the pan** and transfer it to a cooling rack. Allow the bread to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

There are a lot of dried cranberries and walnuts in this bread, which makes it seem difficult to incorporate them evenly, but they will all fit with patient kneading. Don't worry if some fall out during the shaping stage (just put them back in the dough) or during baking (discard the burned ones).

You can freely substitute raisins or other dried fruits for the cranberries, and pecans and other nuts for the walnuts, but I think the cranberry and walnut combination is a classic!

This dough can also be baked in regular loaf pans or as freestanding _boules_ or _bâtards._ Sweetened, enriched breads such as this one should always be baked in the lower temperature range of 325° to 350°F, regardless of the shape, in order to avoid burning the outside of the loaf before the inside sufficiently gelatinizes.

##  English Muffins

These are fun to make, especially with kids. Instead of baking the bread in the oven, the muffins are baked in a skillet or on a griddle. If you want to get the big holes that the professionals get, you will need to work with a soft, but not sticky, dough and bake or grill the muffins at just the right time, catching them on the rise. The dough, a fairly straightforward enriched dough, can also be used to make English muffin loaf bread, a holey white bread that kids—well, not just kids—love.

Makes 6 English muffins or one 1-pound loaf

2¼ cups (10 ounces) unbleached bread flour

½ tablespoon (.25 ounce) granulated sugar

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

1¼ teaspoons (.14 ounce) instant yeast

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) shortening or unsalted butter, at room temperature

¾ to 1 cup (6 to 8 ounces) milk or buttermilk, at room temperature

Cornmeal for dusting

**1. Stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast** in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Stir in (or mix in on low speed with the paddle attachment) the shortening and ¾ cup milk until the ingredients form a ball. If there is still loose flour in the bowl, dribble in some of the remaining ¼ cup milk. The dough should be soft and pliable, not stiff.

**2. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mixing on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead the dough for about 10 minutes (or mix for about 8 minutes), sprinkling in more flour if needed to make a tacky, but not sticky, dough. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**4. Wipe the counter with a damp cloth** and transfer the dough to the counter. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces of 3 ounces each (or shape into a loaf, and proceed as for white bread). Shape the pieces into _boules_. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment, mist the parchment lightly with spray oil, and dust with cornmeal. Transfer the balls of dough to the sheet pan, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Mist them lightly with spray oil, sprinkle them loosely with cornmeal, and cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap or a towel.

**5. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until the pieces nearly double in size and swell both up and out.

**6. Heat a skillet or flat griddle to medium** (350°F if you have a thermometer setting). Also, preheat the oven to 350°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**7. Brush the pan or griddle with vegetable oil or mist with spray oil.** Uncover the muffin rounds and gently transfer them to the pan, sliding a metal spatula under them and lifting them to the pan. Fill the pan so that the pieces are at least 1 inch apart, not touching. Cover the pieces still on the sheet pan with the plastic wrap or a towel to prevent them from developing a skin. The dough that is being cooked will flatten in the pan and spread slightly, then the pieces will puff somewhat. Cook them for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the bottom of the dough cannot cook any longer without burning. The bottoms should be a rich golden brown; they will brown quickly but will not burn for awhile, so resist the temptation to turn them prematurely or they will fall when you flip them over. Carefully flip the pieces over with the metal spatula and cook on the other side for 5 to 8 minutes in the same manner. Both sides will now be flat. When the dough seems as if it cannot endure any further cooking without burning, transfer the pieces to a sheet pan and place the pan in the oven (don't wait for the still uncooked pieces, or the ones just out of the pan will cool down and will not respond to the oven stage). Bake for 5 to 8 minutes on the middle shelf in the oven to ensure that the center is baked. Meanwhile, return to the uncooked pieces and cook them, then bake them, as you did the first round.

**8. Transfer the baked muffins to a cooling rack** and cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

Instead of cutting open the finished muffins with a knife, use a fork. The commercial brands like to trumpet this as "fork-split" English muffins. The advantage is that by running the tines of the fork into and around the edge of the bread, the famous nooks and crevices that are so much a part of the English muffin mystique are created.

_Focaccia_

##  Focaccia

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, rustic dough; flat; direct or indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 15 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation and panning ( _Poolish_ Focaccia: 3 to 4 hours _poolish_ )

_Day 2:_ 3 hours fermentation; 20 to 30 minutes baking ( _Poolish_ Focaccia: 1 hour to de-chill _poolish_ ; 15 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, panning, and proofing; 20 to 30 minutes baking)

The quality of most American focaccia is so poor that I'm surprised it has caught on as it has, being listed by a top food magazine as one of the hot food trends of the new millennium. Its survival and emergence is probably due to the few bakeries that really do it well, showcasing the honeycombed crumb that results from a properly executed rustic dough. Toppings, no matter how creative and flavorful, can never cover for an inadequate crust. This is true for pizza as well as its Ligurian cousin, focaccia. The main difference between them is that true pizza (Neapolitan) has a thin crust, while authentic focaccia has a thicker crust, but not obnoxiously thick as seen in some American renditions. I prefer a thickness of 1 to 1¼ inches, with big, open, translucent holes, like a ciabatta or pugliese. There is really only one way to achieve such perfection, and that is through long fermentation by either generous use of pre-fermented dough or by retarding the fermentation process through refrigeration. Either method will get you there, so I offer you two formulas. The results are comparable and demonstrate the possibilities presented by time and temperature manipulation. Following the formulas are some suggestions for variations and toppings.

Makes one 17 by 12-inch focaccia

5 cups (22.5 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

2 teaspoons (.5 ounce) salt

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

6 tablespoons (3 ounces) olive oil

2 cups (16 ounces) water, at room temperature

¼ to ½ cup Herb Oil

**1. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast** in a large mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the oil and water and mix with a large metal spoon until all the ingredients form a wet, sticky ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment). **If you aremixing by hand,** repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. **If you are using an electric mixer,** switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. You may need to add additional flour to firm up the dough enough to clear the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still be quite soft and sticky.

**2. Sprinkle enough flour on the counter** to make a bed about 6 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and dust liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle. Wait 5 minutes for the dough to relax.

**3. Coat your hands with flour and stretch the dough** from each end to twice its size. Fold it, letter style, over itself to return it to a rectangular shape. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap.

**4. Let rest for 30 minutes.** Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. After 30 minutes, repeat this one more time.

**5. Allow the covered dough to ferment** on the counter for 1 hour. It should swell but not necessarily double in size.

**6. Line a 17 by 12-inch sheet pan** with baking parchment and proceed with the shaping and panning instructions below.

SHAPING FOCACCIA

Drizzle ¼ cup olive oil over the paper, and spread it with your hands or a brush to cover the surface. Lightly oil your hands and, using a plastic or metal pastry scraper, lift the dough off the counter and transfer it to the sheet pan, maintaining the rectangular shape as much as possible.

Spoon half of the herb oil over the dough.

Use your fingertips to dimple the dough and spread it to fill the pan simultaneously. Do not use the flat of your hands—only the fingertips—to avoid tearing or ripping the dough. Try to keep the thickness as uniform as possible across the surface. Dimpling allows you to degas only part of the dough while preserving gas in the non-dimpled sections. If the dough becomes too springy, let it rest for about 15 minutes and then continue dimpling. Don't worry if you are unable to fill the pan 100 percent, especially the corners. As the dough relaxes and proofs, it will spread out naturally. Use more herb oil as needed to ensure that the entire surface is coated with oil.

**7. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap** (or place the pan inside a food-grade plastic bag). Refrigerate the dough overnight (or for up to 3 days).

**8. Remove the pan from the refrigerator 3 hours before baking.** Drizzle additional herb oil over the surface and dimple it in. (You can use all of it if you want; the dough will absorb it even though it looks like a lot.) This should allow you to fill the pan completely with the dough to a thickness of about ½ inch. Add any other pre-proof toppings desired. Again, cover the pan with plastic and proof the dough at room temperature for 3 hours, or until the dough doubles in size, rising to a thickness of nearly 1 inch.

**9. Preheat the oven to 500°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Gently place any pre-bake toppings on the dough.

**10. Place the pan in the oven.** Lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking the focaccia for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it begins to turn a light golden brown. If you are using any during-bake toppings, sprinkle them on at this point and continue baking an additional 5 minutes or so. The internal temperature of the dough should register above 200°F (measured in the center), and the cheese, if using, should melt but not burn.

**11. Remove the pan from the oven** and immediately transfer the focaccia out of the pan onto a cooling rack. If the parchment is stuck on the bottom, carefully remove it by lifting the corner of the focaccia and peeling if off the bottom with a gentle tug.

**12. Allow the focaccia to cool for at least 20 minutes** before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

This dough makes great pizza as well as focaccia, but it is a little too slack for _stromboli,_ or rolled and stuffed pizza. A popular hybrid is what can best be called pizza-style focaccia, small round pies that begin as pizzas but are allowed to proof and puff up and are then topped with intensely flavored toppings, rather than the customary cheese and sauce toppings of pizza. See examples. The beauty of these, aside from their sheer eye appeal, is that they can be made ahead and served cold or lightly reheated.

Like most rustic dough, with hydration in excess of 70 percent, food-processor mixing is a valid and excellent alternative to that described here. See How to Mix in a Food Processor for instructions on using a food processor.

It will seem as though you are using way too much herb oil, but the dough will absorb it all as it bakes. However, if the amount seems a little excessive for your diet, feel free to cut back on how much you apply during the final dimpling stage.

One of my favorite variations is raisin focaccia (there is a strong tradition of sweet, or breakfast-style, focaccia in Liguria). To make this, omit the herb oil but add 3 cups or more of raisins during the final 2 minutes of mixing (the more the better—the dough should be dense with them). Use regular olive oil on top in place of the herb oil, dust lightly with kosher salt or coarse AA (sanding) sugar before baking, and prepare yourself for the best raisin bread you have ever had!

Some people prefer a crustier, chewier finished product. To accomplish this, reduce the oven temperature to 400°F and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer.

GRACE NOTE   Herb Oil

The generous application of herb oil to focaccia will enhance the flavor of the dough more than any toppings. There are many ways to make this oil, and you can make it in any quantity. I try to always keep some on hand for cooking and dipping. You can use either dried or fresh herbs, or a combination. Do not heat the oil, just warm it, and then let the herbs steep in the warm oil, infusing it with their wonderful flavors.

Here's one way to make it, but feel free to substitute your favorite herbs and spices. The olive oil you use does not have to be extra virgin because it will be cooked later, and the subtle flavor of extra virgin, for which you pay so much, will be lost.

Warm 2 cups olive oil to about 100°F. Add 1 cup chopped fresh herbs. The herbs may include basil, parsley, oregano, tarragon, rosemary, thyme, cilantro, savory, and sage, in any combination. I recommend lots of fresh basil. (Substitute ⅓ cup dried herbs or a blend such as _herbes de Provence,_ or use a combination of fresh and dried herbs.) Add 1 tablespoon coarse or kosher salt, 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, and 1 tablespoon granulated garlic or 5 to 6 cloves fresh garlic, chopped or pressed. You may also add 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon onion powder, or 1 tablespoon dried minced onions. Store any leftover herb oil in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

###  Poolish Focaccia

Makes one 17 by 12-inch focaccia

3 cups (20 ounces) _poolish_

2⅔ cups (12 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

2 teaspoons (.5 ounce) salt

1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce) instant yeast

6 tablespoons (3 ounces) olive oil

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

¼ to ½ cup Herb Oil

**1. Remove the _poolish_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the oil, _poolish,_ and water and mix with a large metal spoon until the ingredients form a wet, sticky ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment). **If you aremixing by hand,** repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon in cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. **If you are using an electric mixer,** switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. You may need to add additional flour to firm up the dough enough to clear the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still be quite soft and sticky.

**3. Sprinkle enough flour on the counter** to make a bed about 6 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the sticky dough to the bed of flour and dust liberally with flour, patting the dough into a rectangle. Wait 5 minutes for the dough to relax.

**4. Coat your hands with flour and stretch the dough** from each end to twice its size and fold it, letter style, over itself to return it to a rectangular shape. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap.

**5. Let rest for 30 minutes.** Stretch and fold the dough again; mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. After 30 minutes, repeat this one more time.

**6. Allow the covered dough to ferment on the counter for 1 hour.** It should swell but not necessarily double in size.

**7. Line a 17 by 12-inch sheet pan** with baking parchment and proceed with the foccacia shaping and panning instructions, adding any pre-proof toppings at this time.

**8. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap.** Proof at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until the dough fills the pan.

**9. About 15 minutes before baking, drizzle on more herb oil,** if desired (you can use all of it; the dough will absorb it even though it seems like a lot), and dimple it in, as well as any pre-bake toppings . This should allow you to fill the pan completely with the dough to a thickness of about ½ inch. Let the dough relax for 15 to 30 minutes before baking to allow the gas to build back up. It will rise to almost 1 inch in thickness.

**10. Preheat the oven to 500°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Place the pan in the oven and lower the oven setting to 450°F. Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the dough begins to turn a light golden brown. If using any during-bake toppings, sprinkle them on at this point and continue baking for an additional 5 minutes or so. The internal temperature of the dough should register above 200°F (measured in the center) and the cheese, if using, should melt but not burn.

**11. Remove the pan from the oven** and immediately transfer the focaccia out of the pan onto a cooling rack. If the parchment is still stuck on the bottom, carefully remove it by lifting the corner of the focaccia and peeling if off the bottom with a gentle tug. Allow the focaccia to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing or serving.

###  Pizza-Style Focaccia

Makes 4 to 6 small focaccia

**1. To make these beautiful pizza breads,** follow the instructions for making Focaccia or _Poolish_ Focaccia, through the stretch-and-fold and bulk fermentation stages. Transfer the dough to a bed of flour and sprinkle flour over the top. Divide the dough into 4 pieces of 10 ounces each or 6 smaller pieces. Toss the pieces in a bed of flour to coat them and gently round them into loose balls, degassing as little as possible. Mist the inside of 4 (or 6) plastic bags with spray oil and also mist the dough balls with spray oil. Place 1 piece in each bag, seal closed with a twist tie, and refrigerate overnight or for up to 3 days (you may also freeze the dough for up to 3 months).

**2. Remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator** 3 hours before baking. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of flour on the counter for each ball and transfer each piece of dough onto the flour. Sprinkle a little more flour over the dough and gently press the dough with your fingertips (not your palms) into a disk 9 to 10 inches in diameter. If the dough is too springy to extend to this diameter, mist it with spray oil, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 15 minutes, then press it to the full size.

**3. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment** and mist the parchment with spray oil. Sprinkle a small amount of cornmeal or semolina flour over the parchment and transfer the dough to the pan (you should be able to fit 2 rounds per pan). Rub some of the herb oil over the top and press into the center of the dough any pre-proof toppings you plan to use (opposite). Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap.

**4. Proof for 2 to 3 hours,** or until the dough rises to about 1½ times its original size.

**5. Preheat the oven to 550°F** or as high as it allows, up to 600°F. Place any pre-bake toppings (opposite) on the dough at this point.

**6. Transfer each pizza-style focaccia, parchment and all,** to a peel or to the back of a sheet pan. (If you are using a baking stone and it will only accommodate 1 pizza at a time, you can cut the parchment with scissors and transfer 1 pizza at a time, saving the others for a later bake or refrigerating for another time.) Slide the focaccia onto the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges of the dough are golden brown and the bottom is also caramelized to a light golden brown. You may remove the parchment after about 5 minutes by sliding it out from under the dough. Baking time will vary according to oven types, and you may need to rotate the focaccia 180 degrees to ensure even baking.

**7. Transfer the focaccia to a cooling rack.** Cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing or serving. Remember to brush any flour or cornmeal off the baking stone before attempting a second bake.

GRACE NOTE   Toppings for Focaccia

I have designated three types of toppings. Those that go on before proofing the dough (pre-proof), those that go on just before baking (pre-bake), and those that go on while the focaccia is baking (during-bake), usually in the last few minutes. Some toppings, such as sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and nuts, need to be surrounded by dough to protect them from burning and from falling off. Other ingredients are not so vulnerable and will stay on the dough without having it proof around it, including moist cheeses, like blue, or strips of meat, which should not sit out during proofing. The during-bake ingredients are usually various cheeses that would otherwise burn, such as grating cheeses.

Here is a sample list of topping ideas for your focaccia. If you have other ideas for toppings, match them to the category and place them on at the appropriate time.

PRE-PROOF TOPPINGS:

Marinated sun-dried tomatoes; olives; roasted garlic; fresh herbs; walnuts, pine nuts, or other nuts; and sautéed mushrooms, red or green peppers, or onions.

PRE-BAKE TOPPINGS:

High-moisture cheeses, such as blue cheese, fresh mozzarella, and feta cheese, and cooked ground meat or meat strips. Also coarse salt or sugar.

DURING-BAKE TOPPINGS:

Dry or semihard cheeses, such as Parmesan, Romano, regular mozzarella, Jack, Cheddar, and Swiss.

_French Bread_

##  French Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Lean, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 1¼ hours _pâte fermentée_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _pâte fermentée;_ 10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 to 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 40 minutes baking

In every book I've written there is a version of French bread, each attempting to close the gap between professional, artisan, and home-baked loaves. This is the best version yet and the closest, I believe, to the breads you will find at your favorite bakery. The key, as in many of these formulas, is the use of a large amount of pre-fermented dough, _pâte fermentée._

My best previous version required holding the shaped loaves overnight in the refrigerator, a technique that still may be applied to improve many lean, slow-rising breads. But purists object because the technique causes blisters, sometimes called bird's-eyes, on the crust (due to carbon dioxide trapped just beneath the skin during the cold retarding stage). While I like that look, as do many consumers, it is not the way baguettes look at French _boulangeries,_ nor most bakeshops anywhere.

This new method allows you to make a full-flavored French bread, from start to finish in 4 to 5 hours (assuming you have the _pâte fermentée_ made in advance). The pre-fermented dough gives the final dough the qualities of one that has been fermented for 7 to 9 hours, the standard of many professional operations. The crust will have a rich, reddish-gold caramelization rather than the more typical yellow-gold color of younger dough. This richer color is a result of sugars released from the starches during fermentation. The bread also exhibits a sweetness that seems as if it must be from added sugar, but all the sugar in this bread is released from within the flour, broken free of the complex starch molecules by amylase and diastase enzymes during fermentation. As with most hearth breads, another key to the success of this bread is handling it gently, retaining as much gas as possible during shaping in order to promote large, irregular holes in the crumb that, again, release maximum flavor. This large, open crumb is one of the signs of a properly handled artisan loaf.

Makes 3 small baguettes (or experiment with other shapes and sizes)

3 cups (16 ounces) _pâte fermentée_

1¼ cups (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour

1¼ cups (5 ounces) unbleached bread flour

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

½ teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast

¾ cup to ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons (6 to 7 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the _pâte fermentée_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flours, salt, yeast,** and _pâte fermentée_ pieces in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water, according to need, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier by adding more flour during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.)

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for about 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky, and all the pre-ferment is evenly distributed. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. If the dough seems properly developed but is still cooler than 77°F, you can knead a few minutes longer to raise the temperature or simply allow a lengthier first rise. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size. If the dough doubles in size before 2 hours have elapsed, knead it lightly to degas and let it rise again, covered, until it doubles from the original size.

**5. Gently remove the dough from the bowl** and transfer it to a lightly floured counter. For baguettes, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Again, take care to degas the dough as little as possible. Form the pieces into baguettes (or whatever shape you prefer). Prepare them for proofing, using either the _couche_ technique or parchment.

**6. Proof at room temperature for 45 to 75 minutes,** or until the loaves have grown to about 1½ times their original size. They should be slightly springy when poked with a finger.

**7.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Score the baguettes.

**8. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the baguettes to the peel or pan. Transfer the baguettes to the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the oven door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking until the loaves are a rich golden brown and register at least 205°F at their center. This can take anywhere from 10 to 20 additional minutes, depending on your oven and how thin your baguettes are. If they seem to be getting too dark but are not hot enough internally, lower the oven setting to 350°F (or turn it off) and continue baking for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.

**9. Remove the loaves from the oven and cool on a rack** for at least 40 minutes before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

You can use only bread flour or only all-purpose flour if you choose, but I find a 50-50 blend results in a bread that has plenty of structure but is still tender, with a nice crackle to the crust.

Look carefully and you will notice that the amount of pre-fermented dough is equal to the amount of new dough. In other words, make the recipe once, hold it overnight to develop flavor and sugar breakout, and then make it again using the first dough as the pre-ferment. This means that the pre-ferment represents 160 percent of the formula in the baker's math system, a very large amount since most bakeries rarely use more than 50 percent pre-ferment. But this is the key to making a bakery-quality baguette at home, as you will see.

If your flour is organic and does not contain malted barley flour, you should add 1 teaspoon of diastatic barley malt powder to the flour blend. This malt powder will accelerate enzyme activity in the dough, resulting in a more colorful crust. You can purchase it through King Arthur Flour.

##  Italian Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

**_Day 1:_ 3 to 4 hours _biga_**

**_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _biga;_ 12 to 15 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 30 minutes baking**

In America, the term _Italian bread_ has come to mean a loaf very similar to French bread, only usually a little softer. This has very little to do with reality, however, since scores of authentic Italian breads exist.

What made the old-time Italian bakeries that were once a part of many American towns and cities special was that the bread was baked fresh daily and bought right at the shop. Today, even with the current bread revolution, much of the bread produced does not stand up to the those old Italian loaves, despite the love, care, and wonderful wood- or coal-fired ovens that we may associate with many contemporary bakeries. This is because many bakeries, smitten with innovative modern ingredients that accelerate fermentation in order to save time and increase profits, have reverted to fast-rising methods that leave much of the potential flavor and color trapped in the starches. The Italian _biga_ pre-ferment method is a step in the direction of improving these breads, much as _pâte fermentée_ and _poolish_ does for French bread.

The following formula pushes the _biga_ method to its limits, and the result is an Italian bread as good as or better than any I've had in recent years. The use of a large amount of _biga_ insures maximum sugar breakout from starches, evoking a sweetness that is far beyond the small amount of sugar in the formula. The finished bread will be slightly softer than French bread and less crusty.

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 9 torpedo (hoagie) rolls

3½ cups (18 ounces) _biga_

2½ cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1⅔ teaspoons (.41 ounce) salt

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) sugar

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) diastatic barley malt powder (optional)

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) olive oil, vegetable oil, or shortening

¾ cup to ¾ cup plus (7 to 8 ounces) water (or milk if making torpedo rolls),

2 tablespoons lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the _biga_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and malt powder** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _biga_ pieces, olive oil, and ¾ cup water and stir together (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until a ball forms, adjusting the water or flour according to need. The dough should be slightly sticky and soft, but not batterlike or very sticky. If the dough feels tough and stiff, add more water to soften (it is better to have the dough too soft than too stiff at this point).

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mixing on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead (or mix) for about 10 minutes, adding flour as needed, until the dough is tacky, but not sticky, and supple. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Gently divide the dough into 2 equal pieces** of about 18 ounces each, or into 9 pieces of about 4 ounces each (for torpedo rolls). Carefully form the pieces into _bâtards_, or rolls, degassing the dough as little possible. Lightly dust with a sprinkle of flour, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let rest for 5 minutes _._ Then complete the shaping, extending the loaves to about 12 inches in length or shaping the torpedo rolls. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and dust with semolina flour or cornmeal. Place the loaves on the pan and lightly mist with spray oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap.

**6. Proof at room temperature for about 1 hour,** or until the loaves or rolls have grown to about 1½ times their original size.

**7.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Score the breads with 2 parallel, diagonal slashes or 1 long slash.

**8. Rolls can be baked directly on the sheet pan. For loaves,** generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the loaves to the peel or pan. Transfer the dough to the baking stone (or bake on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the walls of the oven with water and close the door. Repeat once more after another 30 seconds. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F (or 400°F, see Commentary) and bake until done, rotating 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. It should take about 20 minutes for loaves and 15 minutes for rolls. The loaves and rolls should be golden brown and register at least 200°F at the center.

**9. Transfer the rolls or loaves to a cooling rack** and cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

If you prefer a crustier loaf, lower the oven temperature to 400°F after the steaming and increase the baking time. This will thicken the crust and give it more crunch.

The use of diastatic barley malt powder produces better color because it will accelerate the enzyme activity and thus promote sugar breakout from the starch. You can also use nondiastatic barley malt syrup, which will contribute flavor more than color, or make this bread without any malt, since there is some malt already added to most brands of bread flour (the pre-ferment will contribute some enzymes of its own). Both powder and syrup can be purchased through King Arthur Flour.

GRACE NOTE   Breadsticks: Grissini and Others

Breadsticks never go out of favor and may be peaking at an all-time popularity. I have seen sophisticated equipment designed for nothing else but making hundreds of thousands of breadsticks each day: long, thin ones; short, stubby ones; soft ones; or crisp ones. _Grissini,_ originating in Turin and the Piedmont region of Italy, have become synonymous with crisp, thin Italian breadsticks, much as _ciabatta_ has become generic for rustic bread (there is also a thicker, softer type of breadstick called _francesina.)_ But breadsticks are international in scope and, frankly, can be made from pretty much any bread dough. The question is, do you want them soft or crisp, long or short?

For soft breadsticks, you can use any of the white bread formulas, the kaiser formula, or English muffin dough. Also, French, Vienna, or Italian bread, baked hot and fast, makes fine breadsticks. For crisp sticks, use bagel dough, lavash dough, or Italian bread dough. To drive off the moisture for crisp breadsticks, bake them for a long time at low temperatures, 325° to 350°F, until dry and crisp. For soft breadsticks, bake hotter, at 400° to 425°F, until the sticks turn golden brown, then immediately remove them from the oven. They soften as they cool.

There are two ways to shape breadsticks. One is to roll out each individual stick, rolling them like strands to the desired length, laying them out on a pan, proofing, and then baking. This is great when you want each stick to be unique and distinctive, but it is time-consuming to make a lot of them. When making a large quantity of bread sticks, I've had great success with the following method.

SHAPING BREADSTICKS

Roll out the dough to the desired thickness, and then cut off individual sticks with a pizza cutter (rolling blade).

To seed the breadsticks, you can either roll each unbaked breadstick on a wet towel and then in a bed of seeds, which is great for total seed immersion, or, you can brush or mist the pan of breadsticks with water and then sprinkle the seeds over the top just before baking them. Sesame or poppy seeds are the most commonly used, but I like a blend of those with a sprinkling of sea salt, paprika, and granulated garlic (or garlic salt), with a touch of coarsely ground black pepper.

You can also add fennel, caraway, cumin, or aniseeds, but they are intense and a few seeds go a long way. These "everything" toppings are becoming more and more popular on bagels, cracker breads, and now on those ubiquitous, addictive breadsticks turning up in bread baskets all over the world. You can then either lay the sticks out on a baking parchment–lined sheet pan or individually stretch them further before laying them out, rolling them into swizzle twists, ovals, or curling them into distinctive shapes.

_Kaiser Rolls_

##  Kaiser Rolls

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 1 ¼ hours _pâte fermentée_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _pâte fermentée;_ 10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3½ to 4 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 30 minutes baking

These are sometimes called by different names, such as New York hard rolls, bulkies, or even Vienna rolls. But the distinguishing characteristic of a kaiser roll is the star pattern on the top and a thin, slightly crisp crust that yields to the first bite and crumbles deliciously in the mouth around whatever sandwich filling it holds. Most bakeshops make them using a direct-dough method and knock them out by the thousands. This version, again pushing the limits of our newfound understanding of fermentation and enzyme activity, utilizes old dough, _pâte fermentée,_ to improve flavor, texture, and color, making the resulting rolls significantly better than their commercial counterparts. While strangers will be complaining that they can't find a good old-fashioned New York hard roll, you will be spoiling your friends and family with these bulkies.

Makes 6 large rolls or 9 smaller rolls

1½ cups (8 ounces) _pâte fermentée_

2¼ cups (10 ounces) unbleached bread flour

¾ teaspoon plus a pinch (.2 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) diastatic barley malt powder

or 1½ teaspoons (.33 ounce) barley malt syrup

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

1 large (1.65 ounce) egg, slightly beaten

1½ tablespoons (.75 ounce) vegetable oil or shortening, melted

10 tablespoons to ¾ cup (5 to 6 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Poppy or sesame seeds for topping (optional)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Take the _pâte fermentée_ out of the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it up into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flour, salt, malt powder, and yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _pâte fermentée,_ egg, oil, and 10 tablespoons water. Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) for 1 minute, or until the ingredients form a ball. If there is still some loose flour, add the remaining 2 tablespoons water.

**3. Lightly dust the counter with flour,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for about 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine), adding flour, if needed, to make a dough that is soft and supple, tacky but not sticky. The dough should pass the windowpane test and the internal temperature should register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size. If the dough doubles in size before 2 hours have elapsed, remove it, knead it lightly to degas it, and return it to the bowl to continue fermenting until doubled from original size or until 2 hours have elapsed.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl** and divide it into 6 to 9 equal pieces (4 ounces for large rolls, 2⅔-ounce pieces for smaller rolls). Form the pieces into rolls. Mist the rounds lightly with spray oil, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough relax for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a sheet pan with baking parchment, lightly mist it with spray oil, and then dust with semolina flour or cornmeal.

**6. Prepare the individual rolls by cutting them** with a kaiser roll cutter (see photograph below) or knotting them. Place the rolls, cut side down, on the parchment, mist lightly with spray oil, and loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.

_You can use either a kaiser roll cutter (center) or the knotted-roll technique (left and right) to give your kaiser rolls their distinctive design._

**7. Proof the rolls for 45 minutes at room temperature,** then flip them over so the cut or folded side is facing up. Mist again with spray oil, cover the pan, and continue proofing for another 30 to 45 minutes, or until the rolls are double their original size.

**8. Preheat the oven to 425°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Uncover the rolls and prepare them for baking. If you want seeds on your rolls, mist them with water and sprinkle poppy seeds over the top. If not, just mist them with water.

**9. Place the pan in the oven,** spray the oven walls with water, and close the door. After 10 minutes, rotate the pan for even baking and lower the oven setting to 400°F. Continue baking until the rolls are a medium golden brown and register approximately 200°F in the center. This will take 15 to 30 minutes for large rolls, or less for smaller rolls.

**10. Remove the rolls from the pan** and transfer to a cooling rack. Wait at least 30 minutes before serving.

COMMENTARY

The traditional method for shaping a kaiser roll requires a series of overlapping folds, like making a paper flower. It is time-consuming and difficult to teach. Most people now use a commercial kaiser cutter, either metal or plastic, available at most cookware stores or through mail-order catalogs (see Resources). Equally effective and fun and easy to make is a knotted roll design. The finished roll looks similar to the more difficult overlapping-fold technique.

_Lavash Crackers_

##  Lavash Crackers

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, stiff dough; flat; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

10 to 15 minutes mixing; 2 hours fermentation, shaping, and panning; 15 to 20 minutes baking

Here's a simple formula for making snappy Armenian-style crackers, perfect for breadbaskets, company, and kids. Lavash, though usually called Armenian flatbread, also has Iranian roots and is now eaten throughout the Middle East and around the world. It is similar to the many other Middle Eastern and North African flatbreads known by different names, such as _mankoush_ or _mannaeesh_ (Lebanese), _barbari_ (Iranian), _khoubiz_ or _khobz_ (Arabian), _aiysh_ (Egyptian), _kesret_ and _mella_ (Tunisian), _pide_ or pita (Turkish), and _pideh_ (Armenian). The main difference between these breads is either how thick or thin the dough is rolled out, or the type of oven in which they are baked (or _on_ which they are baked, as many of these breads are cooked on stones or red-hot pans with a convex surface). Some of the breads form a pocket like a pita bread, and some, like the _injera_ of Ethiopia and Eritrea, are thicker and serve as sponges to soak up spicy sauces.

The key to crisp lavash, which is becoming one of the most popular of these flatbread variations, is to roll out the dough paper-thin. The sheet can be cut into crackers in advance or snapped into shards after baking. The shards make a nice presentation when arranged in baskets.

Makes 1 sheet pan of crackers

1½ cups (6.75 ounces) unbleached bread flour

½ teaspoon (.13 ounce) salt

½ teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast

1 tablespoon (.75 ounce) honey

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) vegetable oil

⅓ to ½ cup (3 to 4 ounces) water, at room temperature

Poppy seeds, sesame seeds, paprika, cumin seeds, caraway seeds, or kosher salt for topping

**1. In a mixing bowl, stir together** the flour, salt, yeast, honey, oil, and just enough water to bring everything together into a ball. You may not need the full ½ cup water, but be prepared to use it all if needed.

**2. Sprinkle some flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for about 10 minutes, or until the ingredients are evenly distributed. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. The dough should be firmer than French bread dough, but not quite as firm as bagel dough (what I call a medium-firm dough), satiny to the touch, not tacky, and supple enough to stretch when pulled. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature for 90 minutes,** or until the dough doubles in size. (You can also instead retard the dough overnight in the refrigerator immediately after kneading.)

**4. Mist the counter lightly with spray oil** and transfer the dough to the counter. Press the dough into a square with your hand and dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Roll it out with a rolling pin into a paper-thin sheet about 15 inches by 12 inches. You may have to stop from time to time so that the gluten can relax. At these times, lift the dough from the counter and wave it a little, and then lay it back down. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap while it relaxes. When it is the desired thinness, let the dough relax for 5 minutes. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment. Carefully lift the sheet of dough and lay it on the parchment. If it overlaps the edge of the pan, snip off the excess with scissors.

**5. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Mist the top of the dough with water and sprinkle a covering of seeds or spices on the dough (such as alternating rows of poppy seeds, sesame seeds, paprika, cumin seeds, caraway seeds, kosher or pretzel salt, etc.), as shown in the image below. Be careful with spices; a little goes a long way.

If you want precut crackers, use a pizza cutter (rolling blade), as shown in the image below, and cut diamonds or rectangles in the dough. You do not need to separate the pieces, as they will snap apart after baking. If you want to make shards, bake the sheet of dough without cutting it first.

**5. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes,** or until the crackers begin to brown evenly across the top (the time will depend on how thinly and evenly you rolled the dough).

**6. When the crackers are baked,** remove the pan from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. You can then snap them apart or snap off shards and serve.

COMMENTARY

This dough, almost as stiff as bagel dough, is easier to knead by hand than in a machine.

You can make a softer variation, used for making roll-up pinwheel sandwiches, by rolling the dough a little thicker than described and slightly underbaking the uncut sheet, so that the cracker is stiff but not crackly crisp. When ready to make the roll-up, mist the cracker with water and it will magically soften within 3 to 5 minutes and be as workable as a flour tortilla.

This same dough makes a nice pita bread: Simply roll out 6-ounce pieces of the finished dough into 8-inch-diameter circles (slightly less than ¼ inch thick), and bake them in a 500°F oven on a baking stone or on a sheet pan. Bake just until they inflate and form a pocket. Count to 10, then remove the breads from the oven with a peel or a spatula before they brown and crisp. When they cool (and slowly deflate), they can be cut in half and used for pocket sandwiches.

##  Light Wheat Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 45 to 60 minutes baking

Here, whole-wheat flour accounts for 33 percent of the total flour, which is the most popular formula for making light wheat bread. The result is a loaf similar to the soft wheat breads purchased off the shelves. Of course, this is a poor compromise for whole-grain purists, which is why I am also including a bread formula with 100 percent whole wheat. But there are times when you just want a tasty, soft, but not altogether white sandwich bread, and this versatile loaf fits the bill.

Makes one 2-pound loaf

2½ cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

1½ cups (6.75 ounces) whole-wheat flour

1½ tablespoons (.75 ounce) granulated sugar or honey

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

3 tablespoons (1 ounce) powdered milk (DMS)

1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce) instant yeast

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) shortening or unsalted butter, at room temperature

1¼ cups (10 ounces) water, at room temperature

**1. Stir together the high-gluten flour, whole-wheat flour,** sugar (if using), salt, powdered milk, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the shortening, honey (if using), and water. Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. If there is still flour in the bottom of the bowl, dribble in additional water. The dough should feel soft and supple. It is better for it to be a little too soft than to be too stiff and tough.

**2. Sprinkle high-gluten or whole-wheat flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Add more flour if needed to make a firm, supple dough that is slightly tacky but not sticky. Kneading should take about 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine). The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature for 1½ to 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**4. Remove the dough from the bowl** and press it by hand into a rectangle about ¾ inch thick, 6 inches wide, and 8 to 10 inches long. Form it into a loaf. Place the loaf in a lightly oiled 8½ by 4½-inch bread pan. Mist the top with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap.

**5. Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes,** or until the dough crests above the lip of the pan.

**6. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**7. Place the bread pan on a sheet pan and bake for 30 minutes.** Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the oven. The finished loaf should register 190°F in the center, be golden brown on the top and the sides, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

**8. When the bread is finished baking,** remove it immediately from the loaf pan and cool it on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

This is one formula that is not greatly improved by the pre-ferment or sponge technique. Because it is made by the direct-dough method, though, this formula is especially good for bread machines.

10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 45 to 60 minutes baking

Either of these two formulas will make a delicious rye bread, light or dark. But combined, you can weave them together to make the fabled marbled rye of childhood memories and _Seinfeld_ fame. These are made by the direct-dough method, as opposed to the sourdough method preferred for onion rye and deli rye. But the ease of making these breads, their soft texture, and their flexibility for braiding and blending make them a favorite of my students.

Makes 2 to 4 marbled rye breads

**LIGHT RYE**

1½ cups (6 ounces) white rye flour

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached bread or clear flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

1¾ teaspoons (.19 ounce) instant yeast

1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce) caraway seeds (optional)

1 tablespoon (.75 ounce) molasses

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) shortening

About 1¼ cups plus 2 tablespoons (11 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DARK RYE**

1½ cups (6 ounces) white rye flour

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached bread or clear flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

1¾ teaspoons (.19 ounce) instant yeast

1½ teaspoons (.17 ounce) caraway seeds (optional)

1 tablespoon (.75 ounce) molasses

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) shortening

About 1¼ cups plus 2 tablespoons (11 ounces) water, at room temperature

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) liquid caramel coloring

or 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) cocoa, carob, or coffee powder dissolved in 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) water

**EGG WASH**

1 egg, whisked with 1 teaspoon water until frothy

**1. To make the light rye,** stir together the flours, salt, yeast, and caraway seeds in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the molasses, shortening, and 1¼ cups water. Mix until the dough gathers all the loose flour and forms a ball (or mix for about 1 minute on low speed with the paddle attachment), adding the additional 2 tablespoons of water only if needed. Sprinkle a little flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium-low speed with the dough hook). Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or 4 minutes by machine), adding sprinkles of flour, if necessary. The dough should feel supple and pliable, a little tacky but not sticky. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**2. To make the dark rye,** stir together the flours, salt, yeast, and caraway seeds in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the molasses, shortening, 1¼ cups water, and liquid caramel coloring. Mix until the dough gathers all the loose flour and forms a ball (or mix for about 1 minute on low speed with the paddle attachment), adding the additional 2 tablespoons of water only if needed. Sprinkle a little flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium-low speed with the dough hook). Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or 4 minutes by machine), adding sprinkles of flour, if necessary. The dough should feel supple and pliable, a little tacky but not sticky. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment both doughs at room temperature** for approximately 90 minutes, or until each dough doubles in size.

**4. Turn each of the doughs onto a lightly floured counter** and divide and shape them according to one of the methods shown below.

**5. Mist the loaves with spray oil** and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the loaves nearly double in size. (Most ovens do not hold 2 sheet pans at once, so if you are using sheet pans, put 1 of them in the refrigerator instead of immediately proofing the dough. The dough can then be proofed and baked as much as 2 days later.)

**6. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. For the egg wash, whisk together the egg and water until frothy and brush the loaves evenly but gently with the mixture.

**7. Bake for approximately 45 minutes** (the time will vary depending on the oven and whether you are baking freestanding loaves or in a large or small loaf pan). You may need to rotate the pan(s) 180 degrees after 20 minutes for even baking. The internal temperature of the bread should be 190°F, and the loaves should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom.

**8. When the loaves have finished baking,** remove them immediately from the pans (if using) and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

SHAPING MARBLED RYE LOAVES

Cut each dough into 12 even-sized pieces. Separate the pieces into 2 piles, with an equal number of dark and light pieces in each.

Form each of the piles into a solid mass of dough and then shape each into a _bâtard_.

You can bake the loaves freestanding (recommended) or in oiled 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans. For freestanding loaves, prepare 2 sheet pans by lining each pan with baking parchment. Place a shaped loaf across the length of a pan, using 1 pan for each loaf.

SHAPING BULL'S-EYES OR SPIRAL LOAVES

Divide each dough into 4 even-sized pieces. Roll out each piece with a rolling pin into an oblong about 5 inches wide and 8 inches long. **For spirals,** take a light rye piece and lay a dark rye piece on top, then add a light rye piece, then one more dark rye piece.

Roll this stack up into a _bâtard_ and seal the bottom.

Repeat with the remaining dough to make 2 loaves. Place the loaves across the width of 2 baking parchment–lined sheet pans or in 2 oiled 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans. _For bull's-eyes,_ roll up a dark rye piece into a _bâtard_ about 8 inches long.

Take a light rye piece and wrap it around the _bâtard_ and seal the bottom. Repeat with the remaining dough to make 4 small loaves. Place the loaves on 2 baking parchment–lined sheet pans.

**For braided marbled rye,** divide each dough into 4 even-sized pieces. Roll out each of the pieces into strands about 10 to 12 inches in length, thicker in the middle and slightly tapered toward the ends. Braid 2 light and 2 dark pieces together using the 4-braid method. Place the loaves widthwise on 2 baking parchment–lined sheet pans or in 2 greased 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans.

COMMENTARY

The most important principle when combining two or more bread doughs into one loaf is that they must have a similar texture and rising time. This is to ensure that the texture of each color is the same and that each dough bakes in the same time frame.

Bakers generally use clear flour when making rye bread. This formula works fine with regular bread flour or high-gluten flour, but by all means use clear flour if you have access to it.

White rye flour is milled rye flour that has been sifted twice to remove the bran and germ. However, rye flour, even when sifted, retains an off-white color that distinguishes it from flour milled from wheat berries. There is another version of rye flour called dark rye, milled from the outer endosperm of the rye berry and thus coarser and full of pigments. Another type is called pumper-nickel rye, which is whole rye berries, coarsely milled. There is also a grade called rye meal, which is even more coarsely milled. Dark rye is useful in some breads, especially German-style rye, but it does tend to make a much heavier loaf, not appropriate for the marbled rye of this formula.

You can substitute margarine, vegetable oil, or butter for the shortening if you prefer, but shortening yields the most tender texture.

Caramel coloring is basically burnt sugar and is available in liquid form in some markets and from bakery suppliers. When making dark rye bread with caramel coloring, you may need to hold back an equal amount of water to ensure that the final textures of the light and dark doughs match. Cocoa, instant coffee, or carob powder may be substituted, but they lend a bitter flavor to the dough that some people don't like.

Rye breads should always be mixed for a shorter time than wheat breads because the pentosan gums in the rye interfere with gluten development (rye has a different protein profile than wheat, with glutelin replacing glutenin). Once the dough gums up, no amount of additional flour will make it feel less gummy. If the gums do begin to kick in, finish mixing and proceed anyway, handling the dough with a little flour on your hands to protect against sticking.

##  Multigrain Bread Extraordinaire  
(See photograph)

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 5 minutes soaker

_Day 2:_ 10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 60 minutes baking

I am always exploring the multigrain genre in a never-ending quest for better and better ways to deliver nutritious bread in a delicious package. Adapting some of the advanced concepts we've discussed, such as the soaker technique, to activate enzymes and break out natural sugars seems a natural progression. This is a variation of perhaps my best-known bread, _struan,_ whose flavor in the original version I thought impossible to top. This version preserves that flavor and opens up possibilities for grain variations not possible with the direct-dough technique of the original _struan,_ as described in _Brother Juniper's Bread Book_ and _Bread Upon the Waters._ Substituting, for instance, millet, quinoa, amaranth, or buckwheat for the corn or oats (or simply adding them to the blend) can be accomplished with the soaker method without pre-cooking those grains.

I say this with the confidence born of hundreds of customer testimonials: this bread and its variations make the best toast in the world. Because it is sweetened with both honey and brown sugar, it caramelizes quickly, both while baking and especially when toasting. The many grains hold moisture so that, while the slices crisp up when toasted, they also retain a moist sweetness. The flavors marry extremely well with mayonnaise-based sandwich fillings, such as egg salad, tuna salad, chicken salad, and BLTs. I nearly always top the loaves with poppy seeds because they add a complementary appearance and taste and look more attractive than, say, sesame seeds. The dough can be formed into rolls and freestanding loaves for specific applications, but I believe that the most perfect use of this bread is either for sandwiches or toast (or even better, toasted sandwiches).

Makes one 2-pound loaf or 6 to 12 rolls

**SOAKER**

3 tablespoons (1 ounce) coarse cornmeal (also packaged as "polenta"), millet, quinoa, or amaranth

3 tablespoons (.75 ounce) rolled oats or wheat, buckwheat, or triticale flakes

2 tablespoons (.25 ounce) wheat bran

¼ cup (2 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DOUGH**

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

3 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) brown sugar

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

1 tablespoon (.33 ounce) instant yeast

3 tablespoons (1 ounce) cooked brown rice

1½ tablespoons (1 ounce) honey

½ cup (4 ounces) buttermilk or milk

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature

About 1 tablespoon poppy seeds for topping (optional)

**1. On the day before making the bread, make the soaker.** Combine the cornmeal, oats, and bran with the water in a small bowl. The water will just cover the grain, hydrating it slightly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature overnight to initiate enzyme action.

**2. The next day, to make the dough,** stir together the flour, brown sugar, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the soaker, rice, honey, buttermilk, and water. Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. Add a few drops of water if any of the flour remains separate.

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for about 12 minutes (or mix for 8 to 10 minutes on medium-low speed), sprinkling in flour if needed to make a dough that is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. The individual ingredients will homogenize into the greater dough, disappearing to an extent, and the dough will smooth out and become slightly shiny. (If you are using an electric mixer, hand knead the dough for a minute or two at the end.) The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for 90 minutes,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl** and press it by hand into a rectangle about ¾ inch thick, 6 inches wide, and 8 to 10 inches long. Form it into a loaf, or into another desired shape. Place the loaf into a lightly oiled 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, or onto a sheet pan lined with baking parchment if you are making rolls or freestanding loaves. Mist the top of the dough with water and sprinkle on the poppy seeds. Mist again, this time with spray oil, and loosely cover the dough with plastic wrap or a towel.

**6. Proof for approximately 90 minutes,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size. If you are using a loaf pan, the dough should crest fully above the lip of the pan, doming about 1 inch above the pan at the center.

**7. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**8. Bake for about 20 minutes.** Small rolls probably will be finished at this point. For everything else, rotate the pan 180 degrees and continue baking for another 15 minutes for freestanding loaves and 20 to 40 minutes for loaf-pan bread. The bread should register at least 185° to 190°F in the center, be golden brown, and make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom.

**9. When the loaves are finished baking,** remove them immediately from the pans and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

If you do not have wheat bran on hand, you can sift whole-wheat flour through a fine sieve and extract the bran. The flour that sifts through can be used in rye breads or in _pain de campagne_ (or it can be stirred back into the whole-wheat flour).

This formula uses such a small amount of cooked rice that it's hardly worth cooking it just for the bread (unless you are making a larger batch of bread than this version). I suggest making brown rice for a meal and holding some back for special uses like this bread. You can keep it refrigerated for up to 4 days (any longer and it develops enzyme characteristics detrimental to the dough development), or freeze it in small packets for use over the next 6 months. You can also substitute cooked white or wild rice, but brown rice blends in the best.

You can leave out the milk altogether and replace it with an equal amount of water. The bread will be slightly chewier and lighter in appearance without milk, as the milk not only tenderizes and enriches the dough, but also adds a small amount of lactose sugar that helps caramelize the crust.

_Pain à l'Ancienne_

##  Pain à l'Ancienne

BREAD PROFILE:

Lean, rustic dough; direct method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 10 to 15 minutes mixing

_Day 2:_ 2 to 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and panning; 15 to 30 minutes baking

The technique by which this bread is made has tremendous implications for the baking industry and for both professional and home bakers. The unique delayed-fermentation method, which depends on ice-cold water, releases flavors trapped in flour in a way different from the more traditional twelve-stage method. The final product has a natural sweetness and nutlike character that is distinct from breads made with exactly the same ingredients but fermented by the standard method, even with large percentages of pre-ferment. Also, because the dough is as wet as rustic ciabatta-style dough, it can be used in many ways, from baguettes, as Philippe Gosselin does in Paris, to ciabatta, pugliese, _stirato, pain rustique,_ and even pizza and focaccia.

This bread shows us another way to manipulate time, and thus outcomes, by manipulating temperature. The cold mixing and fermentation cycles delay the activation of the yeast until after the amylase enzymes have begun their work of breaking out sugar from the starch. When the dough is brought to room temperature and the yeast wakes up and begins feasting, it feeds on sugars that weren't there the day before. Because the yeast has converted less of the released sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide, a reserve of sugar remains in the fermented dough to flavor it and caramelize the crust during the baking cycle. While this delayed-fermentation method doesn't work for every dough (especially those that are enriched with sugar and other flavor-infusing ingredients), used appropriately, it evokes the fullness of flavor from the wheat beyond any other fermentation method I've encountered. As a bonus, and despite all the intimidating science, this is actually one of the easiest doughs in this book to make.

Without question this is the dough that has gotten the most recent attention from my students at Johnson & Wales, The California Culinary Academy, and around the country in my daylong workshops for home bakers. It is not just the flavor of the bread that excites them, although without it the concept would be interesting but moot. It is the idea of pressing into new frontiers of bread making, of realizing that there are still areas of exploration not charted by even the professional community. We are learning that as we deconstruct the bread-baking process, we are still in the early discovery stage of what is possible. As in any facet of life, this is an exciting place to find oneself, like standing at the end of the world, facing the words, as so often showed up on ancient maps, "Unknown Kingdoms Be Here."

Makes 6 baguettes, 6 to 8 pizzas, or one 17 by 12-inch focaccia

6 cups (27 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2¼ teaspoons (.56 ounce) salt

1¾ teaspoons (.19 ounce) instant yeast

2¼ cups plus 2 table-spoons to 3 cups (19 to 24 ounces) water, ice cold (40°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Combine the flour, salt, yeast, and 19 ounces of water** in the bowl of the electric mixer with the paddle attachment and mix for 2 minutes on low speed. Switch to the dough hook and mix for 5 to 6 minutes on medium speed. The dough should be sticky on the bottom of the bowl but it should release from the sides of the bowl. If not, sprinkle in a small amount of flour until this occurs (or dribble in water if the dough seems too stiff and clears the bottom as well as the sides of the bowl). Lightly oil a large bowl and immediately transfer the dough with a spatula or bowl scraper dipped in water into the bowl. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**2. Immediately place the bowl in the refrigerator and retard overnight.**

**3. The next day, check the dough to see if it has risen** in the refrigerator. It will probably be partially risen but not doubled in size (the amount of rise will depend on how cold the refrigerator is and how often the door was opened). Leave the bowl of dough out at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours (or longer if necessary) to allow the dough to wake up, lose its chill, and continue fermenting.

**4. When the dough has doubled** from its original prerefrigerated size, liberally sprinkle the counter with bread flour (about ½ cup). Gently transfer the dough to the floured counter with a plastic dough scraper that has been dipped in cold water, dipping your hands as well to keep the dough from sticking to you. Try to degas the dough as little as possible as you transfer it. If the dough is very wet, sprinkle more flour over the top as well as under it. Dry your hands thoroughly and then dip them in flour. Roll the dough gently in the sprinkled flour to coat it thoroughly, simultaneously stretching it into an oblong about 8 inches long and 6 inches wide. If it is too sticky to handle, continue sprinkling flour over it. Dip a metal pastry scraper into cool water to keep it from sticking to the dough, and cut the dough in half widthwise with the pastry scraper by pressing it down through the dough until it severs it, then dipping it again in the water and repeating this action until you have cut down the full length of the dough. (Do not use this blade as a saw; use it as a pincer, pinching the dough cleanly with each cut.) Let the dough relax for 5 minutes.

_Like all rustic doughs, this one requires lots of extra flour, both on your hands and on the counter, in order to handle it._

**5.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F (550°F if your oven goes this high). Cover the back of two 17 by 12-inch sheet pans with baking parchment and dust with semolina flour or cornmeal. Proceed with shaping as shown below.

**6.Score the dough strips as for baguettes**, slashing the tops with 3 diagonal cuts (or see Commentary regarding scissors). Because the dough is sticky, you may have to dip the razor blade or serrated knife in water between each cut. You may also omit the cuts if the dough isn't cooperating.

SHAPING PAIN À L'ANCIENNE BAGUETTES

Take 1 of the dough pieces and repeat the cutting action, but this time cut off 3 equal-sized lengths. Then do the same with the remaining half. This should give you 6 lengths.

Flour your hands and carefully lift 1 of the dough strips and transfer it to a parchment-lined pan, gently pulling it to the length of the pan or to the length of your baking stone.

If it springs back, let it rest for 5 minutes and then gently pull it out again. Place 3 strips on the pan, and then prepare another pan and repeat with the remaining strips.

**7. Take 1 pan to the preheated oven** and carefully slide the dough, parchment and all, onto the baking stone (depending on the direction of the stone, you may choose to slide the dough and parchment off the side of the sheet pan instead of off the end); or bake directly on the sheet pan. Make sure the pieces aren't touching (you can reach in and straighten the parchment or the dough strips if need be). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 475°F and continue baking. Meanwhile, dust the other pan of strips with flour, mist with spray oil, and slip into a food-grade plastic bag or cover with a towel or plastic wrap. If you don't plan to bake these strips within 1 hour, refrigerate the pan and bake later or the next day. If you'd like to bake them as rustic, ciabatta-style breads, leave them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours and then bake. As the loaves proof, they will resemble and perform like ciabatta.

**8. The bread should begin to turn golden brown within 8 or 9 minutes.** If the loaves are baking unevenly at this point, rotate them 180 degrees. Continue baking 10 to 15 minutes more, or until the bread is a rich golden brown and the internal temperature registers at least 205°F.

**9. Transfer the hot breads to a cooling rack.** They should feel very light, almost airy, and will cool in about 20 minutes. While these are cooling, you can bake the remaining loaves, remembering to remove the parchment from the oven and turn the oven up to 500°F or higher before baking the second round.

COMMENTARY

This dough also makes great oil-free pizza dough or focaccia. Refer to the variations that follow and then the formulas for _Pizza Napoletana_ and Focaccia.

This dough is very sticky, like ciabatta dough, so it is best made in an electric mixer or a food processor. However, if mixing by hand, use the method described.

One of the testers of this recipe, Jill Myers, suggested using sharp scissors to score the bread instead of a knife or razor. This is a great idea, as the wet dough is difficult to slit in the normal manner. If you are using this method, try to get a long angle with the shears and make a long cut rather than just short snips.

For the ice-cold water required for the dough, take 3 cups cold water from the refrigerator, add 8 ice cubes, wait 2 minutes, and then measure out 3 cups (24 ounces).

GRACE NOTE

Pain à l'Ancienne Pizza

Heavily flour the counter and gently transfer the fully fermented dough from the bowl to the counter with a plastic dough scraper that had been dipped in cold water, dipping your hands as well to keep the dough from sticking to you. Divide the dough by continually dipping the pastry scraper into water and cutting the dough into 6 to 8 equal pieces. Gently round the pieces into balls, being careful not to degas them any more than necessary. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and spray lightly with oil. Place the floured dough balls on the parchment. Mist them with spray oil and place the pan into a food-grade plastic bag or loosely cover with plastic wrap, and return the pan to the refrigerator, unless you plan to make the pizzas immediately. These pizza doughs will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. (You may also put them into the freezer in individual zipper bags, and keep them for up to 3 months.) Remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before shaping and baking your pizza and proceed with Step 4 of Pizza Napoletana.

Pain à l'Ancienne Foccacia

Line a 17 by 12-inch sheet pan with baking parchment. With floured hands, take the fully fermented dough from the bowl and proceed with shaping instructions for focaccia. Ferment at room temperature for about 2 to 3 hours, or until the dough rises and fills the pan, rising to about 1 inch thick. Proceed with the baking instructions for focaccia.

BREAD PROFILE:

Lean, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 1¼ hours _pâte fermentée_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _pâte fermentée;_ 12 to 15 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 25 to 35 minutes baking

This is the perfect dough for creative shaping, and the one used throughout France for many types of breads sold under various local names. The dough is similar to regular French baguette dough, but it includes a small percentage of whole grain, either whole wheat, pumpernickel-grind or white rye, or cornmeal. This additional grain gives the bread more character and grain flavor, and contributes to the brownish-gold, country-style crust that distinguishes it from white flour French bread. Most important, this is the dough, as I learned it from Professor Raymond Calvel, that opened my thinking to the use of large percentages of pre-ferment.

You can make a number of shapes from this dough. The most famous are the _fendu, épi, couronne,_ and _auvergnat._ There are many others that you may also have seen. As always, though, the first emphasis must be on the quality of the dough. There is nothing more disappointing to a bread lover than to see a lot of work go into a shaping technique for a dough that does not deliver world-class flavor and texture. This particular dough never disappoints.

Makes 3 loaves of various shapes or numerous rolls

3 cups (16 ounces) _pâte fermentée_

1¾ cups (8 ounces) unbleached bread flour

⅓ cup (1.5 ounces) whole-wheat or rye flour (or a combination)

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, lukewarm (90 to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the _pâte fermentée_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flours, salt, yeast** and _pâte fermentée_ pieces in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment). Add a few drops of additional water, if needed, to gather any loose flour into the ball. The dough should be soft and pliable.

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for 8 to 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine), sprinkling in bread flour if needed to make a soft, pliable dough. It should be tacky but not sticky. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature** for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size. If the dough doubles in size more quickly, knead lightly to degas it and let it rise again, covered, until it doubles from original size.

**5. Sprinkle a small amount of flour on the counter** and gently remove the dough from the bowl, being careful to degas it as little as possible. Divide the dough into 3 or more pieces by cutting it with a pastry scraper or a serrated knife, again trying to avoid degassing any more than necessary. Shape the dough, depending on what shape you desire (baguette, _bâtard, couronne, épi, fendu,_ or _auvergnat_ ). Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and sprinkle with semolina flour or cornmeal and transfer the dough to the pans (or use the _couche_ method described earlier in the book). Mist the dough with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap, a food-grade plastic bag, or a towel.

**6. Proof for about 1 hour,** or until the pieces are approximately 1½ times their original size.

**7.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. If you are making _épis,_ you can make the scissors cuts.

**_8. Épis_ can be baked directly on the sheet pans.** For other shapes, generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the dough pieces to the peel or pan. Slide the dough onto the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and continue baking for 10 minutes. Check the loaves and, if necessary, rotate them 180 degrees for even baking. Continue to bake for 10 to 15 more minutes for baguettes and _fendus,_ less for rolls. They should be a rich golden brown all around and register 200° to 205°F in the center of the loaf. The bread should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

**9. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack** (off the sheet pan if used). Allow the bread to cool for at least 40 minutes before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

The amount of whole grain used in this dough may vary from region to region, but typically it amounts to somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the total flour. Feel free to adjust the relationship of white to whole grain as you play with this formula.

As with the baguette, this formula utilizes a full batch of dough as the pre-ferment for the final dough, effectively doubling the amount. Because the baker's formula is based on the relationship of each ingredient (in this case, _pâte fermentée_ ) to total flour weight, the percentage of pre-ferment amounts to 168 percent against the combined weight of bread flour and whole-wheat or rye flour. It is this huge amount of pre-ferment that makes the bread perform so well in a home kitchen.

_Pane Siciliano_

##  Pane Siciliano

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 3

_Day 1:_ 1¼ hours _pâte fermentée_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _pâte fermentée;_ 12 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and panning

_Day 3:_ 0 to 2 hours proofing; 30 to 35 minutes baking

This is one of the breakthrough breads that taught me the value of combining large portions of pre-ferment with overnight cold fermentation. Semolina is the gritty, sandy flour milled from durum wheat. (Durum is the strain of wheat most closely identified with pasta.) It is a hard, high-protein wheat, but it is not high in gluten. The golden color is mainly due to a high proportion of beta-carotene, which contributes both aroma and flavor as well as the appealing hue. You may substitute a finer grind of this flour, called fancy durum (sometimes labeled "extra fancy durum"). When it is labeled "fancy durum," the flour is milled to the consistency of regular bread flour. This is the grind used in pasta and also used in the 100 percent durum bread called pugliese.

This version of _pane siciliano_ consists of 40 percent semolina flour and 60 percent high-gluten or bread flour. The finished loaf has a beautiful blistered crust, not too crackly, and a crumb with large, irregular holes, open to the same degree as good French or Italian bread. The sweetness and nutty quality of the semolina, and the complementary flavor of the sesame-seed garnish make this one of my absolute favorite breads.

Makes 3 loaves

3 cups (16 ounces) _pâte fermentée_

1¾ cups (8 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

1¾ cups (8 ounces) semolina flour

1¼ teaspoons (.31 ounce) salt

1¼ teaspoons (.14 ounce) instant yeast

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) olive oil

1 tablespoon (.75 ounce) honey

1¼ to 1½ cups (10 to 12 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Natural, brown, and/or black sesame seeds for topping

**1. Remove the _pâte fermentée_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the high-gluten flour, semolina flour, salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _pâte fermentée_ pieces, the oil, honey, and 1¼ cups water. Stir with a large spoon until the dough forms a ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment). If the dough seems too stiff, dribble in water 1 teaspoon at a time until all the flour is gathered and the dough feels soft and pliable. If the dough seems sticky don't worry; you can adjust the flour while kneading or mixing.

**3. Sprinkle bread flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and knead (or mix on medium-low speed with the dough hook). Add flour as needed, sprinkling in a small amount at a time to make a smooth dough that is tacky but not sticky and has the same pliability and suppleness as French bread dough. Knead for about 10 minutes (or for 6 to 8 minutes by machine). The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Form the dough into a ball, lightly oil a large bowl, and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for about 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Gently divide the dough into 3 equal pieces.** Shape as for baguettes, extending each piece to about 24 inches in length and taking care to degas the dough as little as possible. Then, working from each end simultaneously, coil the dough toward the center, forming an S shape (see image below). Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and sprinkle some semolina flour on the baking parchment. Place each loaf on the pan (or set up 1 loaf each on individual pans). Mist the loaves with water and sprinkle sesame seeds on the top of each loaf. Then mist the tops with vegetable spray oil and place the pan(s) in a food-grade plastic bag or loosely cover with plastic wrap.

**6. Place the pan(s) in the refrigerator overnight.**

**7. The next day, remove the pan(s) from the refrigerator** and determine whether the loaves have risen enough to bake or if they need additional proofing time. Gently poke the dough. If it springs back quickly, leave the pan(s) out, still covered, for a couple of hours, or until it wakes up and rises more. The dough should stay dimpled when poked, and the loaves should be nearly twice as large as when first shaped.

**8.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to put an empty steam pan in place. You do not need a baking stone. Preheat the oven to 500°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**9. Uncover the bread dough and place the pan(s) in the oven.** Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for about 15 minutes. If the loaves are touching, gently separate them. Rotate the pan(s) 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until the loaves are a rich golden brown all over. If there are still light or white sections of the dough, extend the baking time for a few extra minutes to maximize color and flavor. The internal temperature of the bread should register 200° to 205°F.

**10. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the loaves** to a cooling rack. Cool for at least 45 minutes before serving. One way to slice this bread is to cut it lengthwise down the middle. Lay the cut side on the cutting board to stabilize the loaf, and then slice into ¾-inch-thick slices across the width, either straight down or on a slight diagonal.

COMMENTARY

This dough can be used for many purposes beyond the traditional S-shaped loaf. It can be used as a pizza dough (it makes enough for six 8-ounce pizza crusts), for small rolls of any shape, and is also great for breadsticks.

The bread can, in theory, be baked on the same day that it is shaped, but the difference in flavor and texture is dramatic if it is held overnight in the refrigerator (retarding method), as advised in the instructions. The overnight step makes this a 3-day process, though the final day is simply to bake the bread. Those who tested this recipe say the results are worth the delayed gratification.

##  Panettone

BREAD PROFILE:

_Rich, standard dough; indirect method; mixed leavening method_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 5 minutes mixing; 4 hours fermentation

_Day 2:_ 12 to 15 minutes mixing; 4 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 25 to 90 minutes baking

Panettone is a traditional, rich Christmas bread originating in Milan. There are many folktales about its origins, the most popular being that it was created a few hundred years ago by a humble baker named Tony to woo his beloved, the daughter of a rich merchant. More importantly, he had to win over the father to the idea of his daughter marrying a baker, so he pulled out all the stops, filling his bread with the baker's equivalent of the gifts of the wise men: butter, brandied dried and candied fruits, nuts, and sugar. The merchant was so impressed that he not only gave his daughter in marriage, but also set Tony up with his own bakery in Milan with the promise that he would continue to make his bread, _pane Tony._

For many years the standard panettone found in most bakeries and cookbooks has been one made with commercial yeast, a good but not great rendition. The best and most traditional versions are made by wild-yeast fermentation, augmented by a small amount of commercial yeast. Recently, one of the largest panettone bakeries in Italy changed its formula from commercial yeast to wild yeast, returning to the more traditional method that had all but been abandoned. The bakers discovered that not only does the bread have a longer shelf life due to the increased acidity, but it also outsold the commercial-yeast version. This added up to a huge increase in profits and, more importantly, to happier customers.

The following formula will produce a long-keeping loaf that could easily become a perennial favorite at holiday time. It is more time-consuming to produce, but that's the price of world-class quality. You can also make a perfectly good panettone by following the Stollen formula, shaping it in the round panettone style.

Makes 2 large or many small loaves

**WILD-YEAST SPONGE**

1 cup (7 ounces) barm

1 cup (8 ounces) milk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

1 cup (4.5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour

**FRUIT BLEND**

1 cup (6 ounces) golden raisins

1 cup (6 ounces) candied fruit blend (see Commentary)

½ cup (4 ounces) brandy, rum, or whiskey

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) orange or lemon extract

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) vanilla extract or Fiori di Sicilia (see Commentary)

**DOUGH**

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour

3 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) granulated sugar

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

1 tablespoon (.33 ounce) instant yeast (see Commentary)

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, at room temperature and slightly beaten

1 large (.65 ounce) egg yolk

4 to 6 tablespoons (2 to 3 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

½ cup (4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 cup (5 ounces) blanched almonds, slivered or chopped

**1. The day before making the bread, make the wild-yeast sponge.** Stir together the barm, milk, and flour in a mixing bowl just long enough to hydrate all the flour and to make a sponge. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for approximately 4 hours, or until the sponge begins to foam and bubble, then put it in the refrigerator overnight.

**2. While waiting for the sponge to ferment,** mix together the raisins and candied fruit in a bowl. Add the liquor and extracts. Cover the bowl and let this sit out overnight to allow the fruit to fully absorb the liquid.

**3. The next day, remove the wild-yeast sponge from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.

**4. To make the dough,** stir together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the sponge, the egg, and the egg yolk. Stir these together (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until they form a firm, but supple, ball. Add as much of the lukewarm water as needed to form a dough. Stop mixing and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes to let the gluten begin to develop. Add the softened butter and the soaked fruit mixture and continue mixing until the ingredients are evenly distributed.

**5. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on low speed with the dough hook). Knead (or mix) the dough gently for 2 to 4 minutes, until it is soft and supple but not overly sticky (it can be very tacky). Add flour if necessary (you will probably have to sprinkle small amounts of flour continually as you knead to keep it from sticking to your hands, but use only the minimum necessary to allow you to knead without getting the dough all over your hands). While kneading, gradually work in the almonds until they too are evenly distributed. The entire process, after the resting period _,_ should take 6 to 10 minutes. The dough must be soft and supple, tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**6. Ferment the dough at room temperature** for approximately 2 hours. It will rise very slowly and should increase to only about 1½ times its original size.

**7. If you are not using professional panettone papers,** prepare pans as shown in the Preparing Panettone Pans sidebar.

**8. Divide the dough into the desired sizes.** If you are making large 2-pound loaves, divide the dough in half and round the pieces into 2 _boules_. Place them into the baking papers or into prepared pans 6 inches in diameter. Press the dough down slightly to spread it into the papers or pans. The dough should reach halfway up the forms. Mist the dough with spray oil and loosely cover the pans with plastic wrap. If you are making mini panettones, use individual-size baking papers or grease muffin pans and fill each cup half full. (You will not need to make parchment collars or bottoms for the muffin pans.) For large and small loaves alike, proof the dough at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until it nearly doubles and has risen just to the height of the papers or pans.

**9. Preheat the oven to 325°F** with the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.

**10. Bake large loaves for up to 1½ hours,** depending on the oven; bake mini loaves for 25 to 35 minutes. The top of the dough may get very dark before the center reaches 185°F. If so, cover the tops with aluminum foil or a sheet of baking parchment. The finished breads should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom, be golden brown all around, and register at least 185°F in the center. If using baking papers, you may leave the bread in the paper while it cools, but remove it from the pans. In any case, transfer the breads to a cooling rack and thoroughly cool before serving, at least 2 hours.

**11. These breads are best kept by wrapping them in aluminum foil** after they completely cool. They can be stored at room temperature for as long as 2 weeks. (Some people keep them longer, but I think they lose quality beyond this point.) You can also freeze them for up to 3 months to save for special occasions.

_COMMENTARY_

The formula calls for candied fruit, but many people prefer using dried fruit, such as dried cranberries, apricots, and apples. Feel free to make a substitution if you prefer.

The SAF company makes a gold-labeled yeast that is osmotolerant, which means it performs well in acidic and extra-sweet doughs. It is now available to home bakers but is not required. Regular instant yeast will also work, but it may take longer to wake up and perform, as the sugar and acid in the dough tends to shock it.

You are free to experiment with your liquor and extract choices. Some people prefer to use orange liqueur, for instance, or regular or flavored brandy (like cherry schnapps), whiskey, or rum. Extracts, such as almond, orange, or lemon, are also alcohol-based, but the flavors are highly concentrated, so in some respects you will get more bang for your buck. I prefer to use a blend of both liquor and extracts, but you can double the amount of extract and eliminate the liquor. Fiori di Sicilia, a wonderful blend of extracts and floral oils that is ideal in this bread, is available through the Baker's Catalogue (see Resources) as well as other sources.

It is now possible to buy professional panettone baking papers (pictured here) at kitchenware stores or through mail-order catalogs (see Resources). Like muffn-cup papers, they allow you to bake the loaves in them while being decorative enough to leave the baked loaves in them. They come in many sizes, and though they do not require oiling, I always mist them with spray oil for release. If you bake your panettone in standard round pans or muffin tins, consult the photographs of readying the pans for baking.

GRACE NOTE   _Holiday Bread Brûlé_

This is a great way to turn holiday bread into a simple but impressive dessert. It is essentially a fancy bread pudding with a broiled sugar top. I first made it at Philippe Chin's restaurant, Philippe on Locust, for Philadelphia's the Book & the Cook Festival in March 2000. Pastry Chef Michael Vandergeest added some creative serving accompaniments—fresh raspberries with a few drizzles of chocolate sauce and raspberry sorbet—to make this an elegant presentation. The sorbet lent a nice flavor contrast to the rich bread pudding brûlé. Here's how to make it:

Bake a full batch of either Panettone or Stollen in 8 to 12 small rounds (I baked them in muffin cups at Philippe's, using about 3 ounces of dough for each). After baking, cut off the tops and scoop out the insides, collecting the scooped dough for the pudding. Set the hollowed shells and tops aside and cover with plastic wrap.

Make a custard base by combining 1½ cups milk or heavy cream; 1 cup sugar; ½ teaspoon salt; 3 large eggs; 1 tablespoon vanilla extract; 1 tablespoon orange, lemon, or almond extract; and ¼ cup rum or brandy (optional).

Whisk into a smooth batter. Pour the batter over the scooped bread pieces. Spread this mixture into an oiled 6-inch-square baking pan or 1-quart casserole dish and place this dish in another, larger ovenproof dish or pan. Place the double pan in a preheated 325°F oven and pour enough hot water into the outer pan to protect the sides of the smaller pan, up to the height of the bread filling. Bake for approximately 1 hour, or until the bread pudding is above 180°F in the center. Carefully remove the pans from the oven and then remove the smaller dish from the larger and cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and cool it in the refrigerator for another hour (or overnight).

Fill the hollowed bread shells with the bread pudding, sprinkle granulated sugar over the top (you can also use coarse AA sugar or sanding sugar if you have some on hand), and lightly mist it with water. Place under a broiler for about 3 minutes, or until the sugar melts and caramelizes. (If you have a small blowtorch, you can also caramelize the tops individually with the torch.) Lean the top of the shell against the side of the loaf or arrange decoratively.

Serve alone or with sorbet and berries.

PREPARING PANETTONE PANS

Use the bottom of the round pan to trace a circle on baking parchment.

Cut out the circle and place it in the bottom of the pan.

You may also make a parchment collar to ensure easy removal after baking. Note: If using muffin pans, there's no need to use parchment lining.

##  Pizza Napoletana

BREAD PROFILE:

_Lean or enriched, rustic dough; flat; direct method; commercial yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 8 to 12 minutes mixing; 5 to 10 minutes dividing and rounding

_Day 2:_ 2 hours resting; 10 to 25 minutes per pizza shaping; 5 to 7 minutes baking

Pizza is the perfect food, or so I'm so often told. When I moved to Providence, Rhode Island, I'd heard that there was great pizza to be had, so I asked everyone I met to recommend his or her favorite place. They all seemed to have a different style that they preferred, not unlike the diversity I've found in similar explorations into barbecue and chili. There is Sicilian thick-crusted pizza and thin New York style (the kind where the nose of the slice has to be flipped back into the center of the slice to keep all the cheese from running off). At least two-dozen franchise pizza shops exist within a three-mile radius of my home, some with prebaked shells, others with house-made crust. There are double-decker pizzas, cheese-in-the-crust pizzas, and a very popular twice-baked crust, recently dubbed Argentinian pizza in some regions, but here it is mysteriously and incorrectly referred to as Neapolitan.

The best pizza I've had in recent years was in Phoenix at Pizzeria Bianco, a small restaurant run by Chris Bianco and his friends and family. Chris grows his own basil and lettuce behind the restaurant, makes his own mozzarella cheese, and hand-mixes his pizza dough in large batches (I mean really hand-mixes, on a bench and by hand). It is wet dough, like ciabatta, and sits for hours slowly fermenting. His is the closest I've had to pizza made in the style of Naples: simple, thin crusted, and baked fast and crisp. Pizzeria Bianco serves only about six kinds of pizza, a house salad, house-made Italian bread (from the pizza dough), and three or so desserts made by Chris's mom. They can't keep up with the business, and getting a seat in the pizzeria is like winning the lottery.

Naples is the birthplace of what we today call pizza. Genoa has its focaccia, Tuscany its _schiacciata,_ and Sicily its _sfincione,_ but true Neapolitan pizza is the perfect expression of the perfect food. Every other style may also be crust and topping, but life would be better if only this superior version were allowed to call itself pizza. More to the point, it is possible to make a great pizza at home even if your oven cannot reach the heat levels used by the very best pizzerias that burn hardwood or bituminous coal and reach between 800° and 1200°F!

Jeffrey Steingarten wrote a wonderful piece in the August 2000 issue of _Vogue_ in which he told of trying dozens of ways to generate enough heat to replicate a pizza oven in his home. He nearly burned down his house in the process. Unfortunately, most home ovens will not go beyond 550°F, if that, but the following dough will produce an amazing pizza even at that relatively low heat.

It has long been my contention that it is the crust, not the toppings, that make a pizza memorable. I've seen some expensive, wonderful ingredients wasted on bad crust, or, even more often, a decent dough ruined in an oven that was not hot enough to bake it properly. For many years, cookbook instructions have been to bake at about 350°F or maybe at 425°F. Rarely do you see instructions that suggest cranking the oven to its fullest capacity, but that's what you have to do to make a great pizza at home.

The single biggest flaw in most pizza dough recipes is the failure to instruct the maker to allow the dough to rest overnight in the refrigerator (or at least for a long time). This gives the enzymes time to go to work, pulling out subtle flavor trapped in the starch. The long rest also relaxes the gluten, allowing you to shape the dough easily, minimizing the elastic springiness that so often forces you to squeeze out all the gas.

Lately, there's been a controversy regarding what type of flour to use. Unbleached is a given. It simply delivers more flavor and aroma. For the past few years the trend has been toward high-gluten or bread flour because it promotes oven spring and holds together better during handling (this is called dough "tolerance"). The trend now is to suggest all-purpose flour because it is more tender, that is, less hard (the hardness of flour is based on the amount of protein it contains). It makes sense that softer flour will have a softer chew, but it also makes the dough more prone to tear or rip when you toss it or roll it out.

The formula that follows will work with either type of flour, but I recommend adding olive oil to the high-gluten dough to tenderize it. (True Neapolitan dough is made without oil—it's actually a requirement—but Italian flour is, by nature, more slack and tender but very extensible and easy to form.) I find that high-gluten flour, despite its springy elasticity, is easier to work with as long as you give it plenty of rest. If you are using all-purpose flour, you can leave out the oil. As we so often must say when there is more than one way to make something, try it both ways and decide for yourself which flour you prefer. My guess is, as with pizza in general, for every ten people who make the dough, there will be eleven opinions.

Makes six 6-ounce pizza crusts

4½ cups (20.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten, bread, or all-purpose flour, chilled

1¾ teaspoons (.44 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

¼ cup (2 ounces) olive or vegetable oil (optional)

1¾ cups (14 ounces) water, ice cold (40°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment). **If you aremixing by hand,** repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. **If you are using an electric mixer,** switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a teaspoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50° to 55°F.

**2. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter.** Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with baking parchment and misting the parchment with spray oil (or lightly oil the parchment). Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 6 equal pieces (or larger if you are comfortable shaping large pizzas). You can dip the scraper into the water between cuts to keep the dough from sticking to it. Sprinkle flour over the dough. Make sure your hands are dry and then flour them. Lift each piece and gently round it into a ball. If the dough sticks to your hands, dip your hands into the flour again. Transfer the dough balls to the sheet pan. Mist the dough generously with spray oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag.

**3. Put the pan into the refrigerator overnight to rest the dough,** or keep for up to 3 days. (Note: If you want to save some of the dough for future baking, you can store the dough balls in a zippered freezer bag. Dip each dough ball into a bowl that has a few tablespoons of oil in it, rolling the dough in the oil, and then put each ball into a separate bag. You can place the bags into the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer them to the refrigerator the day before you plan to make pizza.)

**4. On the day you plan to make the pizza,** remove the desired number of dough balls from the refrigerator 2 hours before making the pizza. Dust the counter with flour, and then mist the counter with spray oil. Place the dough balls on top of the floured counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour. Gently press the dough into flat disks about ½ inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the dough with flour, mist it again with spray oil, and cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Let rest for 2 hours.

**5. At least 45 minutes before making the pizza,** place a baking stone either on the floor of the oven (for gas ovens), or on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven as hot as possible, up to 800°F (most home ovens will go only to 500° to 550°F, but some will go higher). If you do not have a baking stone, you can use the back of a sheet pan, but do not preheat the pan.

**6. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal. Make the pizzas one at a time. Dip your hands, including the backs of your hands and knuckles, in flour and lift 1 piece of dough by getting under it with a pastry scraper. Very gently lay the dough across your fists and carefully stretch it by bouncing the dough in a circular motion on your hands, carefully giving it a little stretch with each bounce. If it begins to stick to your hands, lay it down on the floured counter and reflour your hands, then continue shaping it. Once the dough has expanded outward, move to a full toss. If you have trouble tossing the dough, or if the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax, and try again. You can also resort to using a rolling pin, though this isn't as effective as the toss method.

**7. When the dough is stretched out to your satisfaction** (about 9 to 12 inches in diameter for a 6-ounce piece of dough), lay it on the peel or pan, making sure there is enough semolina flour or cornmeal to allow it to slide. Lightly top it with sauce and then with your other toppings, remembering that the best pizzas are topped with a less-is-more philosophy. The American "kitchen sink" approach is counterproductive, as it makes the crust more difficult to bake. A few, usually no more than 3 or 4 toppings, including sauce and cheese is sufficient (see the Grace Note at the end of the recipe for ideas).

**8. Slide the topped pizza onto the stone** (or bake directly on the sheet pan) and close the door. Wait 2 minutes, then take a peek. If it needs to be rotated 180 degrees for even baking, do so. The pizza should take about 5 to 8 minutes to bake. If the top gets done before the bottom, you will need to move the stone to a lower shelf before the next round. If the bottom crisps before the cheese caramelizes, then you will need to raise the stone for subsequent bakes.

**9. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board.** Wait 3 to 5 minutes before slicing and serving, to allow the cheese to set slightly.

_COMMENTARY_

This formula utilizes the _pain à l'ancienne_ delayed-fermentation technique, but this version has a small amount of olive oil to tenderize the dough. The oil can be left out, if desired, which also conforms to the strictest guidelines of authentic Neapolitan pizza. Both versions make the best pizza dough I have ever had or made. Using the delayed-fermentation method accomplishes all the flavor objectives of _poolish_ and _biga_ methods, and the small amount of yeast is just enough to leaven the dough without eating up all the sugar during fermentation. The result is a naturally sweet, thin, golden crust that crisps on the bottom and the edges but retains enough moisture to taste creamy in the mouth.

Baking pizza at a low temperature ruins the crust because it takes so long to brown it that all the moisture evaporates, leaving a cardboard-dry shell behind. The key to great pizza is an extremely hot oven and baking surface. The race between browning the crust and melting the cheese is one of the great culinary dramas, and if they converge at exactly the same moment, you will have a memorable experience. The thinner you can stretch the dough without tearing it, and the more evenly you stretch it, the more likely that this baking convergence will occur.

This dough can also be used to make focaccia and any rustic bread.

It is perfectly acceptable to add a small amount (about 10 percent) of whole-wheat or rye flour to the dough, substituting it for an equal amount of the white flour. This gives the pizza a more rustic quality, kind of a peasant-style crust.

I use water that I've chilled in the refrigerator to 40°F (the usual temperature for refrigerators). If you don't have cold water, float some ice cubes in a beaker of water long enough to chill it to at least 40°F (colder is even better), then measure out what you need. Also, it improves the dough if you put the flour in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before mixing or, preferably, the day before.

GRACE NOTE   _Some Pointers for Making a Better Pizza_

Your sauce should not be too thick, as it will thicken in the hot oven. You do not need a lot of sauce, and you do not need red sauce. Pesto, white or brown sauce, and cheese without sauce are viable options. Fresh clams tossed in garlic oil and spices (as made justifiably famous at Frank Pepé's Pizzeria in New Haven, Connecticut) is an amazing combination, topped with just cheese. Less is more—but make the less truly more by using quality ingredients.

I prefer a blend of 3 cheeses. One is a fresh hard cheese (not boxed or pregrated), such as Romano, Asiago, Parmesan, or Sonoma dry Jack. The second is a good "melter," such as mozzarella, Monterey Jack, Cheddar, or Gruyère. The third can be any favorite, including some version of blue cheese. I grate or shred them with 1 part hard cheese to 2 parts "melter" and 1 part optional. Then I mix in a few teaspoons of a variety of dried or fresh herbs and spices, such as basil, oregano, thyme, _herbes de Provence,_ black pepper, and granulated or fresh garlic. This blend gives the cheese a more interesting appearance and boosts the herbal flavor of the sauce.

The dough does not need a "lip," but one inevitably occurs because the edge is usually thicker than the center and it doesn't have any sauce to hold it down. Do not try to build up the edge by crimping—you want it to bubble up on its own and create a light, airy crumb.

## Poolish Baguettes

BREAD PROFILE:

_Lean, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 3 to 4 hours _poolish_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _poolish;_ 12 to 15 minutes mixing; 4 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 25 minutes baking

Bernard Ganachaud, in the early 1960s, made the _poolish_ baguette the first legitimate alternative to the 60-2-2 baguette of the Parisian masses. When he retired thirty years later, his _la flûte Gana_ was a licensed commodity, and bakers who paid for the right to make it were allowed to charge an extra franc above the government-controlled price. In the Coupe du Monde bread competition, the _poolish_ baguette is now the standard that all countries must replicate. In my visits to the _boulangeries_ of Paris, the _poolish_ baguette made at the original Ganachaud Boulangerie was the second best baguette I ever had (the first being the _pain à l'ancienne_ of Philippe Gosselin). Ganachaud has a special medium-extraction flour (with his name prominently displayed on the bags, naturally) from which he makes his baguettes, and there isn't any flour quite like it in America. It is slightly higher in ash content and bran than regular bread flour, more like clear flour (whole-wheat flour that has been sifted only once instead of the usual twice to remove the bran and germ). The closest I've come to replicating that flour is described below and it makes a wonderful baguette, perhaps as good as can be done outside of the magical environment of Paris and without true Ganachaud-endorsed flour. Some people prefer it to the Gosselin baguette. See what you think.

Makes 3 small baguettes

1 cup (7 ounces) _poolish_

1¾ cups (8 ounces) whole-wheat flour, sifted (see Commentary)

2 cups (9 ounces) unbleached bread or all-purpose flour

1½ teaspoons (.37 ounce) salt

¾ teaspoon (.08 ounce) instant yeast

1⅛ to 1¼ cups (9 to 10 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the _poolish_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill. Pass the whole-wheat flour through a sifter or a strainer, sifting out the bran. Sift as much of the flour through the strainer as will go and set aside the bran that remains in the strainer for another application—perhaps Multigrain Bread Extraordinaire or _Pain de Campagne_.

**2. Stir together the flours, salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _poolish_ pieces and 1⅛ cups of the water and stir with a large spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. Add more water or flour as needed to create a dough that is soft but not sticky.

**3. Sprinkle bread flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for about 10 minutes (or 6 minutes by machine), sprinkling in more bread flour if needed. The dough should be soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size. Remove the dough and knead it lightly for 1 minute. Return the dough to the bowl and cover it again.

**5. Ferment for an additional 2 hours at room temperature;** the dough should double in size.

**6. Lightly sprinkle flour on the counter** and gently transfer the dough to the counter. Divide it into 3 equal pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife, being careful to degas it as little as possible. Shape the pieces into baguettes, and prepare them for proofing by either the _couche_ or parchment methods.

**7. Proof the baguettes at room temperature for 50 to 60 minutes,** or until they grow to about 1½ times their original size and are still slightly springy to the touch.

**8.Prepare your oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Score the baguettes.

**9. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the dough pieces to the peel or pan. Transfer the baguettes to the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Check the bread at this point and rotate 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Continue baking for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the loaves are a rich golden brown and register at least 205°F in the center. If they seem to be getting too dark before reaching this temperature, reduce the oven to 350°F (or turn it off) and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.

**10. Remove the bread from the oven** and cool on a rack for at least 40 minutes before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

This formula calls for sifted whole-wheat flour, but many people don't have sieves fine enough to filter out the bran (what we're trying to do is approximate the grade of flour known as clear flour). If your whole-wheat flour goes through the sifter without leaving behind a substantial amount of bran, replace all but 2 tablespoons of the whole-wheat flour with an equal amount of regular bread flour. The 2 tablespoons of whole-wheat flour will provide about the right amount of fiber and ash.

It's always easiest to make the _poolish_ the day before (or up to 3 days in advance), and then pull it out of the refrigerator an hour before you need it. However, you can also make it the same day as the final dough, as long as you make it about 4 hours in advance to give it plenty of time to bubble up and ferment.

It never hurts to add some old dough, _pâte fermentée,_ if you have any hanging around from previous projects, in addition to the _poolish_ (no other adjustments are necessary since _pâte fermentée_ is a complete formula unto itself). I've added up to 50 percent (in the recipe below that would equal about 8 ounces) and found that it reduces fermentation time by about 20 percent without any loss in flavor. In fact, some people like it even better than with _poolish_ alone.

_Portuguese Sweet Bread_

## Portuguese Sweet Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

_Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_60 to 90 minutes sponge; 15 minutes mixing; 5 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 50 to 60 minutes baking_

Now that I'm living on the East Coast, I am in the center of Portuguese sweet bread universe. When I lived in California, I knew it as Hawaiian bread, but upon closer reading of the label, I learned that even the Hawaiians give credit to the Portuguese for this big, soft, sweet, round pillow of a loaf.

One man I know from Los Angeles who summers on Nantucket told me he was in love with the sandwiches made on this bread from a small shop on the island. He was the first person I met with the same passion for this bread that many people feel toward rustic and wild-yeast breads of the artisan movement. When I began teaching at Johnson & Wales University, I found that each of my classes included at least one student who shared my friend's passion for the sweet bread. Each of these students vows to improve upon the general formula, and this version is a result of the many tweakings the students who grew up with the real deal gave to the original version in an effort to make it conform to their childhood memories.

The most distinctive aspect of this bread, besides the softness and the shape, is the flavor imparted by the powdered milk. I have tried making versions with whole milk and buttermilk, but once you get the taste of the powdered-milk version in your mind, no other taste will do.

Makes two 1-pound loaves

**SPONGE**

½ cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) granulated sugar

2¼ teaspoons (.25 ounce) instant yeast

½ cup (4 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DOUGH**

6 tablespoons (3 ounces) granulated sugar

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

¼ cup (1.25 ounces) powdered milk (DMS)

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) unsalted butter, at room temperature

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) vegetable shortening

2 large (3.3 ounces) eggs

1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) lemon extract

1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) orange extract

1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) vanilla extract

3 cups (13.5 ounces) unbleached bread flour

About 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) water, at room temperature

**EGG WASH**

1 egg, whisked with 1 teaspoon water until frothy

**1. To make the sponge, stir together the flour, sugar, and yeast** in a small bowl. Add the water and stir until all the ingredients are hydrated and make a smooth batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the sponge gets foamy and seems on the verge of collapse.

**2. To make the dough,** combine the sugar, salt, powdered milk, butter, and shortening in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or the bowl of an electric mixer). Cream together with a sturdy spoon (or the paddle attachment) until smooth, then mix in the eggs and the extracts. Knead by hand (or switch to the dough hook attachment) and mix in the sponge and the flour. Add the water, as needed, to make a very soft dough. The finished dough should be very supple and soft, easy to knead, and not wet or sticky. It will take 10 to 12 minutes with the electric mixer and close to 15 minutes by hand to achieve this consistency. (Dough with high amounts of fat and sugar usually takes longer to knead because the gluten requires more time to set up.) The finished dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**4. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 equal pieces.** Form each of the pieces into a _boule_. Lightly oil two 9-inch pie pans and place 1 _boule,_ seam side down, in each pan. Mist the dough with spray oil and loosely cover the pans with plastic wrap.

**5. Proof at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours,** or until the dough fills the pans fully, doubling in size and overlapping the edges slightly. (If you only want to bake 1 loaf, you may retard the second in the refrigerator for 1 day, although it will take 4 to 5 hours to proof after it comes out of the refrigerator.)

**6. Very gently brush the loaves with the egg wash.** Preheat the oven to 350°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf.

**7. Bake the loaves for 50 to 60 minutes,** or until they register 190°F in the center. After 30 minutes, check the loaves and rotate 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Because of the high amount of sugar, the dough will brown very quickly, but don't be fooled into thinking it is done. It will get darker as the center gradually catches up with the outside, but it will not burn. The final color will be a rich mahogany brown.

**8. Remove the bread from the pie pans and place on a rack to cool.** The bread will soften as it cools, resulting in a very soft, squishy loaf. Allow the bread to cool for at least 90 minutes before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

In addition to sandwiches and snack bread, one of the great uses for Portuguese sweet bread is French toast. It is very addictive. It also is ideal for bread pudding.

_Potato Rosemany Bread_

## Potato Rosemary Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

_Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

**_Day 1:_ 2½ to 4 hours _biga_**

**_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _biga;_ 12 minutes mixing; 4 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 45 minutes baking**

Rosemary has become a popular herb as culinary interest has grown and many of us have discovered how easy it is to cultivate it in our kitchen or backyard. It also has been overused, or used with a heavy hand in some instances, so I always advise restraint with rosemary: a little goes a long way.

The Italians call this bread _panmarino,_ and it is to them that we owe thanks for this interesting concept. This bread is a good one for answering the question, What do I do with these leftover mashed potatoes? The potato starch softens the dough and gives the bread a pleasing tenderness, while the dough delivers other bold flavors from the _biga_ and rosemary infusion.

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 18 dinner rolls

1¼ cups (7 ounces) _biga_

3 cups plus 2 tablespoons (14 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

¼ teaspoon (.03 ounce) black pepper, coarsely ground (optional)

1¼ teaspoons (.14 ounce) instant yeast

1 cup (6 ounces) mashed potatoes

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) olive oil

2 tablespoons (.25 ounce) coarsely chopped fresh rosemary

¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons to 1 cup (7 to 8 ounces) water, at room temperature (or warm if the potatoes are cold)

4 tablespoons (1 ounce) coarsely chopped roasted garlic (optional)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

Olive oil for brushing on top

**1. Remove the _biga_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before you plan to make the bread. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flour, salt, black pepper** , and yeast into a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _biga_ pieces, mashed potatoes, oil, rosemary, and ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons water. Stir with a large spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) for 1 minute, or until the ingredients form a ball. Add more water, if necessary, or more flour, if the dough is too sticky.

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for approximately 10 minutes (or 6 minutes by machine), adding more flour if needed, until the dough is soft and supple, tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Flatten the dough and spread the roasted garlic over the top. Gather the dough into a ball and knead it by hand for 1 minute (you will probably have to dust it with flour first to absorb the moisture from the garlic). Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl** and divide it into 2 equal pieces for loaves, or 18 equal pieces (about 2 ounces each) for dinner rolls. Shape each of the larger pieces into a _boule_, or shape the smaller pieces into rolls. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment (use 2 pans for rolls) and dust lightly with semolina flour or cornmeal. Place the dough on the parchment, separating the pieces so that they will not touch, even after they rise. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

**6. Proof at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours** (depending on the size of the pieces), or until the dough doubles in size.

**7. Preheat the oven to 400°F** with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Remove the plastic from the dough and lightly brush the breads or rolls with olive oil. You do not need to score these breads, but you can if you prefer.

**8. Place the pan(s) in the oven.** Bake the loaves for 20 minutes, then rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking. The loaves will take 35 to 45 minutes total to bake. Bake the rolls for 10 minutes, rotate the pans, and then bake for 10 minutes longer. The loaves and rolls will be a rich golden brown all around, and the internal temperature should register at least 195°F. The loaves should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom. If the loaves or rolls are fully colored but seem too soft, turn off the oven and let them bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes to firm up.

**9. Remove the finished loaves or rolls from the oven** and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour for loaves and 20 minutes for rolls before serving.

_COMMENTARY_

You can attractively garnish this bread by embossing a sprig of fresh rosemary in the top of the loaf. Mist the dough just after the final shaping with water and lay the sprig flat so that it adheres fully. Don't leave any of the needles hanging in the air, as they will burn during the baking stage without the protection of the dough.

_Pugliese_

## Pugliese

BREAD PROFILE:

_Lean, rustic dough; indirect method; commercial yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 2½ to 4 hours _biga_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _biga;_ 7 minutes mixing; 4½ to 5 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 30 minutes baking

Pugliese refers to the southeastern Italian region of Apulia (Puglia in Italian), but the variations on loaves with this name are endless. Many of the versions I've seen in the United States are similar to ciabatta—sometimes they actually _are_ ciabatta, but are called pugliese just to differentiate them from the competition. What is the same is that both of these breads, along with many others, fall into the category of rustic breads, which we define as hydration in excess of 65 percent, usually approaching 80 percent. In Italy, where the flour is naturally more extensible than the very elastic North American flour that we use, there is no need to overhydrate. But here we need to pump more water into the dough in order to stretch the gluten strands, giving the loaves their distinctive big-hole structure and delicious nutlike flavor.

One distinction between ciabatta, which originated in the Lake Como region of Lombardy (northern Italy), and pugliese is that pugliese breads are usually baked in rounds rather than in the slipper shape of ciabatta. The French version of a rustic bread, _pain rustique,_ is also slightly elongated, but more of a _bâtard_ than a slipper shape. Those, along with the _pain à l'ancienne_ baguette and the very elongated _stirato_ and stubby _pain rustique_ (pictured here, made from the ciabatta dough), are all rustic breads, each with its own shape and ingredient makeup. An important distinction of the true pugliese bread, and one not often seen in American versions, is the use of golden durum flour, finely milled and packaged as fancy or extra fancy durum flour. Fancy durum is milled from the same strain of durum wheat as the sandy semolina flour that is sprinkled underneath hearth loaves and used in _pane siciliano_ , but it is milled more finely.

There are bakeries in Apulia that make this bread with 100 percent fancy durum flour and some that use a blend of durum and regular bread flours. In the following formula, I suggest a blend, but feel free to play around with the proportions, moving even into a 100 percent durum version when you feel adventurous. The challenge for anyone tackling this bread is getting comfortable with wet dough. Once you do, you will find it difficult to resist the desire to make rustic bread all the time; the softness and pliability of the dough give it a wonderful feeling in the hand. Combined with the flavor enhancement of long fermentation, this formula brings forth a loaf that is so dramatic, so delicious, and so much fun to make that it will forever change your standard of what constitutes great bread.

Makes two 1-pound loaves

2 cups (10.8 ounces) _biga_

2¼ cups (10 ounces) fancy or extra fancy durum flour and unbleached bread flour, in any combination (such as a 50-50 blend)

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

¼ cup (2 ounces) mashed potatoes (optional)

1 to 1⅛ cups (8 to 9 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the _biga_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or a serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _biga_ pieces, mashed potatoes, and 1 cup of the water. (If you are using all bread flour instead of durum, start with ¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons water.) Using a large metal spoon (or on low speed with the paddle attachment), mix until the ingredients form a wet, sticky ball. If there is still some loose flour, add the additional water as needed and continue to mix.

**3. If you aremixing by hand,** repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand. Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. **If you are using an electric mixer,** switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or for as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is still very sticky against the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in a little more flour (either type) until it clears the sides. Don't be alarmed if the dough seems very sticky. The wetter it is, the better the final bread will be.

**4. Sprinkle enough bread flour on the counter** to make a bed about 8 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the dough to the bed of flour and proceed with the stretch-and-fold method. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.

**5. Let rest for 30 minutes.** Repeat the stretch-and-fold method and again mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. (Each time you repeat this process, the dough will become stronger, more elastic, and less sticky.)

**6. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl.** For the third time, repeat the stretch-and-fold technique. With a spatula dipped in water, transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment the dough at room temperature for 2 hours, undisturbed.

**7. Generously dust the counter with flour.** Remove the plastic wrap and, with hands and a bowl scraper dipped in flour, transfer the dough to the counter, taking care not to degas the dough any more than necessary. With a metal pastry scraper that has been dipped into flour, or a serrated knife dusted with flour, divide the dough into 2 pieces. Again dipping your hands into flour, gently shape the dough pieces into 2 _boules_. Let them relax, seam-side down, on the counter for a few minutes while you prepare the proofing bowls.

**8.Prepare 2 proofing bowls**, making sure to coat with spray oil and generously dust the entire surface of the cloth with flour. Gently transfer the dough, seam side up, into each of the bowls. If the seam opens up, pinch it closed. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the bowls with the flaps of the cloth.

**9. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until the dough has expanded to about 1½ times its original size.

**10.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F.

**11. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal, and gently transfer the dough to the peel or pan by carefully turning each bowl over onto the peel, lifting off the bowl, and then carefully peeling off the cloth. The dough will spread out on the peel or pan. With a sharp razor blade or French _lame,_ score the loaves with a pound (#) sign. Transfer the dough to the baking stone (or bake on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door again. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 15 minutes. Check the loaves at this point and rotate 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Continue baking for 5 to 15 minutes, or until the breads are a deep golden brown and register about 205°F in the center.

**12. Remove the loaves from the oven** and transfer them to a cooling rack. The crusts will soften somewhat as they cool. Allow the loaves to cool for at least 40 minutes before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

If you do not have fancy durum flour, you can substitute semolina flour, but use only one-third as much as the formula calls for and replace the rest with an equal amount of either unbleached high-gluten or bread flour. You can also make this without any durum or semolina by using only high-gluten or bread flour.

This dough is yeasted and also boosted by a _biga_ pre-ferment, but you can make a wild-yeast, mixed-method version by replacing the _biga_ with an equal amount of firm sourdough starter.

Because it is so wet, this dough is well-suited to mixing in a food processor.

Another ingredient that shows up in some versions of pugliese is mashed potato. A small amount adds a nice flavor and tenderizes the bread because of the potato starch. In this formula it is an optional ingredient; if you use it, you may have to increase the flour to compensate for the added moisture. Be sure to use mashed potatoes that have already been seasoned with salt, such as those left over from dinner.

The amount of water in the final dough will be determined greatly by the particular type and brand of flour you choose. Durum flour, in any form, tends to absorb more water than bread flour, so use the amount below only as a guideline and starting point. Be prepared to adjust as the dough demands.

_GRACE NOTE_   Bruschetta

Along with _grissini_ (breadsticks), bruschetta, or sliced, toasted, and topped bread, has become a worldwide food trend. Bruschetta is yet another great Italian variation of pizza—that is, crust with topping. So much has been written about how to make so-called authentic bruschetta that I will add only a few comments to the canon.

You can use almost any kind of bread, but the best bread to use is rustic bread, like ciabatta or pugliese, with big holes and an easy-to-crisp texture. Slice it medium-thin, brush it with olive oil (garlic infused, if you like, or use garlic butter), and toast it under a broiler or in a sauté pan over medium-high heat until crisp. Then top it with your favorite topping, the most popular being fresh chopped tomatoes marinated in chopped fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil, coarse salt, and pepper. Another option is to simply rub a slice of the bread with a clove of garlic, and then toast it.

You can return the topped slices to the broiler if you want to melt cheese or heat up the topping.

There are no rules governing toppings except one, the classic culinary law: flavor rules.

Smoked eggplant purée is a topping that we love at home. To make it, buy 3 or 4 large eggplants and fire up a charcoal grill (this will not work as well on a gas grill, since you need the intense heat of hot coals). When the coals turn white, lay the whole, uncut eggplants on the grill about 5 inches above the coals. Turn them every 10 minutes, grilling until the outsides are charred and the insides are a soft mush. This will take 40 to 60 minutes. It is important that the eggplants grill until they become very mushy. Transfer them to a brown paper bag and close the bag to let them steam. When they are cool enough to handle, after 20 to 30 minutes, cut them open. Working with one at a time, scoop the soft interior eggplant flesh into a bowl. Discard the charred skin, the hard core, and any large seed sacs. Season the flesh with fresh lemon juice (about 2 tablespoons per eggplant), extra virgin olive oil (about 1 tablespoon per eggplant), and coarse salt to taste (start with ½ teaspoon per eggplant and increase from there). Purée this mixture in a food processor, adjusting the salt and lemon juice to taste. Black pepper or ground cayenne pepper can be added to taste. This makes a very smoky, lively dip, perfect for spreading on bruschetta and serving either cold or warm.

Note: Some people with gas stoves smoke the eggplants by turning them at 3-minute intervals over a gas burner, resting the eggplant against the grate as it chars. This is a messy but viable alternative to grilling over hot coals.

## SOURDOUGH BREAD AND VARIATIONS

What we call sourdough bread should more correctly be called wild-yeast bread, as it is natural wild yeast that leavens the loaf and not all wild-yeast breads taste sour. More importantly, as explained in the fermentation section, it is not even the wild yeast that makes the bread sour, but the acids produced by the various bacteria that inhabit the dough. These acids lower the pH level of the dough, creating a wake of flavors in the process, most notably the distinctive sourness we associate with sourdough bread. This is the microbial world, quite active beyond our sight, constantly changing the medium, the bread dough in which the organisms live.

There are dozens of valid methods for making wild-yeast breads, and every bakery has its own system. Some use a six-build system in which the starter is fed on a very specific schedule at precise times with precise temperatures, building (also called elaborating) the dough into larger and larger volumes until the last "build" serves as the starter for the final dough. These various builds, or elaborations, affect both flavor and structure. Some bakeries use only a simple two-build system, using a large portion (25 to 35 percent) of the previous batch of final dough as the starter for the next batch. Some systems use a wet-sponge _poolish-_ like starter, while others use a firm _biga-_ like starter, or any combination thereof. Many systems use a combination of wild yeast and commercial yeast (called spiking the dough), to create a hybrid loaf that is flavorful but faster rising and not too sour. Some bakeries use different systems for different breads (firm starter for one, sponge starter for another, spiked method for another), while other bakeries use a single master system and apply it to all of their breads. In other words, no single rule governs how to make wild-yeast bread. I teach my students to first learn one system well and then feel free to learn as many systems as they want until they find the one that suits them best.

_My favorite sourdough variation is awalnut bread with blue cheese._

The wonderful village-style bakeries that now grace so many communities have introduced some beautiful and delicious variations of wild-yeast breads. They include multigrain variations; breads made with flavorful supplementary ingredients, such as roasted garlic, onions, potatoes, rosemary, and other herbs; and also wild-yeast rustic loaves made from wet dough (such as the wild-yeast pugliese variation). When we examine the art and science behind these loaves, we discover that each is made by the baker's chosen system and by his or her creative choice of ingredient variation. Again, each system involves choices: percentage of starter to use, method of starter, fermentation times and temperature, supplementary ingredients and design, and different blends of flours.

The following master system, like the one in my earlier book, _Crust & Crumb,_ utilizes a three-build method. This system, however, uses a smaller percentage of wild-yeast starter and allows for greater variation in application. I still use both systems when I bake and teach. I love the chewy texture and flavor complexity of the _Crust & Crumb_ sourdough (after all, I won a national bread competition with it), but I also appreciate the flexibility of the new system.

I would be remiss if I did not also say that if you already follow a system, whether self-taught or learned from another of the many excellent baking books available, you can apply the same principles to that system as you do to this one. That is, you can be creative. A particular system of builds will produce subtle flavor or texture distinctions that differ from those of another system, but both systems, assuming they follow sound bread-baking science, will produce wonderful bread. In most instances, my starter in someone else's system should work as well as theirs, and vice versa. It is the thesis of this book that once armed with the empowerment tools of bread baking—knowledge and information—you should be able to navigate the infinite options available to you. The broad strokes of the following formula can be used to make an unlimited number of recipe variations. The finer strokes of these variations will be addressed at the end of the formula.

Bear in mind that this system is designed for home baking and takes into consideration that home bakers do not have a crew to whom they can pass on feeding schedules. Very few people, for instance, have climate-controlled proof boxes that produce consistent results day after day. We fly without such a safety net (and so do many professional artisan bakers, by choice), but we still have the power to manipulate time and temperature to create amazing bread. The use of refrigeration is a modern invention not available to the great bakers of previous centuries. They did their manipulations by scrupulous attention to feeding cycles. Cold fermentation gives us a wider berth and a greater margin of error, and allows us to call our shots regarding when to take the next step in the twelve-stage process of bread making.

The following method will work with either organic or commercial flour and produces a mother starter, what I fondly call the barm, in 5 to 6 days, depending on the weather.

Note: I have updated the original seed culture to account for a strain of leuconostoc bacteria that hinders many starters but generates lots of carbon dioxide in the early stage of a seed culture starter, making it seem that the wild yeast cells are growing rapidly. I learned from a group of dedicated home bakers (all contributors to the King Arthur Flour Baker's Circle website) that the bacteria can be defeated by using pineapple juice on the first two days.

###  Seed Culture

**DAY 1**

1 cup (4.25 ounces) dark rye or coarse whole rye (pumpernickel-grind) flour

½ cup (4 ounces) unsweetened pineapple juice, at room temperature

**DAY 2**

½ cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

¼ cup (2 ounces) unsweetened pineapple juice, at room temperature

**DAY 3**

1 cup (4.5 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

½ cup (4 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DAY 4**

1 cup (4.5 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

½ cup (4 ounces) water, at room temperature

**Day 1:** Mix the flour and juice together in a bowl until they form a ball of dough. Do not worry if the dough is stiff or soft, but be sure that all the flour is hydrated. Press this piece of dough into a 4-cup measuring beaker and place a piece of tape on the beaker to mark the top of the dough. Cover the beaker with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature for 24 hours.

**Day 2:** The dough should not have risen much, if at all, during this time. In a mixing bowl, combine the Day 2 ingredients with the Day 1 sponge, mixing with your hand or a spoon until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. The dough will be somewhat softer and wetter than the Day 1 sponge. Return this to the beaker, pressing it down, and replace the old tape with a new piece of tape to mark the spot. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 24 hours at room temperature. Do not be put off by the strong aroma of the dough; it will eventually brighten.

**Day 3:** Check to see if there has been a rise in the dough. There will probably be some fermentation but not a lot, perhaps a 50 percent rise. Regardless, discard half of the starter (or give it to a friend to cultivate), and mix the remaining half with the Day 3 ingredients. It will be a little wetter. Again, return it to the beaker. It should press down to the same height as on Day 2. Re-tape the beaker to mark the top of the dough, cover, and ferment for 24 hours.

**Day 4:** The sponge should have at least doubled in size; more is even better. If it is still sluggish and hasn't doubled in size, allow it to sit out for another 12 to 24 hours. Otherwise, discard half of the starter and mix the remaining half with the new ingredients, returning it to the beaker as before. Cover and ferment until it at least doubles in size. This may take 4 to 24 hours. It is okay if it triples in size, but because it is now fairly soft and spongelike, it will not be able to sustain that large of a rise without falling. If it falls easily when you tap the beaker, that is the sign that your seed culture is ready to be turned into a barm, or mother starter.

_COMMENTARY_

Before embarking on the wild-yeast adventure, be sure to review the discussion All About Wild Yeast and Bacterial Fermentation.

If you want to make a pure rye starter for 100 percent rye bread (rather than convert a regular starter as shown in most of the following rye-bread formulas), you can substitute white rye flour wherever the steps call for high-gluten or bread flour.

You can also make this seed culture with wheat flour alone, replacing the dark rye of Day 1 with unbleached bread flour or whole-wheat flour. I find that the rye adds a more complex flavor and sort of jump-starts the process, but in the end the seed culture will develop regardless of the flour you use.

If you do not have pineapple juice or want to try using water, use filtered or spring water. You can also substitute orange juice or even lemon juice. The starter may or may not stay on the predicted feeding schedule, depending on the presence or absence of leuconostoc bacteria in your flour. About 30% to 40% of starters end up with the leuconostoc problem, depending on the growing conditions in the wheat and rye fields that year. However, if you aerate the starter a few times each day, the starter will eventually overcome any leuconostoc even without pineapple juice.

### Barm

Makes approximately 6 cups (2½ pounds) barm

3½ cups (16 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

2 cups (16 ounces) water, at room temperature

1 cup (7 ounces) seed culture

**Stir together the flour, water, and seed culture in a mixing bowl** (you can discard the remaining seed culture or give it to a friend to build into his or her own barm). Make sure the seed culture is evenly distributed and all the flour is hydrated. It will make a wet, sticky sponge similar to a _poolish_. Transfer this sponge to a clean plastic, glass, or ceramic storage container twice as large as the barm. When transferring the barm into the container, repeatedly dip your hand, spatula, or bowl scraper in water to keep the barm from sticking to it. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for approximately 6 hours, or until the barm is bubbly. The plastic wrap will swell like a balloon, as will a plastic lid. When this happens, open the lid or release the plastic to let the gas escape (try not to breathe it as it escapes—the carbonic gas mixed with ethanol fumes will knock you across the room!). Replace the cover and refrigerate overnight before using. The barm will be ready to use the next day and will remain potent for 3 days. After that, or if you use more than half during the next 3 days, you will need to refresh it as described next.

_COMMENTARY_

Opinions are divided as to whether the pineapple juice is really necessary after Phase 1. It probably is not, but it won't hurt to use it during Phase 2 and may, in some instances, serve as insurance against the appearance of leuconostoc bacteria.

The full flavor of the barm will not develop until it has been refreshed 2 or 3 times over a 2-week period, during which time the organisms indigenous to your region will gradually take charge of it. (This is why a starter made from a seed culture imported from Egypt or Russia will, over time, produce bread that tastes like a starter made locally from scratch.) When the barm reaches its peak flavor, you will be able to maintain that flavor with periodic refreshments. However, you can begin using the barm the day after it is made. The leavening power will be strong from the first, since the wild yeast ferments the barm at a faster pace than the bacteria produce their flavorful acids.

If you want to save the barm but do not plan to make bread for a while, you can refrigerate it for at least 2 months in an airtight container, and then refresh it by discarding all but 1 cup and building up from there. Or, you can freeze the barm for up to 6 months and then defrost it in the refrigerator 3 days before you need it. When it has thawed enough to use (the next day), discard all but ½ cup and refresh as described at left. Then refresh again the next day, building back to about 4 to 6 cups barm. The following day you will have a strong, ready-to-use barm. Of course, you still have 2 more days of dough building to accomplish, as described in the formulas.

## _Refreshing theBarm_

  * **The standard refreshment for barm is to double it at least.** However, you can also quadruple it, as the organisms in the barm are capable of feeding on a large refreshment and converting it into starter. I double the barm at each feeding if I want a very sour bread, but I triple or quadruple it when I want a less sour flavor. Remember, it takes longer for the bacteria to work than the yeast, so while a larger feeding dilutes both the bacterial and the wild-yeast communities, the yeast bounces back faster than the bacteria, creating a strong, but less acidic, leavening sponge. Eventually, the bacterial fermentation does catch up, by the second or third day, and the sponge becomes quite acidic and sour (with a pH level of about 3.5).
  * **It is important to understand what happens when you refresh the barm.** After 4 to 7 days, the acids and protease enzymes in a barm that has not been refreshed break down the gluten, turning what was at first a strong, stringy sponge into a protein-weak, potato-soup–like consistency. There are still plenty of live organisms to leaven and flavor bread, but they will make a flaccid dough. For this reason, it is advisable to feed your barm 3 days or less before you plan to use it (ideally, the day before). If you have a lot of barm but haven't fed it for a while, discard all but 1 cup and refresh it with 4 cups of flour and 2½ to 3 cups water, stirring until all the flour is hydrated.
  * **If you have been using and feeding your barm regularly,** you do not necessarily have to discard any. However, what you do not want to do is, for example, use 1 cup of barm from your supply to make some bread, then refresh the remaining barm with only 1 cup flour and some water. You must always at least double the remaining barm. You can do this by either throwing or giving some away before you refresh it, or using up more before refreshing it (remember, you have a 3-day window before you need to feed it again).
  * **If you do not plan to use the barm for a while,** do not throw any away until you plan to refresh it again, and follow the guidance given above to refrigerate or freeze it in a tightly sealed container. Since you do not want to freeze a glass or ceramic container, you should transfer the barm to a zippered freezer bag that has been misted with spray oil (allow enough room for expansion and gas development).
  * **Use high-gluten flour for the refreshments** (except in the case of a rye barm), as it has more gluten than in bread flour to withstand the acid and enzymatic degradation.
  * **You can refresh in two ways.** One is to weigh the amount of barm you plan to refresh and the other is to eyeball it. I use both methods and find that as long as you stay in the doubling to quadrupling ballpark, you will have no problem keeping your mother strong, active, and clean tasting. By clean tasting I mean that no off-flavors develop, such as a musty or cheesy flavor caused by overfermenting at warm temperatures or by leaving it out too long. This allows unwelcome bacteria to join the party or for the yeast to create too much alcohol, resulting in what we think of as a yeasty flavor. The flavor is a combination of alcohol and glutathione, an unpleasant-tasting amino acid released by yeast as it dies.
  * **The weighing method is simple:** Weigh the barm and calculate how much flour and water it will take to double, triple, or quadruple the weight (the easiest way is to figure equal parts water and flour). Thus, if you plan to refresh 1 pound of barm, you can build it to 2 pounds by adding 8 ounces each of flour (1¾ cups) and water (1 cup); or you can quadruple it by adding 1½ pounds flour (5¼ cups) and 1½ pounds (3 cups) water. The larger the refreshment, the longer the fermentation time, usually 4 to 6 hours, depending on the size of the refreshment and how cold the barm was when you started. If you are using a cold barm just out of the refrigerator, warm the water up to about 90°F to compensate and to hasten the onset of fermentation. Never let the starter actually be warm, however. It is best for the organisms we want to cultivate, the lactic- and acetic-producing bacteria, if the starter ferments slowly, between 65° and 75°F, or at room temperature.
  * **When the starter is bubbly and foamy, put it in the refrigerator overnight before using it.** Technically, though, you could begin using it as soon as it foams up, but I wait for the overnight development because I believe it gives the bread more complexity of flavor. Either way, with a ripe and ready barm, you are ready to move on to the next build.

_The barm, or mother starter (back), is a wet sponge similar to a_ poolish, _while the firm starter, or_ levain, _is about the same texture as a_ biga _or French bread dough._

##  Basic Sourdough Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Lean, standard dough; indirect method; wild yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2 OR 3

_Day 1:_ 5 hours firm starter

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill firm starter; 15 to 17 minutes mixing; 5 to 7 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 30 minutes baking (day 2 or 3)

Makes two 1½-pound loaves

**FIRM STARTER**

⅔ cup (4 ounces) barm

1 cup (4.5 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

⅛ to ¼ cup (1 to 2 ounces) water

**FINAL DOUGH**

4½ cups (20.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour, or other flour combination

2 teaspoons (.5 ounce) salt

1½ to 1¾ cups (12 to 14 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the barm from the refrigerator** and measure it out 1 hour before making the firm starter to take off the chill. To do this, dip a ⅔-cup measuring cup into a bowl of water, then scoop it into the barm to fill (the wet cup will allow the barm to slide out easily). Transfer it to a small bowl, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and allow it to warm up for 1 hour.

**2. Add the flour to the bowl and mix together the barm and the flour,** adding only enough additional water so that you can knead this into a small ball, about the texture of French bread dough. You do not need to work this very long, just until all the flour is hydrated and the barm is evenly distributed. Lightly oil a small bowl or mist the inside of a plastic bag with spray oil, and place the starter in the bowl or bag, turning to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl or seal the bag.

**3. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 4 hours,** or until the starter has at least doubled in size. If it takes more time than 4 hours, give it additional time, checking every hour or so. Then, put it into the refrigerator overnight.

**4. Remove the starter from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Mist with spray oil, cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**5. To make the dough, stir together the flour and salt in a 4-quart mixing bowl** (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the starter pieces and enough water to bring everything together into a ball as you stir with a large metal spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment).

**6. Sprinkle the counter with flour,** transfer the dough to the counter, and knead by hand for 12 to 15 minutes (or mix with the dough hook for 4 minutes on medium-low speed, allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes, and then mix for 4 minutes). Adjust the water or flour as needed. The dough should be firm but tacky, like firm French bread dough. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**7. Ferment at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours,** or until the dough has nearly doubled in size.

**8. Gently remove the dough from the bowl** and divide it into 2 equal pieces (about 22 ounces each), or divide it into smaller pieces if you are making rolls, being careful to degas the dough as little as possible. Gently shape the dough into _boules, bâtards,_ or baguettes.

**9.Proof the dough** in _bannetons_ or proofing bowls, on _couches,_ or on parchment-lined sheet pans that have been dusted with semolina flour or cornmeal. Regardless of the method, mist the exposed part of the dough with spray oil and loosely cover the dough with a towel or plastic wrap, or slip the pans into a food-grade plastic bag. At this point you can either proof the loaves for 2 to 3 hours, or retard overnight in the refrigerator. If retarding, remove them from the refrigerator approximately 4 hours before you plan to bake them.

**10.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have a steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Carefully remove the towel or plastic wrap from the dough, or slip the pan from the bag, 10 minutes before baking.

**11. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal and gently transfer the dough to the peel or pan, carefully removing the cloth liner from the top of the dough for dough proofed in a bowl. (If the dough was proofed on a sheet pan, it can be baked directly on that pan.) Score the dough. Slide the dough onto a baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking for another 10 to 20 minutes, or until the loaves are done. They should register 205°F in the center, be a rich golden brown all over, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

**12. Transfer the finished loaves to a rack** and cool for at least 45 minutes before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

This dough is made with a 3-build method: barm to firm starter (also called the _levain_ or _chef_ ) to final dough. As noted earlier, this process could go on to 4, 5 or 6 builds, but by using cold fermentation (retarding), we develop maximum flavor without all the intermediate builds.

I encourage you to veer from this method and modify either the technique or the ingredients. Consult the Grace Note for a number of options, but only your imagination limits the full range of possibilities.

GRACE NOTE   Variations of Sourdough Ingredients and Methods

Some bakers prefer to work exclusively with firm starters, keeping even the mother starter in a firm state. Professional bakers like this because they can throw the firm piece easily into a mixer for either refreshing or elaborating. It is less messy than working with big batches of wet sponge. One of my baking friends, Keith Giusto of Giusto Mills in South San Francisco, keeps his mother starter as a very dry dough, like bagel dough. This is not only easy to transport and handle (assuming you have a mixer capable of handling such stiff dough), but also makes a very sour bread, for those who like it extra sour. Acetic bacteria prefer the denser, less-aerated environment of the firm starter; lactic bacteria prefer the wetter sponge of the barm method. Home bakers, I find, prefer keeping a wet sponge, as it is easy to refresh and keep track of it in small batches. However, if you prefer to use the firm starter system, simply reduce the water weight to 50 to 57 percent of the flour weight when you refresh your mother starter and then make your elaborations.

It is also perfectly acceptable to make your final dough directly from the barm. You will have to diminish the water in the final dough to compensate for the wetness of the barm, but otherwise you can proceed with an equal amount of barm for firm starter.

To spike the dough with commercial yeast, which guarantees a 90-minute first fermentation and a 60-minute final proofing (and a less sour flavor), add 1½ teaspoons instant yeast to the final dough.

You can substitute other types of flour, including whole-wheat flour, for some or all of the high-gluten or bread flour. A classic French _pain au levain_ includes about 10 percent whole-wheat or rye flour (or a combination—about ½ cup total).

You can make a _meteil_ rye bread (less than 50 percent rye flour), or a _seigle_ rye bread (more than 50 percent rye flour), by substituting the desired amount of rye flour, either white rye or a blend of white and pumpernickel grind. This can be done either in the final dough or in the firm starter (or you can use a rye barm—see the formula for 100% Sourdough Rye Bread).

You can add roasted garlic; lightly toasted walnuts, sunflower seeds, pecans, or other nuts and seeds of your choice; raisins and other dried fruit; or cheese. The standard amount is about 40 percent of the final flour weight. It is best to add these ingredients during the final 2 minutes of mixing to protect against breaking them up too small. My all-time favorite is a blue cheese and walnut bread with 25 percent toasted walnuts and 15 to 20 percent crumbled blue cheese (firm, not creamy), adding the walnuts during the last 2 minutes of kneading and carefully folding in the blue cheese by hand at the end of kneading. You can do this by flattening the dough and sprinkling one-third of the cheese over the top, then rolling it up and repeating this two more times until all the cheese is incorporated. If you are using salty cheese, such as blue, feta, or Parmesan, reduce the salt in the formula by 25 percent (to 1½ teaspoons). Incidentally, the oil from the walnuts will turn the dough a burgundy color and the delicious flavor of the walnuts will permeate the entire loaf.

Cooked potatoes can be used to tenderize and flavor the dough. Use a ratio of 25 percent potatoes to flour in the final build.

Fresh herbs can be used to taste. Hand roll them into the dough as you would blue cheese. Dried herbs and spices, such as _herbes de Provence,_ cumin, and oregano, can also be used, but with a gentle touch, as these flavors can easily dominate.

It is just as valid to make rustic, wet-dough breads with wild-yeast starters as it is to use commercial yeast and yeast pre-ferments, or to use the mixed, or spiked, method. Substitute an equal amount of barm (this is a perfect time to build the dough directly from barm) for the _poolish_. You can add commercial yeast (or not) during the final dough stage, bearing in mind that spiking it with yeast will allow you to make the bread on the same schedule as already written in the instructions. If you make pure wild-yeast bread, you will have to give the dough a 3- to 4-hour bulk fermentation and a 90-minute final proofing. You can make any of the rustic variations, from ciabatta to pugliese to focaccia, with this dough.

I grew up on two definitive deli sandwiches: roast beef, chicken fat _(schmaltz),_ and onion; and corned beef, coleslaw, and Russian dressing. Both sandwiches had to be served on onion rye to complete the experience. At least twice a month our family would head out to either Murray's Deli, Hymie's Deli, or the Chuckwagon on City Line Avenue (the delis are still there, but the Chuckwagon is long gone), and the big decision for me was which of the two sandwiches I should order. I never tired of either and years later, after emerging from a long vegetarian period, the first meat dish I sought out was a corned beef, coleslaw, and Russian dressing sandwich on onion rye. These days I limit my intake of corned beef, and especially of _schmaltz,_ but I still chronically yearn for those sandwiches. However, I do continue to enjoy onion rye whenever I can get my hands on some, often making it myself.

1 cup (8 ounces) buttermilk or milk, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

¼ to ½ cup (2 to 4 ounces) water, or as needed, at room temperature

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

1 egg white, whisked until frothy, for egg wash (optional)

**1. Make the starter a day ahead.** Mix together the barm, rye flour, and water in a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set it aside. Very lightly sauté the onions in the oil over medium heat just until they sweat. Transfer them out of the pan into a bowl and let them cool until they are warm, not hot. Stir them into the starter, re-cover with plastic wrap, and ferment at room temperature until it bubbles and foams, 3 to 4 hours. Refrigerate overnight.

**2. The next day, remove the starter from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.

**3. To make the dough,** stir together the flours, brown sugar, salt, yeast, and caraway seeds in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the starter, shortening, and buttermilk. Stir with a large metal spoon until the mixture forms a ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), adding in only as much water as it takes to bring everything together into a soft, not sticky mass. Let this sit for 5 minutes so the gluten can begin to develop.

**4. Sprinkle high-gluten or bread flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading the dough (or mix on medium-low speed with the dough hook). Add in flour as needed to make a firm, slightly tacky dough. Try to complete the kneading in 6 minutes (4 to 5 minutes by machine) to prevent the dough from getting gummy. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**5. Ferment at room temperature for 1½ to 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**6. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 or 3 equal pieces** (they will weigh about 30 ounces for larger loaves and 20 ounces for smaller loaves). Shape them into sandwich loaves or _bâtards_ for free-standing loaves. If you are baking them in loaf pans, lightly oil the pans (8½ by 4½-inch pans for small loaves; 9 by 5-inch pans for larger loaves). If you are baking them freestanding, line 1 or 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and dust with semolina flour or cornmeal. Transfer the shaped dough to the pans and mist the tops with spray oil.

**7. Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes,** or until they have grown 1½ times in size. The dough in the loaf pan should dome about 1 inch above the lip of the pans.

**8. Preheat the oven** to 350°F for loaf-pan breads, 400°F for freestanding loaves with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Brush freestanding loaves with the egg wash. You can score them, but this is optional. The egg wash is optional for loaf-pan breads. Place the loaf pans on a sheet pan before putting them into the oven (this protects the bottoms).

**9. Bake the loaves for 20 minutes,** rotate the pans 180 degrees for even baking, and continue to bake for 15 to 40 minutes, depending on the size and shape. The internal temperature should register 185° to 195°F at the center. The loaves should be golden brown all over and make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom.

**10. Remove the loaves from the pans** and transfer to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

The best rye breads are made with a mix of wild-yeast starter and commercial yeast. This is what makes them so flavorful. The addition of onions is optional; the bread is excellent with or without them, but I think the onions are integral to that true deli taste of memory.

Some people have never had rye bread without caraway seeds and as a result think that rye tastes like caraway. The caraway seeds are also optional here, and I suggest making this bread with and without them to determine which you prefer. Buttermilk tastes better than milk in this bread, but if you don't have any on hand, feel free to substitute whole or low-fat milk.

You can make these into what is called deli corn rye by proceeding as written and then misting the shaped loaves with water and rolling the tops (or the entire loaf) in medium-grind cornmeal. This gives the loaves a great corn crunch!

## _100% Sourdough Rye Bread_

BREAD PROFILE:

_Lean, standard dough; indirect method; wild yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2 OR 3

_Day 1:_ 4 to 5 hours firm rye starter and soaker

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill starter; 6 minutes mixing; 6 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 25 to 30 minutes baking

There are many ways to make rye bread, but very few versions contain 100 percent rye flour. Rye has so little of its unique type of gluten (6 to 8 percent) that it is hard to develop the structure and lift necessary for a decent crumb without the addition of a fair amount of high-gluten wheat flour. However, there are many people who love dense rye bread, and there are others who eat it because they can tolerate the gluten of this bread but not the gluten in wheat breads.

A lot of drama goes on inside a sourdough rye bread. Rye flour is high in natural sugars and dextrins and contains pentosan, a gum protein that causes the dough to become gummy if it is mixed as long as wheat breads. Also, the wild-yeast starter creates an acidic environment that slows down the enzymatic release of sugar during the mixing cycle, but at the same time allows for the sugars to emerge from the grain during the fermentation cycle as the enzyme activity kicks in. If properly mixed and fermented, the result is a sweet, creamy, yet chewy texture quite unlike that of any other bread.

Makes two 1-pound loaves

**FIRM RYE STARTER**

½ cup (3.5 ounces) barm or rye barm (see Commentary)

1 cup (4.5 ounces) white rye flour

About ¼ cup (2 ounces) water, at room temperature

**SOAKER**

½ cup (2 ounces) coarse whole-rye (pumpernickel-grind) flour, rye meal, or rye chops (cracked rye)

½ cup (4 ounces) water, at room temperature

**FINAL DOUGH**

3 cups (13.5 ounces) white rye flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

2 tablespoons (.5 ounce) caraway or other seeds (optional)

¾ to 1 cup (6 to 8 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

**1. The day before making the dough,** make the rye starter. Mix together the barm and rye flour in a bowl, adding only enough water to form a ball. It should be firm and a little tacky but not sticky or spongelike. Work quickly. It is not necessary to develop the gluten, only to hydrate all the flour and form a shaggy but firm dough. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the starter to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it lightly with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**2. Ferment at room temperature for 4 hours or longer,** or until the dough doubles in size (it will become softer and stickier as it rises). Refrigerate overnight.

**3. Also on the day before making the final dough,** make the soaker. Combine the coarse rye flour and water in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature overnight.

**4. The following day, remove the rye starter from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut the starter into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Mist with spray oil, cover the pieces with a towel or plastic wrap, and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**5. To make the final dough,** stir together the rye flour, salt, and seeds in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the soaker and the starter pieces. With a large metal spoon, stir in enough lukewarm water to bring everything together to form a ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment).

**6. Sprinkle rye flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Sprinkle the dough with more rye flour and gently knead the dough until all the pieces of starter are assimilated into the dough and the dough forms a very tacky ball (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). This will take 5 to 6 minutes by hand (4 minutes by machine). Add flour as needed (or small amounts of water if the dough is tight). Let the dough rest on the counter for 5 minutes, and then give it a few more turns to complete the kneading. It should register 77° to 81°F. (This dough will not make a good windowpane when stretched because of the low gluten content.) Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**7. Ferment for approximately 4 hours,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size.

**8. Sprinkle rye flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter, being careful to degas it as little as possible. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces, sprinkle them with rye flour, and gently shape them into _bâtards_. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and sprinkle the parchment with coarse rye flour, semolina flour, or cornmeal. Place the loaves on the pan at least 4 inches apart. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

**9. Either proof the dough** for 2 hours at room temperature or slip the entire pan into a food-grade plastic bag and immediately refrigerate overnight. If you are holding the dough overnight, remove the pan from the refrigerator 4 hours before baking and proof the dough at room temperature, or until about 1½ times its original size. It will have spread sideways as well as upward.

**10.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have a steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Remove the pan from the bag or lift off the plastic, and let the dough sit exposed for 5 minutes, then score it.

**11. If you are baking on a stone,** slide the parchment and dough onto the back of a sheet pan or onto a peel and then transfer it to the stone (or bake the bread directly in the sheet pan on which it was rising). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, mist the oven walls with water and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 425°F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until done. The internal temperature should register approximately 200°F and the crust should be hard and somewhat coarse (it will soften as the bread cools).

**12. Transfer the breads to a rack** and let them cool for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

The bread is best when made with a variety of grinds, from fine white rye to coarse pumpernickel or even rye chops (cracked rye kernels). This version uses a blend and also utilizes the soaker method to condition the grain and develop enzyme activity.

If you make rye bread regularly, you can keep a rye barm on hand in addition to your regular barm. Otherwise, you can use your regular barm starter and turn it into a rye starter, but it will contain a proportion of wheat. To make a pure rye-only starter, consult the Commentary.

Allow 3 days to make this bread (or start early on the second day to bake it around dinnertime). Because it is low in gluten, the bread will have a fairly tight crumb, not large and irregular as with standard hearth breads. The dough is slightly softer than French bread, but not as wet as ciabatta and other rustic doughs. This added hydration provides some physical leavening (steam) in support of the biological (wild-yeast) leavening provided by the starter. The result is a relatively dense loaf with a long shelf life.

This same formula also can be used for making spelt bread, another wheat relative that is lower in gluten (mainly it is lower in gliaden, which is the offensive half of gluten to those with sensitivities). Just substitute spelt for rye and follow the same directions.

As always with rye breads, the use of caraway, anise, or other seeds is optional. This bread is delicious with or without them.

## SOURDOUGH BREADS:

## _Poilâne-Style Miche_

BREAD PROFILE:

_Lean, standard dough; indirect method; wild yeast_

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 4 to 6 hours firm starter

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill starter; 15 minutes mixing; 6 to 7 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 55 to 65 minutes baking

The most famous bread baker in the world is probably Lionel Poilâne, whose _boulangerie_ in Paris's Latin Quarter makes only a few products. The most famous is a round, two-kilo, naturally fermented (wild-yeast) country bread that he calls a _miche_ but that everyone else calls _pain Poilâne._ His system is simple—each baker, Poilâne's personally trained apprentice, is responsible from start to finish for his loaves. This entails mixing and baking as well as stacking his own firewood and stoking his own fire. Poilâne teaches his apprentices to bake by feel as much as by formula, so there is no thermostat in the oven. The baker must determine when the oven is ready by holding his hand in the oven or tossing in a piece of paper to see how long it takes to turn to parchment and then burn. Poilâne critiques a loaf from each batch daily to keep abreast of the work of his men, since there are nearly twenty bakers in his stable, most working outside of Paris at his _manufacture_ in Bièvres.

The key to the Poilâne method is comprehending the craftsmanship of hand work, including understanding the fermentation process and commitment to the finest ingredients. Poilâne's flour is organically grown and is sifted to a partial whole wheat, a 90 to 95 percent extraction rate (this means that much, but not all, of the bran is still in the flour). The finished bread is somewhat dense and very chewy, its flavors changing in the mouth with each chew, and it keeps for about a week at room temperature.

Bread pilgrims come from all over the world to buy a Poilâne loaf (this includes those who visit Lionel's brother Max, who makes similar loaves at his own bakeries scattered around Paris). When I visited Boulangerie Poilâne on rue du Cherche-Midi, I noticed some very attractive gift boxes, complete with cutting board and knife. Apparently, many visitors buy these and have them shipped to family and friends. It speaks volumes that one man can become so iconic because of a commitment to his craft. Of course, it's fitting that in France this craft is bread baking.

The following version of the Poilâne-style _miche_ utilizes a long fermentation and a three-build system (the barm counts as the first build). It makes creative use of common kitchen bowls to replicate the difficult to find _banneton_ proofing baskets of Poilâne's operation. As always with baking, necessity is the mother of invention, and a home kitchen can always be modified to imitate, on a small scale, a commercial bakery.

Makes 1 large country _miche_ (large _boule),_ or 2 or 3 smaller _boules_

**FIRM STARTER**

1 cup (7 ounces) barm

2 cups (9 ounces) sifted medium-grind whole-wheat flour

About ½ cup (4 ounces) water, at room temperature

**FINAL DOUGH**

7 cups (32 ounces) sifted medium-grind whole-wheat flour

3¼ teaspoons (.81 ounce) salt (or 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt)

2 to 2¾ cups (18 to 22 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. The day before making the bread,** make the firm starter. In a 4-quart mixing bowl, use a large metal spoon to mix together the barm, flour, and enough water to form a firm ball. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for about 3 minutes, or until all the flour is hydrated and the ingredients are evenly distributed. Lightly oil a bowl, place the ball of dough in the bowl, and roll it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**2. Ferment at room temperature** for 4 to 6 hours, or until the dough doubles in size. Refrigerate overnight.

**3. Remove the starter from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut the starter into about 12 small pieces with a serrated knife or pastry scraper. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**4. This dough is too large for home mixers** (except for the Magic Mill), so knead it by hand. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sifted whole-wheat flour, salt, and starter pieces. Stirring with a large metal spoon, add at least 2¼ cups of the water, or enough to bring together all of the ingredients into a soft ball. Adjust the flour and water as you mix as needed.

**5. Sprinkle flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead the dough for 12 to 15 minutes, continuing to adjust the flour and water to form a supple, tacky but not sticky dough. All of the ingredients should be evenly distributed. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**6. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 4 hours,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size.

**7. Transfer the dough to the counter** and gently form it into a large _boule_. Proof the dough in a _banneton_ or prepare a proofing bowl large enough to hold the dough when it rises to nearly double in size. Place the dough, seam side up, in the _banneton_ or bowl and mist the exposed part of the dough with spray oil. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap.

**8. Proof at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours,** or until the dough grows 1½ times in size, or retard overnight in the refrigerator. If you are retarding the dough, remove the dough from the refrigerator 4 hours before you plan to bake it.

**9.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Carefully remove the top layer of cloth or plastic wrap from the dough 10 minutes before baking.

**10. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal. Gently turn out the dough onto the peel or pan, carefully removing the cloth liner off the dough, if using. Score the dough with a large pound sign, as shown below.

_Scoring_ pain Poilâne.

Slide the dough onto the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 2 cups hot water into the steam pan and close the door. Immediately lower the oven setting to 450°F. After 25 minutes, rotate the loaf 180 degrees and lower the oven setting to 425°F. Continue to bake for another 30 to 40 minutes, until the dough registers 200°F in the center. The bread should be deeply browned. If the bottom seems to be getting too dark before the loaf reaches the desired temperature, place an inverted sheet pan under the bread to protect the bottom. Likewise, if the top gets too dark, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the loaf to shield it from the heat.

**11. Transfer the bread to a rack** and let cool for at least 2 hours before slicing or serving. Store the bread in a brown paper bag. It should be good for 5 to 7 days.

_COMMENTARY_

You can sift medium-grain whole-wheat flour to approximate the high-extraction whole-wheat flour of the Poilâne _miche._ Choose a flour, preferably hard spring or winter wheat, or one with a bread flour gluten specification of 11.5 to 13 percent. Pass it through a sieve or sifter. It is better not to use regular or fine-grind whole-wheat flour, as most of the bran passes right through the sieve. With the medium-grind, the smaller particles of bran and germ will sift through, but the largest pieces will remain in the sieve. These bran particles can be used for multigrain breads or as add-ins to country breads made from white flour. Another option is to blend half whole-wheat flour and half bread flour wherever the instructions call for sifted whole-wheat flour.

Poilâne insists on using gray Normandy sea salt in his bread—he feels it makes a crucial difference. If you can get a hold of such salt, try it, but if not, proceed with any salt. Remember, the coarser the salt, the less it will weigh per teaspoon, so 1 teaspoon of table salt is equal to almost 2 teaspoons of coarse sea salt or kosher salt.

Many of the people who tested this formula commented that the full-size _miche_ was too heavy to handle easily. Feel free to divide this dough into 2 or even 3 smaller loaves—perhaps we should call them _petits pains Poilâne_ —and reduce the baking time but not the temperature.

According to M. Poilâne, this bread tastes best on the second or third day after it's baked. I prefer it about 3 hours after it comes out of the oven. Such is taste...

For twenty years I have been fascinated by, and have experimented with, rye breads in their many manifestations, but pumpernickel has always impressed me as the definitive rye (maybe it's just that it has the best name). There are countless versions of pumpernickel bread. Many Americans think the name simply refers to a dark rye, made dark by the addition of caramel coloring. What the name really refers to is a loaf made with coarsely ground whole-grain rye flour, the distinguishing characteristic of this particular type of rye bread. Some versions, though not the one that follows, are extremely dense, what I call cocktail rye, which needs to be sliced very thin. People who love this dense rye really do passionately love it, but it has a rather small following in the United States. In some eastern European villages, this bread was, and still is, made by adding the bread crumbs from previously baked loaves to the new dough. This gives the bread a wonderful texture. You can make the following formula with or without rye-bread crumbs, but it's a great way to use up dried-out leftover slices from the last loaf.

Makes two 1-pound loaves

**RYE STARTER**

1 cup (7 ounces) barm

1 cup (4.25 ounces) coarse whole-rye (pumpernickel-grind) flour

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature

**FINAL DOUGH**

2 cups (9 ounces) unbleached high-gluten, clear, or bread flour

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) brown sugar

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) cocoa powder, or carob powder, instant coffee, or 1 teaspoon liquid caramel coloring

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

1¼ teaspoons (.14 ounce) instant yeast

¾ to 1 cup (4 ounces) bread crumbs, dry or fresh, preferably from rye bread (optional)

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) vegetable oil

About ¼ cup (2 ounces) water, at room temperature

Semolina flour, cornmeal, or coarse whole rye flour for dusting

**1. The day before making the bread, make the starter.** Mix together the barm, rye flour, and water in a bowl. It will make a wet, pasty barm. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 4 to 5 hours, or until the sponge becomes bubbly and foamy. Immediately put it in the refrigerator overnight.

**2. Remove the rye barm from the refrigerator** about 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.

**3. To make the dough,** stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the rye barm, bread crumbs, and oil and stir until the ingredients form a ball (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment). Add water if the dough ball doesn't pick up all the flour or more bread flour if the dough seems too wet.

**4. Sprinkle high-gluten, clear, or bread flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead the dough for about 6 minutes (or mix on low speed with the dough hook for 4 to 5 minutes). Add flour as needed to make a smooth, pliable dough. It should be tacky but not sticky. (Note: Rye bread will become gummy if you mix it too long, so try to make all your adjustments early in the mixing process and minimize the mixing or kneading time.) The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**5. Ferment at room temperature for 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**6. Sprinkle a small amount of flour on the counter** and transfer the dough to the counter, taking care to degas it as little as possible. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape them into either _boules_ or _bâtards_ for freestanding loaves or sandwich loaves. Line a large sheet pan with baking parchment and sprinkle with cornmeal, semolina flour, or coarse whole-rye flour, or lightly oil two 8½ by 4½-inch bread pans. Transfer the dough to the pan(s), mist the dough with spray oil, and loosely cover with plastic wrap or a towel.

**7. Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes,** or until the dough crests 1 inch above the lip of the bread pans at the center, or rises to 1½ times its original size for freestanding loaves.

**8. If you are making freestanding loaves,** Prepare the oven for hearth baking, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Score the loaves. **If you are making loaf-pan breads,** preheat the oven to 350°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Place the loaf pans on a sheet pan.

**9. If you are baking freestanding loaves,** transfer the dough to the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the oven walls with water, and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 400F° and continue baking for another 15 to 30 minutes. Check the breads, rotating them 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. The finished loaves should register 200°F in the center and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. _If you are baking in loaf pans,_ transfer the sheet pan with the loaf pans to the oven. Bake for about 20 minutes, then rotate the sheet pan 180 degrees for even baking. Continue baking for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until the loaves register 185° to 195°F in the center and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

**10. Remove the finished loaves from the pans** and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

This version uses a mixed-method combination of wild-yeast starter and commercial yeast. The starter serves as both a pre-ferment and a soaker, improving the flavor enormously, while the commercial yeast gives a reliable final rise and diminishes the sour characteristics. If you prefer extra-sour bread, you can leave out the instant yeast and treat the dough as the sourdough bread, remembering to factor in the longer fermentation cycles.

The rye flour is turned into a rye barm in order to acidify the rye flour. This not only activates enzymes for flavor, but also makes the rye more digestible. Although not all rye breads are made this way, as a general rule, rye bread is always improved by using an acidic starter even when the final leavening push is provided by commercial yeast.

Cocoa is a traditional coloring agent for this bread, but you can also use one of the alternatives given, or simply leave it out altogether.

I love anything with sunflower seeds, and this bread is loaded with them. The seeds are nutritious, taste good, and are "loyal" (that is, they leave a long, nutty finish that fills the mouth so that you enjoy the bread long after you eat it). This is a variation of a formula developed by Craig Ponsford and the Coupe du Monde team in 1995. This new version utilizes a firm wild-yeast starter instead of _pâte fermentée._ The dough requires the starter, commercial yeast, and a soaker, so it entails a commitment, but the results are so memorable that it is well worth the effort.

1⅓ cups (5.65 ounces) coarse whole-rye (pumpernickel-grind) flour or rye meal

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DOUGH**

1 cup (5.5 ounces) firm starter

2 cups (9 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

1¼ teaspoons (.14 ounce) instant yeast

½ to ¾ cup (4 to 6 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

½ cup (2 ounces) toasted sunflower seeds

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. The day before making the bread, make the soaker** by stirring together the coarse rye flour and water in a small bowl. The rye will soak up the water quickly, but it will all hydrate. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it out overnight at room temperature.

**2. Also the day before baking (or up to 3 days before), make a firm starter.**

**3. The next day, remove the starter from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Sprinkle a little flour on the counter and transfer the starter to the counter. Cut it into 8 to 10 pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Mist with spray oil, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**4. To make the dough, stir together the flour, salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the soaker and starter pieces and then slowly add the water, stirring with a large metal spoon as you do (or mixing on low speed with the paddle attachment), until the ingredients form a soft ball.

**5. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and knead the dough (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Sprinkle on bread flour (not rye) as needed until the dough feels soft and supple, tacky but not sticky. Try to accomplish this within 4 minutes, by hand or machine, to avoid overmixing (rye flour gets gummy if mixed too long). Add the sunflower seeds by gradually working them into the dough within the next 2 minutes. Total mixing time should not exceed 6 minutes, if possible. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. If it is not up to 77°F it will take longer to ferment, but do not continue mixing. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it in the bowl to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**6. Ferment the dough at room temperature for 90 minutes,** or until it doubles in size.

**7. Sprinkle flour on the counter** and gently transfer the dough to the counter, taking care to minimize degassing of the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and gently form them into _boules_. Let them rest on the counter for 5 minutes, then shape them into a _couronne_. Transfer the dough to a sheet pan that has been lined with baking parchment and misted with spray oil, or use the _couche_ method. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a towel.

**8. Proof the dough at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until it increases to about 1½ times its original size.

**9.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F.

**10. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal and gently transfer the dough to the peel or pan. Slide the dough onto the baking stone (or bake directly on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the walls with water, and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals, then lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Check the breads, rotating them 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Lower the oven setting to 425°F and continue baking until the loaves are golden brown and register at least 200°F in the center. This should take 15 to 25 minutes longer.

**11. Remove the loaves from the oven** and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

_COMMENTARY_

You can substitute barm for the firm starter, but remember to cut back on the water in the final dough.

Stollen, heavily dusted with powdered sugar, with a panettone variation from the same dough in the background.

## Stollen

BREAD PROFILE:

_Rich, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast_

DAYS TO PREPARE: 1

_1 hour sponge; 20 minutes mixing; 2 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 50 to 70 minutes baking_

When you look at recipes for European holiday breads like panettone, stollen, _tsoureki,_ and _christopsomo,_ it seems as if they are all related, often sharing similar ingredients and proportions of fat and sugar. Often, the main difference is in the shaping and in the history and symbolism of each bread. But heaven help any of us if we propose that thought to someone who grew up with any of those breads. I once made stollen, panettone, and _kulich_ (Russian Easter bread) from a recipe for multipurpose holiday bread for a group of chefs and explained my theory of their similarities. Later, one of the American chefs told me I had offended some of the Germans who grew up on stollen and who were adamant that stollen is nothing like panettone. So I will resist the temptation to call this formula a multipurpose holiday bread (though I have made many types of bread from it) and instead limit it to its application as Dresden stollen.

Dresden is considered the spiritual home of this traditional Christmas bread. The bread symbolizes the blanket of the baby Jesus, and the colored fruits represent the gifts of the Magi. As in nearly every festival bread, the story aspect of this loaf is culturally important, for it is a way parents teach their children about their heritage. When such a story is accompanied by the flavor memory of a particular food, you have a tool much more powerful than didactic or pedagogical teaching. I'm convinced this must be the reason I offended those Germans that day when I implied that a stollen was like a panettone. Perhaps in taste and ingredients, yes, but never in association.

Makes 1 large or 2 small stollen

**SPONGE**

½ cup (4 ounces) whole milk

½ cup (2.25 ounces) all-purpose flour

4 teaspoons (.44 ounce) instant yeast

**FRUIT**

1 cup (6 ounces) golden raisins, plus additional for sprinkling on final dough

1 cup (6 ounces) candied fruit mix, plus additional for sprinkling on final dough

½ cup (4 ounces) brandy, rum, or schnapps

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) orange or lemon extract

**DOUGH**

2¼ cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) sugar

¾ teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) grated orange zest (optional)

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) grated lemon zest (optional)

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) ground cinnamon

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg

5 tablespoons (2.5 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature

About ¼ cup (2 ounces) water

½ cup (2 ounces) slivered blanched almonds (or marzipan, see Commentary)

Vegetable oil or melted butter for topping

Powdered sugar for topping

**1. Make the sponge by warming the milk to about 100°F.** Whisk in the flour and yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 1 hour, or until the sponge is very foamy and ready to collapse when tapped.

**2. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup each** of the raisins and fruit mix, the brandy, and the orange extract. Set aside.

**3. To make the dough, in a 4-quart mixing bowl** (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), stir together the flour, sugar, salt, orange and lemon zests, and cinnamon. Then stir in (or mix in on low speed with the paddle attachment) the sponge, egg, butter, and enough water to form a soft, but not sticky, ball. This should take about 2 minutes. When the dough comes together, cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.

**4. Add in the fruit and mix it with your hands (or on low speed) to incorporate.**

**5. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mixing with the dough hook) to distribute the fruit evenly, adding additional flour if needed. The dough should feel soft and satiny, tacky but not sticky. Knead for approximately 6 minutes (4 minutes by machine). Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**6. Ferment at room temperature for 45 minutes.** The dough will rise somewhat but will not double in size.

**7. Sprinkle flour lightly on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter.** If you are making 2 loaves, divide the dough in half. Proceed in one of the following ways. **Method 1:** Roll out the dough into a 9 by 6-inch rectangle (7 by 5-inch rectangle for 2 smaller loaver) and sprinkle the slivered almonds and additional fruit over the top. Roll the dough up into a _bâtard_ , sealing the crease by pinching the dough with the edge of your hand.

SHAPING STOLLEN, METHOD 2

This shaping method results in more of a "blanket-in-the-manger" look. With your hands, form the dough into a thick rectangle, 8 by 4 inches (5 by 3 inches for 2 smaller loaves), and dust it with flour. Sprinkle the top with slivered almonds and extra fruit.

Take a small rolling pin and press down on the center of the rectangle, then roll the dough in the center only, leaving 1 inch at both the top and the bottom edges as thick as the original rectangle. The new rectangle, with its thick top and bottom edges, should be 12 inches wide by 6 inches long (8 by 5 inches for 2 loaves). The interior of the rectangle should be about ½ inch thick.

Using a pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the counter, lift the top edge and bring it down and over the bottom edge, going just past the bottom edge. The thin inside part of the rectangle should remain behind the bottom edge.

Turn the dough seam side up and tuck additional slivered almonds and fruit under the dough flap.

Tuck more almonds and fruit under the new fold. The dough should have a folded, layered look, with fruit and almonds peeking out both sides. Gently squeeze the loaf to press it together.

Fold the top edge back over the bottom edge and rest it on the thin center section.

**8. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment.** Transfer the stollen to the pan and, as you set the dough down, curl it into a slight crescent. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Proof for approximately 1 hour at room temperature, or until the dough is 1½ times its original size.

**9. Preheat the oven to 350°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf.**

**10. Bake the stollen for 20 minutes.** Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue to bake for 20 to 50 minutes, depending on the size of the loaves. The bread will bake to a dark mahogany color, should register 190°F in the center of the loaf, and should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

**11. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack** and brush the top with vegetable oil while still hot. Immediately tap a layer of powdered sugar over the top through a sieve or sifter. Wait for 1 minute, then tap another layer over the first. The bread should be coated generously with the powdered sugar. Let cool for at least 1 hour before serving. When completely cool, store in a plastic bag. Or, leave them out uncovered overnight to dry out slightly, German style.

_COMMENTARY_

This version (and there are hundreds of authentic versions of stollen) is particularly good because it not only tastes great, but it also can be made in a reasonable amount of time, about 4 hours from start to finish. This is because of the strong sponge that leavens the rather heavy dough at a brisk pace. Of course, if you want to do it right, soak the fruit a few days ahead of time in brandy or schnapps. This improves the flavor and preserves the bread for weeks. Here's how: Two days before making this bread, soak the raisins and candied fruit in the brandy, rum, or schnapps and the orange or lemon extract, tossing the fruit a few times a day until the liquid is absorbed. If you'd prefer not to use alcohol, you can double the amount of extract and add ½ cup of water. You can also simply add the fruit, without the alcohol, into the final dough and add the extract directly to the dough.

A German friend, chef Heinz Lauer, told me he prefers to let his stollen dry out for a few days or even weeks before eating it. He cuts off thin, hard slices and dips them in wine or coffee, almost like biscotti. I tend to prefer it fresh from the oven.

Heinz also told me he prefers his stollen with a marzipan center. This is a common variation, and if you like this intensely flavored sweetened almond paste, as I do, you may replace the slivered almonds in the formula with a thick band of marzipan rolled into the center of the loaf.

You can substitute regular dried fruit, such as dried cranberries or apricots, for the candied fruit, if you prefer.

##  Swedish Rye (Limpa)

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 4 hours sponge

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill sponge; 6 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 35 to 50 minutes baking

What makes this version of rye different from the more popular German and deli ryes is the use of licorice-flavored aniseeds and fennel seeds, along with orange peel and a touch of cardamom. Nutritionists are now quantifying the therapeutic benefits of orange peel, licorice-flavored spices, and bitters as digestive aids that various traditional cultures have espoused for centuries. By making the bread with a combination of wild-yeast starter and commercial yeast, this formula creates an even more complexly flavored version of the bread than the more customary versions leavened only by commercial yeast. The lactic acid not only conditions the flour, predigesting it to an extent, but it also gives it a longer shelf life and better flavor. Think of this bread as a baked version of anisette.

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 1 large loaf

**SPONGE**

¾ cup (7 ounces) water plus 2 tablespoons

2½ tablespoons (1.75 ounces) molasses

1 tablespoon (.33 ounce) dried orange peel

or 1 teaspoon (.17 ounce) orange oil

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) ground aniseeds

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) ground fennel seeds

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) ground cardamom

1 cup (7 ounces) barm

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (5 ounces) white rye flour

**DOUGH**

2½ cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten, clear, or bread flour

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

4½ tablespoons (2.25 ounces) firmly packed brown sugar

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) shortening, melted and kept warm, or vegetable oil, warmed

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

1 egg white, whisked until frothy, for egg wash (optional)

**1. The day before making the bread, make the sponge.** Combine the water, molasses, orange peel, aniseeds, fennel seeds, and cardamom in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and then turn off the heat. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in the barm and rye flour until the flour is fully hydrated and evenly distributed. This should make a thick sponge. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 4 hours, or until the mixture becomes foamy. Refrigerate overnight.

**2. The next day, remove the sponge from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the bread dough to take off the chill.

**3. To make the dough,** in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), stir together the flour, yeast, salt, and brown sugar. Add the sponge and the melted shortening. Mix with a large metal spoon (or on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment) until the dough forms a ball. Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook) for approximately 4 minutes. Adjust with additional high-gluten (not rye) flour, if needed. The dough should be slightly tacky but not sticky. Do not overknead, as the rye flour will become gummy. The entire kneading or mixing process should be completed within 6 minutes. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for about 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead for 1 minute to degas.** Divide the dough in half for 1-pound loaves (or leave intact for a 2-pound loaf). Shape the dough into sandwich loaves or _bâtards_ for freestanding loaves. Lightly oil two 8½ by 4½-inch pans or one 9 by 5-inch pan; for freestanding loaves, line a large sheet pan with baking parchment and sprinkle with cornmeal or semolina flour. Transfer the loaves to the pan(s) and score the top of the loaves with 3 parallel slashes. Mist the loaves with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag.

**6. Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes,** or until the dough crests 1 inch above the bread pans at the center, or rises 1½ times its original size for freestanding loaves.

**7. Preheat the oven to 350°F.** For freestanding loaves, brush the egg wash over the surface of the dough just prior to baking. This is optional for loaf-pan breads.

**8. Bake for 20 minutes, then rotate the pan(s) 180 degrees for even baking.** Continue to bake for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the loaves. They should register 190°F in the center, be a light golden brown, and make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom. If the sides are still white or soft, return the bread to the oven to finish.

**9. When the loaves are finished baking,** immediately remove them from the pans and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

By being scored before the final proofing the breads take on a different look than when scored just prior to baking, as is customary for most breads. The cuts fill in during the rising period and spread out. When the bread bakes, it seems as if the cuts have healed, leaving behind a different shade of crust where the cuts were made.

## Tuscan Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 15 minutes flour paste

_Day 2:_ 10 to 12 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 50 minutes baking

What makes Tuscan bread unique in the bread lexicon is that it is salt free, which makes it wonderful for people on salt-restricted diets. Unfortunately, the lack of salt also makes it rather dull and flat tasting. Tuscans, no slouches when it comes to full-flavored food, remedy this by lavishing it with intensely flavored spreads and pastes, or eating it with flavorful dishes, such as garlic- and olive oil–infused white bean soup. A technique that is also unique to this bread is the use of a cooked flour paste, made the day before. This is different from a pre-ferment since there is no yeast added and the paste does not ferment, but the gelatinized starches release flavors that gives this bread a distinct quality, quite unlike any other bread. This is one of those underused techniques that offer great opportunity for exploration. Once you've mastered it in this bread, try applying it to some other doughs, like Vienna or Italian. It is yet another way to control flavor by manipulating time, temperature, and ingredients.

Makes two 1-pound loaves

**FLOUR PASTE**

1¾ cups (14 ounces) boiling water

2 cups (9 ounces) unbleached bread flour

**DOUGH**

2⅔ cups (12 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2½ teaspoons (.28 ounce) instant yeast

2 tablespoons (1 ounce) olive oil

About ½ cup (4 ounces) water, at room temperature

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Make the paste 1 or 2 days before making the bread.** Pour the boiling water over the flour in a mixing bowl and stir vigorously until the flour is hydrated and makes a thick, smooth paste. Cool, cover, and leave out overnight at room temperature.

**2. The next day, make the dough.** With a large metal spoon, mix together the flour and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the paste and olive oil. Stir together (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment), adding as much water as it takes to make a soft, supple ball. It's okay if the dough is a little sticky because you can add more flour while kneading.

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and knead by hand for about 10 minutes (or mix for 6 to 8 minutes on medium speed with the dough hook; you can let the dough rest after 4 minutes of mixing and resume 5 minutes later to make it easier on your machine). The dough should be tacky but not sticky. Continue to sprinkle in more flour as needed. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours.** If the dough doubles in size prior to that, knead it lightly to degas it (the "punch down") and return it to the bowl to continue fermenting until it doubles again or until a total of 2 hours has elapsed.

**5. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and lightly sprinkle with cornmeal** or semolina flour. Gently divide the dough into 2 equal pieces (they should weigh about 18 ounces each), being careful to minimize degassing the dough. With a light touch to protect the internal gas, form the dough into _boules_. If you plan to bake the loaves as rounds, transfer the dough to the prepared sheet pan. If you prefer oblong loaves, shape the dough rounds into _bâtards_ after a 15-minute resting period, and then place them on the prepared pan. Mist the dough lightly with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

**6. Proof the dough at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until it nearly doubles in size. (You can also retard the dough by placing the covered pan in the refrigerator immediately after shaping and leave overnight. The dough should be nearly ready to bake when you pull it out of the refrigerator. If not, leave out at room temperature for a couple of hours.)

**7.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have a steam pan in place. Pour 2 cups of water into the steam pan. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Just prior to baking, mist the loaves with water and dust lightly with bread flour by tapping some through a sieve held over the loaves or by flinging the flour across the surface of the dough. Score the breads.

**8. Slide the breads directly on to the baking stone,** parchment and all, or place the pan on the middle shelf of the oven. After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the oven walls with water, and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals, and then lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the steam pan 10 minutes after loading the oven (be careful not to splash yourself in case there's any water left), rotate the loaves 180 degrees for even baking, and continue baking for 10 to 20 minutes longer, or until the loaves turn a rich golden color and register over 200°F in the center. If the crust is getting too dark and the inside has not reached above 200°F, place an aluminum foil tent over the loaves and continue baking until the desired temperature is reached.

**9. Transfer the loaves to a rack and cool for at least 1 hour** before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

A variation of this bread can be made with a _biga_ instead of the flour paste, and comes out nicely as a salt-free Italian or French bread. I wouldn't call it true Tuscan bread, though, because it doesn't have that unique flavor brought about by the cooked flour.

Unlike most hearth breads where we pour 1 cup of water into a steam pan, this bread calls for a pan with 2 cups of water to be preheated along with the oven. This extra water ensures a moist oven that yields a better shine on the crust.

_Vienna Bread is the perfect loaf for a Dutch-Crunch topping_

## Vienna Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 1¼ hours _pâte fermentée_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _pâte fermentée;_ 10 to 12 minutes mixing; 3½ to 4 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 20 to 35 minutes baking

With all the emphasis on French and Italian rustic breads these days, it is easy to overlook the fact that the real center of the bread and pastry universe for hundreds of years was Vienna. Most of the great French breads that we love today, including baguettes, croissants, and even puff pastry, came to France a couple hundred years ago via the Austro-Hungarian empire, where they found a hungry audience willing to support these Austrian (which included Polish) bakers. Nowadays, the main distinction in American (and even European) bakeries between French, Italian, and Vienna breads, is the presence of a few enrichments in the latter. A little added sugar and malt causes the crust to brown faster, and a small amount of butter or shortening tenderizes the dough by coating and "shortening" the gluten strands. The shape, as with all culturally based bread, is determined by the baker based on function, but we usually think of Vienna bread as typically twelve inches long and weighing one pound. It is often scored down the middle to make a nice "ear," but does not have quite as hard a crust nor as open a crumb as French bread. This dough makes exceptional _pistolets_ (torpedo rolls), similar to the hoagie rolls made from the Italian bread, and it can be baked in loaf pans for excellent sandwich loaves. One of the best applications for this dough is to make Dutch crunch bread.

Makes two 1-pound loaves or 9 to 12 _pistolets_

2⅓ cups (13 ounces) _pâte fermentée_

2⅔ cups (12 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) granulated sugar

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) diastatic barley malt powder

or 1 tablespoon (.75 ounce) barley malt syrup

1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) unsalted butter or shortening, at room temperature or melted

¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons

(6 to 7 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Remove the _pâte fermentée_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill.

**2. Stir together the flour, sugar, malt powder (if using), salt, and yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the _pâte fermentée_ pieces, egg, butter, malt syrup (if using), and ¾ cup of the water. Stir together with a large metal spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. If not all the flour is absorbed, add the remaining 2 tablespoons water, or as much as is necessary to make the dough soft and supple, not firm and stiff.

**3. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter.** Knead for about 10 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 6 minutes), adding flour if needed to make a firm but supple dough, slightly tacky but not sticky. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for 2 hours.** If the dough doubles in size before then, remove it from the bowl and knead for a few seconds to degas it (the "punch down") and then return it to the bowl to continue fermenting until 2 hours have elapsed or until the dough doubles in size again.

**5. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 equal pieces for loaves,** or into 9 to 12 smaller pieces (3 to 4 ounces each) for _pistolets._ Shape larger pieces into _boules_ or smaller pieces into rolls. Mist the dough lightly with spray oil, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.

**6. Shape the larger pieces into _bâtards_ or the smaller pieces into _pistolets_.** Line a sheet pan with baking parchment, dust with semolina flour or cornmeal, and transfer the dough to the pan. Mist the dough lightly with spray oil and cover the pan loosely with plastic.

**7. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes,** or until the loaves or rolls have risen to approximately 1¾ times their original size.

**8.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Just prior to baking, mist the loaves or rolls with water and dust lightly with bread flour by tapping some through a sieve or by flinging the flour across the surface of the dough. Score the loaves or rolls down the center, or leave the rolls uncut.

**9. Slide the loaves directly onto the baking stone,** parchment and all, or place the sheet pan with the loaves or rolls in the oven. Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the oven door. After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the oven walls with water, and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 400°F and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the breads 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking until they are a medium golden brown and register at least 200°F at the center. This should take anywhere from 5 additional minutes for rolls to 20 minutes for loaves.

**10. Remove the loaves or rolls from the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack.** Cool for at least 45 minutes before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

This version of Vienna dough is improved by the pre-ferment method that I've been touting throughout this book. You will rarely find another version made in quite this same way, as most Vienna bread formulas are made by the direct-dough method. But the use of more than 100 percent pre-ferment adds so much character to the bread that I'll never turn back. Vienna rolls made from this dough are a huge hit at Johnson & Wales, where students eagerly line up for sandwiches whenever we send these rolls to the dining hall.

GRACE NOTE   Dutch Crunch or Mottled Bread

Dutch crunch is one of many names given to bread made with a special mottled topping. It doesn't refer to any particular formula, as the crunch topping can be spread on pretty much any type of bread. But if you grew up with a certain brand of Dutch crunch, you may associate it with particular styles of bread, like a chewy white bread or a light wheat loaf. Dutch bakers were among the many northern European bread makers who popularized this style of garnishing loaves, and the method caught on quickly in certain regions of America when it was first introduced. I find that Austrian-style bread, with its slightly enriched but chewy texture, is particularly suited to this treatment, which is a slurry paste made with rice flour, sugar, yeast, oil, salt, and water. However, feel free to use it on any type of sandwich dough or enriched breads (but not on lean French bread dough, with its hard crust).

The paste is brushed on the dough either right before the final proofing stage, or just before the bread goes into the oven. (If you brush it on before proofing, the separation and mottling is greater and more dramatic; brushing it on just before baking results in a more even coating.) The paste is fermented by the yeast, and it grows while the dough grows. But because the rice flour has very little gluten to hold it together, it spreads apart and then gelatinizes and caramelizes when the bread is baked. This leaves a mottled, slightly sweet, crunchy coating on the bread that kids find especially mesmerizing. You can use the topping on loaf-pan bread as well as on freestanding loaves.

Rice flour is available at most natural foods markets. You can use either white or brown rice flour or even Cream of Rice cereal. Alternatives would be fine cornmeal, cornstarch, potato starch, semolina flour, or cake flour (it's low in gluten), but they each deliver a different flavor and texture. Rice flour or Cream of Rice cereal is the most commonly used because it is, well, perfect for the job.

To make the topping, whisk together, 1 tablespoon bread flour, ¾ cup rice flour, ¾ teaspoon instant yeast, 2 teaspoons granulated sugar, ¼ teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, and 6 to 8 tablespoons of water to make a paste. If it seems too thin to spread without running off the top of the dough, add more rice flour. It should be thick enough to spread with a brush, but not so thick that it sits like a lump of mud. This makes enough for 2 to 4 loaves.

## White Breads: Three Multipurpose Variations

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; direct or indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 1

1 hour sponge (Variation 3 only); 8 to 10 minutes mixing; 3½ to 4 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 45 minutes baking

White bread is known under many names, including pullman, milk dough, _pain de mie_ (bread of the crumb), and just plain old white bread. It has many uses, including dinner and knotted rolls, sandwich bread, burger buns, and hot dog buns. This style of dough is often referred to as milk dough because in most versions the hydration is primarily from fresh milk (or powdered milk and water). These white breads fall into the category of enriched breads, as they are made with the most often used natural dough conditioners: fat (butter or oil), sugar, and milk. These cause the crust to caramelize quickly and, when fermented correctly, give the finished bread a light-as-air quality with a very soft texture. The internal temperature need only reach just above 180°F for rolls and 185° to 190°F for loaves. Because of the enrichments, it is best to bake full-sized loaves at 350°F and small rolls at 400°F, but never at 450°F, as you would with lean hearth breads.

The three variations that follow give you some flexibility regarding ingredients. You may substitute powdered milk (DMS) for the liquid milk and vice versa, and you may also substitute in equal measure low-fat milk, buttermilk, or skim milk for the whole milk. Making these substitutions will affect the final outcome slightly in both flavor and texture, so try making the breads with the variations and see which version you prefer (I tend to be a buttermilk guy). You can also freely substitute margarine or shortening or even liquid oil for the butter. Again, the type of fat you use will affect flavor and texture, but they all tenderize the bread. Shortening gives the softest texture, butter the best flavor.

COMMENTARY

This is one type of bread that does not greatly improve from a pre-ferment or sponge because so much of the flavor comes from external, rather than internal, factors. Though it can be made by the sponge method, as Variation 3 demonstrates, the fast action and the amount of yeast and enrichments ensure that this is a fast-moving dough whose flavor is largely a result of the enrichments, not the fermentation. For this reason, it is one of the easiest breads to make, whether made by the direct method or the indirect method. It is quite delicious and functional in its many applications regardless of the method followed. Variation 1, however, makes particularly good soft dinner rolls or hot dog or hamburger buns.

###  Variation 1

Makes two 1-pound loaves, 18 dinner rolls, or 12 burger or hot dog buns

4¾ cups (21.5 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

¼ cup (1.33 ounces) powdered milk (DMS)

3¼ tablespoons (1.66 ounces) sugar

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten, at room temperature

3¼ tablespoons (1.66 ounces) butter, margarine, or shortening, melted or at room temperature

1½ cups plus 1 table-spoon to 1¾ cups (13 to 14 ounces) water, at room temperature

1 egg, whisked with 1 teaspoon water until frothy, for egg wash (optional)

Sesame or poppy seeds for garnish (optional)

**1. Mix together the flour, salt, powdered milk, sugar, and yeast** in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Pour in the egg, butter, and 1½ cups plus 1 tablespoon water and mix with a large metal spoon (or on low speed of the electric mixer with the paddle attachment) until all the flour is absorbed and the dough forms a ball. If the dough seems very stiff and dry, trickle in more water until the dough is soft and supple.

**2. Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter,** and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook), adding more flour, if necessary, to create a dough that is soft, supple, and tacky but not sticky. Continue kneading (or mixing) for 6 to 8 minutes. (In the electric mixer, the dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick ever so slightly to the bottom.) The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 80°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**3. Ferment at room temperature for 1½ to 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size (the length of time will depend on the room temperature).

**4. Remove the fermented dough from the bowl** and divide it in half for sandwich loaves, into eighteen 2-ounce pieces for dinner rolls, or twelve 3-ounce pieces for burger or hot dog buns. Shape the pieces into _boules_ for loaves or tight rounds for dinner rolls or buns. Mist the dough lightly with spray oil and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest for about 20 minutes.

**5. For loaves,shape as for sandwich loaves.** Lightly oil two 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans and place the loaves in the pans. For rolls and buns, line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment. Rolls require no further shaping. For hamburger buns, gently press down on the rolls to form the desired shape. For hot dog buns, shape as for torpedo rolls, though without tapering the ends. Transfer the rolls or buns to the sheet pans.

**6. Mist the tops of the dough with spray oil** and loosely cover with plastic wrap or a towel. Proof the dough at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, or until it nearly doubles in size.

**7. Preheat the oven to 350°F for loaves or 400°F for roll and buns.** Brush the rolls or buns with the egg wash and garnish with poppy or sesame seeds. Sandwich loaves also may be washed and garnished, or score them down the center and rub a little vegetable oil into the slit.

**8. Bake the rolls or buns for approximately 15 minutes,** or until they are golden brown and register just above 180°F in the center. Bake loaves for 35 to 45 minutes, rotating 180 degrees halfway through for even baking, if needed. The tops should be golden brown and the sides, when removed from the pan, should also be golden. The internal temperature of the loaves should be close to 190°F, and the loaves should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

**9. When the loaves have finished baking,** remove them immediately from the pans and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving. Rolls should cool for at least 15 minutes on a rack before serving.

## Whole-Wheat Bread

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast

DAYS TO MAKE: 2

_Day 1:_ 2 to 4 hours soaker and _poolish_

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill _poolish;_ 15 minutes mixing; 3½ hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 45 to 60 minutes baking

There are some terrific baking books that focus on 100 percent whole-grain bread, and this style of bread has a fanatically loyal, and growing, following. I began my bread journey thirty years ago as a devotee of organic whole-grain bread, mainly for philosophical and health reasons. Though I've branched out to explore the entire bread kingdom and its infinite permutations, I still have a soft spot for what we used to call "pure bread."

The challenge a baker faces in making such breads is extracting the best of the grain flavor while overcoming some of the grassy and bitter tones of the bran and germ. Another challenge is attaining a crumb network that opens up both flavor and texture.

The best way to evoke flavor, as we show in many of the formulas, is to give the enzymes enough time to break out sugars trapped in the starches. One way to do this when working with whole grains is to use a large amount of pre-ferment, such as a _poolish_ or soaker. In this version, we will use both methods. A soaker is especially effective when coarse grains are part of the formula, and it also leaves open the option of substituting other grains, such as corn or oats, in place of the wheat to vary the texture of the finished loaf. Using a _poolish_ to extend fermentation time contributes more flavor by developing acidity, balancing out the grassy flavor of the bran and germ in the process.

Makes two 1-pound loaves

**SOAKER**

1 cup (4.25 ounces) coarse whole-wheat flour or other coarsely ground whole grains (oats, corn, barley, rye)

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature

**WHOLE-WHEAT POOLISH**

1½ cups (6.75 ounces) high-protein whole-wheat flour

¼ teaspoon (.028 ounce) instant yeast

¾ cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature

**DOUGH**

2 cups (9 ounces) high-protein whole-wheat flour

1 ⅓ teaspoons (.33 ounce) salt

1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast

2 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) honey

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) vegetable oil (optional)

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten (optional)

2 tablespoons sesame seeds, poppy seeds, quick oats, or wheat bran for garnish (optional)

**1. The day before making the bread, make the soaker and the _poolish._** For the soaker, mix together the coarse whole-wheat flour and the water in a bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it at room temperature until the next day. For the _poolish,_ mix together the whole-wheat flour and yeast, then stir in the water to make a thick paste. Stir only until all the flour is hydrated, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, or until it just begins to bubble. Then put it in the refrigerator overnight.

**2. The next day remove the _poolish_ from the refrigerator** 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill. In a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), stir together the whole-wheat flour, salt, and yeast. Then add the _poolish_ and the soaker, as well as the honey, oil, and egg. Stir with a large metal spoon (or mix on low speed for about 1 minute with the paddle attachment) until the dough forms a ball, adding more water or flour if needed.

**3. Sprinkle whole-wheat flour on the counter,** transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Add flour if necessary and knead until the dough forms a firm, supple dough. This will take 10 to 15 minutes by hand, slightly less by machine. The dough should be tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**4. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours,** or until the dough doubles in size.

**5. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces** (they should weigh about 18 ounces each). Shape them into sandwich loaves. Lightly oil two 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans and place the loaves in the pans. Mist the tops with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap.

**6. Proof at room temperature for about 90 minutes,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size and is cresting above the lip of the pans.

**7. Preheat the oven to 350°F** with the oven rack in the middle of the oven. Just before baking, you may choose to garnish the loaves by misting the tops with water and sprinkling on sesame seeds.

**8. Bake the loaves for about 30 minutes,** then rotate them 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes longer. The finished bread should register between 185° and 190°F at the center and should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. The loaves should be golden brown all around and firm on the sides as well as on the top and bottom. If they are soft and squishy on the sides, return them to the pans and continue baking until done.

**9. When the loaves have finished baking,** remove them immediately from the pans and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

Coarse flour weighs slightly less per cup than regular grind flour because it doesn't pack as tightly and contains more air. This explains why the coarse flour is only 4.25 ounces, while the regular whole-wheat flour used in the rest of the formula weighs 4.5 ounces per cup.

The bread will develop a more open crumb if the flour is high in protein. The strongest flour comes from hard spring wheat, which can often be found at natural food markets that offer a variety of flours (see also Resources). You may also substitute regular whole-wheat flour from the supermarket.

The use of oil and/or egg is offered as an option to tenderize the bread. If you use either of them, you will need to add additional flour during the final mixing. Let the dough determine how much flour to add, as you knead it to a firm, slightly tacky consistency. Another way to tenderize the dough is to use milk or buttermilk instead of water when making the _poolish._

# THE FINAL GRACE NOTE:  
Wood-Fired Baking in Bennett Valley

Maggie Glezer's wonderful book, _Artisan Baking Across America,_ profiles some of the finest bakeries in the United States, along with many of their distinctive breads. Maggie is someone with whom I love talking bread. Unfortunately, she wrote her book before Bennett Valley Bread and Pastry opened in the spring of 2000, and was thus unable to feature them. This artisan bakery is the creative outlet of Tim and Crystal Decker. Crystal makes the award-winning pastries and Tim, who used to be my head baker at Brother Juniper's Bakery in Santa Rosa, creates and bakes all the breads. Tim's breads won fifteen double-gold medals at the prestigious Sonoma County Harvest Fair, including the sweepstakes award for best in show—and that just a few months after the shop opened! The last person to do as well was Craig Ponsford of Artisan Bakers, who then went on to win the world championship of bread at the 1995 Coupe du Monde de la Boulangerie.

_Tim, his long-handled peel, and his oven._

Tim is a true bread fanatic and purist, nurturing his doughs from start to finish with almost the same degree of love as if they were his children (and his real kids sometimes help at the bakery, knowing how important the loaves are to their dad). He plays his wood-fired oven the way he plays his electric guitar (he was in a heavy metal and blues band when we first met)—that is, with intensity, pushing it to its limits. In the middle of each night, he builds a wood fire from local oak on the deck of the oven and waits for it to burn down to ashes, which he then sweeps out. At that point the oven is up to about 650°F and is ready to receive the first of many doughs. The oven will bake each round of strategically chosen bread as it gradually cools over the next eight to twelve hours; the pizzas, focaccia, and hard crusty breads going first while the softer, more enriched doughs are saved for the later, cooler cycles. Tim currently holds the national record for consecutive bakes from a single firing: sixteen. I asked him who keeps track of such arcane statistics, and he assured me that there is a network of fire and oven freaks out there who take these things seriously. Tim is able to sustain the heat from a single firing because of a unique insulation system he devised to supplement the original system that oven master Alan Scott, founder of Oven Crafters, designed. This makes it possible for Tim to bake all day (and night) without having to build a new fire on the deck. Other wood-fired oven bakers are now coming to see Tim, even though he's the new guy on the block, for tips on how to insulate their ovens for better heat retention.

_Hearth baking begins by firing the oven with hardwood, in this instance oak._

_A wood-fired deck radiates enough heat to bake bread as long as eight hours after the initial firing._

Tim's and Crystal's story is significant because it is a good example of the kind of passion fueling the bread revolution. Bread baking is a difficult career and one that does not lead to riches, except in rare cases. You do it because it brings about other kinds of satisfaction and rewards and because it makes people happy.

I had the good fortune of watching Tim grow both as a baker and in his love for the well-crafted loaf. He first learned the craft while making bread at Lotus Bakery, an organic, whole-grain bakery in Santa Rosa owned by Lynn and Jim Dow, also friends of mine. (It is important to convey that the bread bakers of Sonoma County have achieved that collegial fellowship born of friendly competitiveness. Everyone knows each other and helps out when someone is short of ingredients or needs equipment help, and there is a free flow of shared ideas and respect for one another's style and products. As a result, many of the local bakers are friends as well as competitors, and this friendship is also fostered on a wider scale by the Bread Bakers Guild of America, of which many of the local bakers are members.)

Tim came to Brother Juniper's for the next stage in his bread-baking evolution and spent seven years perfecting my breads, all the while nurturing his own budding vision. After I sold Brother Juniper's, he went to work at another award-winning shop, the Village Bakery in Sebastopol, just outside of Santa Rosa. Here, Tim was able to focus more on wild-yeast breads and dive fully into starters and pre-ferments, while also adding to his skills by participating in training seminars and networking with other bakers. Crystal also worked for the Village Bakery as the pastry chef, so they were finally able to work together in the same bakeshop. It was there they realized that their true dream was to have a bakery of their own, one in which they could have total control of the systems and formulas to produce breads and pastries the way they wanted them to be, according to their own vision.

So, having served their long apprenticeship and fully knowing what they were getting into, they resurrected a defunct bakeshop in a Santa Rosa neighborhood called Bennett Valley, built a wood-fired oven to supplement the existing, creaky, revolving-reel oven, and plunged into business. The bakery was discovered almost immediately by the savvy foodies of Sonoma County. Now, because they can't keep up with the demand for their products, they face the same problem that Lionel Poilâne faced (and solved) in Paris: how to grow their business but stay true to their artisan vision. It's an age-old quandary: how to make an honest living without compromising the quality of your work. Knowing Tim and Crystal and the integrity that they embody, and their love of the work they do together, I expect they will come up with some very creative solutions. As we went to press with this book, Tim was discussing the possibility of building a second wood-fired oven at his original training ground, Lotus Bakery, where Jim and Lynn Dow are willing to help the Deckers expand their baking capacity to meet the growing demand.

This is a classic feel-good story. It makes me proud to see one of my apprentice protégés go beyond where I could go when I was an active baker, taking the handoff, so to speak, not just from me but from a lineage of others who were also giving and taking handoffs. Tim and Crystal Decker personify the craftsperson tradition at its finest, a transmission of knowledge from hand to hand, knowledge building upon knowledge. Their story exemplifies what I am trying to accomplish with this book, this transmission. I hope that you, each and every reader, will take the handoff of this vision and run with it. Take all that has gone before and find your own baking voice, and build your bread your way.

As a fitting epilogue and a parting gift, here are two of Bennett Valley Bread and Pastry's most popular breads, created and handed off to you, the next generation, by Tim Decker.

##  Potato, Cheddar, and Chive Torpedoes

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; mixed leavening method

DAYS TO MAKE: 1(WITH BARM)

1 hour to prepare potatoes and de-chill barm; 45 minutes mixing; 3 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 35 to 4o minutes baking.

Makes two 1½-pound loaves

1 large or 2 small (8 ounces) unpeeled potatoes, coarsely chopped, boiled in 3 cups water until soft, and cooled

½ to 1 cup (4 to 8 ounces) potato water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F) (saved from above)

1½ cups (10.5 ounces) barm

4 cups (18 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

2 teaspoons (.5 ounce) salt

¼ cup (1 ounce) chopped fresh chives

6 thin slices (about 4 ounces) sharp Cheddar cheese

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. Prepare the potatoes in advance,** allowing time for the potatoes and the cooking water to cool to lukewarm. Set these aside until needed. Pull the measured amount of barm out of the refrigerator 1 hour before making the bread to take off the chill.

**2. With a large metal spoon, stir together the barm,** half of the flour, the yeast, cooked potatoes, and ½ cup of the potato water in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer using the paddle attachment). Let this sit uncovered for 30 minutes.

**3. Add the rest of the flour and the salt** and mix together until the ingredients form a ball, adding as much as you need of the remaining water.

**4. Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter,** and knead the dough for about 6 minutes (or mix on medium-low speed with the dough hook). Add flour or water if needed. Add the chives and continue kneading (or mixing) until they are evenly distributed, about 2 minutes. (In the mixer, the dough should clear the sides of the bowl as well as the bottom of the bowl.) The dough should pass the windowpane test, be very tacky but not sticky, and register 77° to 81°F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**5. Ferment at room temperature for about 90 minutes,** or until the dough doubles in size.

###  Variation 2

Makes two 1-pound loaves, 18 dinner rolls, or 12 burger or hot dog buns

4¼ cups (19 ounces) unbleached bread flour

1½ teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt

3 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) sugar

2 teaspoons (.22 ounce) instant yeast

1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten, at room temperature

¼ cup (2 ounces) butter, margarine, or shortening, at room temperature, or vegetable oil

1½ cups (12 ounces) buttermilk or whole milk, at room temperature

**Proceed as directed forVariation 1,** substituting the buttermilk for the water. Add more buttermilk or flour, as needed, while mixing.

**6. Transfer the dough to the counter and cut it into 2 equal pieces.** Press each piece into the shape of a rectangle approximately 6 inches wide by 8 inches long. Lay 3 slices of cheese on each rectangle, covering the surface but leaving a ½-inch border uncovered around the edges. Tightly roll up the dough, from bottom to top, jelly-roll style, creating a spiral with the cheese. Seal the ends of the rolled dough, which should look like a log, into points by rolling them more forcefully with your hands. This will give the dough a torpedo look, plump in the center and tapered at the ends. As you roll down on the ends, be sure to squeeze out all trapped air pockets to avoid separation of the layers. Seal the bottom seam closed with the edge of your hand.

**7. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment,** mist the parchment lightly with spray oil, then dust the parchment with cornmeal or semolina flour. Lay the 2 loaves across the width of the pan, mist the tops lightly with spray oil, and cover them loosely with plastic wrap or a towel.

**8. Proof at room temperature for approximately 1 hour,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size.

**9.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Score the top of each loaf with 2 diagonal slashes, making sure to cut through to the first layer of cheese.

**10. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the loaves, with or without parchment, to the peel or pan. Slide the loaves onto the baking stone or bake the loaves directly on the pan. Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and shut the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door again. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. After 15 minutes, rotate the loaves 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. The loaves should register 200°F in the center, be nicely browned all over, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. The cheese will bubble out of the cuts, crisp up, and also brown.

**11. Transfer the finished loaves to a rack and cool** for at least 45 minutes before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

These are mixed-method (wild yeast spiked with commercial yeast) _bâtards._ They pucker open with a _grigne_ of crispy Cheddar cheese, followed by a beautiful soft cheese spiral highlighted with bits of green chives. Notice that the bread is made with a wet-sponge starter (the barm), but it can also be made with a firm starter, in which case you will need about ½ cup more water or potato water. The potato water, by the way, adds minerals and dissolved potato starch and sugars that greatly enhance the flavor and soften the dough.

_Roasted Onion and Asiago Miche_

## Roasted Onion and Asiago Miche

BREAD PROFILE:

Enriched, semi-rustic dough; indirect method; mixed leavening method

DAYS TO MAKE: 3

_Day 1:_ 8 hours sponge

_Day 2:_ 1 hour to de-chill sponge and prpare onions; 15 minutes mixing; 2 to 3 hours fermentation and shaping

_Day 3:_ 2½ hours proofing and final shaping; 35 to 50 minutes baking

Makes 2 large rounds

**SPONGE**

¼ cup (2 ounces) barm

1 cup (8 ounces) water, at room temperature

2½ cups (11.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour

**ROASTED ONION**

1 large or 2 small (8 ounces) onions

1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) olive oil

Pinch of coarsely ground black pepper

¼ teaspoon (.06 ounce) salt

**DOUGH**

7 cups (32 ounces) unbleached bread flour

2¼ teaspoons (.25 ounce) instant yeast

2¼ cups (18 ounces) water, lukewarm (90° to 100°F)

4 teaspoons (1 ounce) salt

3 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) olive oil

3 cups (16 ounces) shredded or grated Asiago cheese (or substitute Parmesan, Romano, or dry Jack, but use fresh, not boxed cheese)

½ cup (2 ounces) coarsely chopped chives

½ cup (2 ounces) coarsely chopped scallions

Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting

**1. One day before making the dough** and 2 days before baking the bread, make the sponge. Mix together the barm, water, and flour in a bowl until the flour is completely hydrated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 8 hours, or until the sponge is very bubbly. If it is a cool day and the sponge is fermenting slowly, you can leave it out overnight. Otherwise, put it in the refrigerator when it foams and is bubbly.

**2. Remove the sponge from the refrigerator** about 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill.

**3. To roast the onion, preheat the oven to 500°F** and line a sheet pan with baking parchment. Coarsely chop the onion and toss the pieces in a bowl with the olive oil. Spread the onions on the sheet pan. Sprinkle the pepper and salt over the onions. Bake, stirring every 3 to 5 minutes, or until the pieces turn golden brown or even begin to char slightly. This will take 15 to 20 minutes (or sauté them in a hot skillet; it will take about the same amount of time). Remove the onion from the pan and set aside to cool, then refrigerate until needed.

**4. To make the dough, stir together the flour and yeast** in a large mixing bowl with a large metal spoon. Add the water and the sponge and stir until all the ingredients are evenly distributed and the dough forms a ball. Let sit for 5 minutes, then add the salt and olive oil and stir to distribute. Add half of the grated cheese and all of the chives and scallions.

**5. Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter.** Knead the dough for about 4 minutes, or until all the ingredients are evenly distributed, adding additional flour as needed to make a soft, tacky, but not sticky dough. The dough should pass the windowpane test, register about 74°F, and be very supple. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

**6. Ferment at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours,** or until the dough nearly doubles in size.

**7. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment,** mist with spray oil, and dust with semolina flour or cornmeal. Dust the counter with flour and transfer the dough from the bowl to the counter, taking care not to degas the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and gently shape them into large _boules_. Place a round of dough on each pan. Mist the dough with spray oil and slip each pan into a large food-grade plastic bag or cover loosely with plastic wrap.

**8. Place the pans in the refrigerator overnight.**

**9. Remove each pan from the refrigerator 2 hours before you plan to bake** (you can hold them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, baking each pan on a different day, if you wish). Proof the dough for approximately 2 hours at room temperature.

**10.Prepare the oven for hearth baking**, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil and, using your fingertips, make dimples all over the dough, pressing almost to the bottom of the loaf and creating a series of ridges and pockets all over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the top of each loaf. Divide the roasted onion pieces into 2 portions and evenly distribute them over the top of the cheese. Let the dough rest for 15 to 30 minutes.

**11. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan** with semolina flour or cornmeal and very gently transfer the loaves, with or without parchment, to the peel or pan. Slide the loaves onto the baking stone (or bake the loaves directly on the pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, open the door, spray the walls of the oven with water, and close the door. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450°F and bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the bread 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking and continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes. The bread should be golden brown and the cheese melted and brown. The internal temperature of the bread should exceed 195°F, and the loaf should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom. If the cheese seems too brown, but you still need more baking time, cover the top with aluminum foil or a piece of baking parchment to protect the top to gain a few more baking minutes. You may also turn off the oven and let the residual heat continue baking the bread for an additional 10 minutes (again, covering the tops to protect the cheese from burning).

**12. Transfer the finished bread to a rack and cool** for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.

COMMENTARY

This bread takes 3 days to make from start to finish, though the amount of time actually spent on the dough is not that long. _Mise en place,_ as always, is vitally important. Having everything prepared in advance, such as the onions and cheese, will save you from unnecessary stress. Please read the instructions thoroughly before starting, and plan out your steps accordingly.

This dough is made from a wet starter that, in turn, is built from a small amount of barm. This is a large, round, dimpled loaf with lots of big holes in the crumb between the dimples. It requires an oven-roasted onion, baked in a very hot oven, that can be prepared a day or two in advance (or substitute sautéed onions).

The dough is too large for most mixers (other than a Magic Mill), so it is best to make it by hand.

#  RESOURCES

Since the publication of _Crust & Crumb_ in 1998, there has been a proliferation of resources for serious bread bakers. Much of this information appears on new web-sites and in some excellent new books. As more and more home bakers attempt to produce artisan-quality bread, the demand for specialized ingredients and tools has also increased. Culinary and home-chef schools are meeting these needs for cutting-edge knowledge by upgrading their curricula. There is no way to present a list that is truly current, so I ask for forgiveness in advance from any author, school, or other resource that has been inadvertently omitted from the following pages.

## BOOKS

In _Crust & Crumb_ I gave a comprehensive, annotated list of my favorite books. Since then, a number of additional books have been published that belong on that ever-growing list. For the earlier list and commentaries, I refer you to _Crust & Crumb_.

## GRAIN SUPPLIERS

Most flour available in the United States and Canada is excellent. The large mills, like ConAgra, Archer Daniels Midland, and General Mills, all produce high-quality flour, and it is available in most supermarkets. Feel free to use it for the formulas in this book. However, a number of regional mills grind in small batches, with an emphasis on minimal starch damage to the grain (usually by milling with stones or hammer mills, as they grind cooler than the high-speed rollers used by large mills). The following companies offer many varieties of grain, some organically grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers, some commercially grown. Call, visit, or write each for details. Most will ship small quantities; some can supply both home bread makers and artisan bakeries.

Alton Spiller, P.O. Box 696, Los Altos, CA 94023-0696, barmbaker@aol.com (Monica Spiller makes and sells barm kits and sprouted (malted) wheat flour for making strong, healthy wild-yeast starters.)
