**Movie Index**

## **Preface**

About ten years ago, on a whim, we began to collect movies containing mathematics. Now, as a consequence of that whim, we own a library of more than 800 movies on DVD, VHS, 16 mm, Laserdisc, and some strange thing called a CED video disc. The movies range from those expressly about mathematicians, to those that, for whatever reason, just happen to have a snippet of humorous mathematical dialogue.

Over the years, we have found that it is not only professional mathematicians who find the fun in this cinematic mathematics. Just about everybody is charmed by Meg Ryan explaining Zeno's paradox in _I.Q_., Danny Kaye singing about Pythagoras's theorem in _Merry Andrew_ , Lou Costello explaining to Bud Abbott why 7 × 13 = 28 in _In the Navy_ , and so on. Our book, and its accompanying page on our website www.qedcat.com, is an attempt to identify, organize, and engagingly present this fascinating and funny material.

Our intended audience comprises mathematicians, math students, teachers, and more generally anyone who enjoys a Saturday night at the movies (popcorn and all), has some appreciation of mathematics, and has a sense of fun. That is, we're writing for people like ourselves and our friends, raised on a diet of both modern movie-going and mathematical popularizations by the likes of Martin Gardner.

### **Math in the Movies So Far**

There have been a number of previous attempts to organize and popularize movie mathematics. The following are particularly notable:

• A number of excellent websites (all easily found with Google). Most notable are Arnold G. Reinhold's The Math in the Movies page and Alex Kasman's Mathematical Fiction page, both containing lists and summaries of movies with mathematical content. Oliver Knill's website is a great source for mathematical movie clips. There are also specialized websites, which are extremely comprehensive: Andrew Nestler's and Sarah J. Greenwald's terrific website dedicated to mathematics in _The Simpsons_ ; the math section of the Spanish website La Indoblable Página de Bender Bending Rodriguez, dedicated to mathematics in _Futurama_ ; and Wolfram's Numb3rs website, dedicated to math in the TV series _NUMB3RS_.

• A number of mathematical movie festivals, in particular that organized by Michele Emmer and Michele Mulazzani in Bologna in 2000, and the Cinemath festival organized by Robert Osserman and Michael Singer in Berkeley in 2002.

• Several articles about mathematics in the movies by some of the most well known popularizers of mathematics, including Keith Devlin and Ivars Peterson.

• The books and articles by Michele Emmer.

• The very comprehensive Spanish book _Las Matemáticas en el Cine_ by Alfonso Jesús Población Sáez (Spanish Mathematical Society, 2006). Alfonso also has a companion _Cine y mathemàticas_ website.

• The book _The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics_ by Keith Devlin and Gary Lorden (Plume, 2007).

### **Our Book**

Our goal is to complement and significantly extend the available information about math in the movies. There is no intention to be truly encyclopedic and to document every last occurrence of math in the movies. There are simply too many boring scenes that are better left unmentioned. Also, except for a few compelling references, we have tended to stick to the movies and to leave TV alone. In particular, we have included only a small fraction of the wonderful math in _The Simpsons_ , _Futurama_ , and _Numb3rs_. These are huge and worthy projects in themselves, and all have been successfully accomplished elsewhere.

We have, however, attempted to be functionally encyclopedic: in conjunction with our website, we have endeavored to hunt down and to describe all the "good stuff," the scenes we believe are of general appeal and usefulness. Furthermore, our emphasis is really on the math and the fun of seeing it on the big screen, not on anything else. The flipside is that our book probably offers little to experts in cinema studies and serious movie critics.

Our source material ranges from the hilariously nonsensical to very nice adaptations of beautiful mathematics. The movies vary from _1984_ , containing just one (critical) line of mathematical dialogue, to a movie such as _π_ , which has math in almost every scene.

To gain control of all this material, to get a proper sense of "what is there," we began with some serious organization and documentation:

• Systematically excerpting and commenting on relevant dialogues, screen shots, directors' comments on DVDs, published interviews, and so on.

• Reconstructing the content of blackboards, exam papers, and the like, which appear in the various scenes.

• Identifying mistakes and making what sense we could of confusing scenes.

• Reviewing all the documentation and commentary we could find on movie mathematics, including the websites and writings mentioned above.

• Whenever possible, interviewing mathematicians who acted as consultants for the movies.

• Checking out novels and plays, where movies were based on such sources.

When we set out to write this book, we intended to cover everything, and given the amount of material we've looked at we could probably do just that—in twenty thick volumes. We contemplated various ways of managing the material, for instance by restricting ourselves to feature movies. However, doing so would have excluded many highlights.

After experimenting with various formats, we decided on a collage approach. So we worked on creating self-contained chapters, permitting the chapters to differ radically in terms of content, style, and language. This allowed us to style each chapter as seemed best for the specific material.

Some of the chapters are based on a theme (for example, the fourth dimension or infinity); in these chapters we thread the relevant material from different movies into mathematical surveys, with the aim of both informing and entertaining. Other chapters are built around a single very mathematical movie, such as _π_ or _Good Will Hunting_ ; these chapters are as much stories of the movies as of the specific mathematics. Two final sections contain annotated lists of movies according to their content: real mathematicians, famous actors playing mathematicians, geometry, probability, and so on.

### **Our Website**

Some movie math is really, _really_ dull. Even limiting to the good stuff, trying to cram everything into this one book would have resulted in a bloated, boring mess. However, we did want to be comprehensive, and to make available as much of our source material as possible. To that end, on our website www.qedcat.com we have listed each of the 800+ math movies we have seen, together with a capsule summary of each. Our website also includes excerpted dialogues from many of the movies and links to many movie clips. This material is freely available to anyone interested.

As we learn of movies, new and old, we will add details to our website. By doing so, we hope to extend our book and to keep it up to date.

### **How to Get Copies of the Movies and Clips**

This is a book about movies. So, to properly appreciate many parts of the book, it really helps to have seen the movies we're discussing. This is particularly true for the chapters dedicated to individual movies, such as _A Beautiful Mind_ and _Good Will Hunting_.

Ideally this book would have been complemented by a DVD containing mathematical snippets from the movies, but it proved impossible to obtain the necessary permissions. Fortunately, with the increasing popularity of DVDs, and with online video sites such as YouTube, many of the best movie math scenes are now very easy to find. To facilitate this, on our website we maintain a list of links to many of the clips.

### **Acknowledgments**

We would like to thank our many friends and colleagues who spotted math in the movies for us.

Many thanks to the math consultants of various movies who generously gave their time to talk or write to us about their experiences: Len Adleman ( _Sneakers_ ), Dave Bayer ( _A Beautiful Mind_ ), Benedict H. Gross ( _It's My Turn_ ), Tom Kuiper and Linda Wald ( _Contact_ ), Patrick O'Donnell ( _Good Will Hunting_ ), Henry C. Pinkham ( _The Mirror Has Two Faces_ ), and David W. Pravica ( _Cube_ ).

We would also like to thank Jean Doyen and Michele Emmer for their very helpful advice; Hendrik van Maldeghem for translating Dutch dialogue from _Antonia's Line_ ; the Statens Ljud-Och Bildarkiv in Stockholm for making available a copy of _Berget på Månenes Baksida_ ; David Alciatore for his expert insights on the game of billiards and the diamond system; David Thompson for his thoughts on the origins of the Abbott and Costello arithmetic routine; Vincent Burke, Trevor Lipscombe, and Jennifer Slater, our editors at the Johns Hopkins University Press, for their efforts in seeing this book through to publication; Narayanan Sabapathy for his very careful proofreading of a final draft; and Jeff Ross for his brotherly dedication to critiquing and proofreading.

Finally, our huge thanks to Anu and Ying, for their invaluable advice, infinite patience, and inestimable support.

## **Part I  
Movies**

### **Watch the movies!**

Part I is devoted to some of the most famous mathematical movies, such as _π_ and _Good Will Hunting_. Most of these movies are readily available on DVD, and we have written the chapters with the assumption that the reader has watched the movies.

Exceptions are the relatively obscure _It's My Turn_ (chapter 12), and the episode "Hot House" of the Australian TV series _City Homicide_ (chapter 8). In case you cannot find DVDs of these, our website includes links to clips and transcripts of the major mathematical scenes, and more background information.

Two exceptions of a different kind are the famous jugs problem in _Die Hard: With a Vengeance_ (1995) (chapter 9); and the discussion of one of the most famous and funny mathematical movie scenes, in which Lou Costello convinces Bud Abbott, that 7 × 13 = 28 (chapter 10). Clips of these scenes are easy to find, and there are also links on our website.

### **Chapter 1  
Good Math Hunting**

Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a mathematical wunderkind. Will has no formal mathematical education, and when we first encounter him as a twenty-year-old in _Good Will Hunting_ (1997), he is working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Will solves a couple of (supposedly) difficult problems left on a blackboard by the math professor Lambeau (Stellan Starsgård). Lambeau is suitably impressed and tries to help Will sort out his somewhat messed up life. To this end, Lambeau enlists the help of his psychologist colleague, Sean (Robin Williams).

This is not really a movie about mathematics or mathematicians, but there is plenty of math to be spotted. In fact, having talked to Patrick O'Donnell, a professor of physics at the University of Toronto and the man responsible for most of the mathematics in the movie, we think it would have been great to have included a "math consultant's commentary" on the DVD.

One of our goals here is to provide this missing commentary, a fascinating peek behind the scenes of the mathematical making of _Good Will Hunting_. This commentary is based on our telephone interview with Patrick O'Donnell, who turns out to be a raconteur. In order to capture the spirit and the fun of O'Donnell's anecdotes, the following is a fairly literal transcript of the relevant parts of the interview.

A second goal of this chapter is to explain the mathematics behind the problems that Will solves. These problems turn out to be quite accessible to anybody unintimidated by matrices. However, any reader should feel free to skip our forays into "higher" mathematics: none of the mathematics is required to appreciate either the movie or Patrick O'Donnell's engaging commentary.

#### **1.1 How to Become a Math Consultant**

O'DONNELL: "First of all, the really funny thing is how I became the consultant. A bunch of graduate students and some of our faculty here went out for lunch near the university. We were sitting in this little Vietnamese restaurant and this man and these two women came in and sat near us. The man kept looking at me and I thought: 'He must know me or something or I know him.'

"Anyway, we left the restaurant and were walking up the street. About twenty feet up the street or so, one of these two women came running up to me and said, 'We're making a movie and the director would like to have you as an extra. Would you agree?' I said, 'Oh sure that sounds good,' and so we went back, they took a photograph, and they asked me what I did.

"About an hour later they turned up at my office. They had tracked me down, it turned out. When they came in, my board was full of jottings and wave functions and things like that, and the director was very impressed by this, I think, and asked me, 'Would you be a consultant?'

"So, the next day Gus Van Sant, the director came back with the script, told me the story, and said he wanted the math to be technically correct but he didn't have to understand it. He didn't want made up things.

"At that stage they had only one math scene written out completely, and that turned out to be totally wrong. It looked like something in number theory, but it had to do with counting patterns and squares of something, and it didn't make sense. So I had to think of something else. However, in the end the replacement we did for that scene didn't get into the movie."

#### **1.2 Actors Versus Blackboards**

O'DONNELL: "One thing I found about Hollywood is that none of the actors could write on a blackboard. Not at all [ _laughs_ ]. Essentially all the writing you see, maybe one wasn't quite, is mine. I did some of it where it really was not appropriate because it was too much of mine.

"In fact, we were invited to New York to the premiere. My wife had seen the dailies in the scenes I am the actor in, but had never seen the rest of the movie. She said to me at one point, 'This is terrible, I see your handwriting everywhere but somebody else is finishing it off!'

"There is one scene (based on a visit by the director to MIT) where he saw two postdocs coming out of a room and there's a board in the corridor, and one wrote something and the other wrote something and they didn't speak, you know. They were communicating through the equations, or whatever they were doing. So, the director wanted a scene like that and I said, 'Just do it the way they do it.'

"Well, by the time it was time to shoot that scene, I had realized that nobody could write. So, I had to dumb it down and dumb it down and dumb it down. All they had to do was score out. I think it was something with factors, one over the other. However, they could not do this and act at the same time.

"So, really, it was dumbed down. In fact, I said to the director, 'Well you just do it the way you describe it. Somebody writes on the board, puts down the chalk and the other person picks it up and writes something.' But he said, 'Oh no, no.' He had these two guys sitting down and it became like a dance and it lasted three minutes or so. In fact the continuity girl said at one point, 'I thought this is only a twenty-second scene' [ _laughs_ ]. And it turned out it _was_ only a twenty-second scene by the time they finished editing it."

#### **1.3 Lambeau, the Fields Medalist**

0:32  
A classroom at Bunker Hill Community College, where Sean teaches psychology.  
 _LAMBEAU: Hello, Sean_.  
 _SEAN: Hey, Gerry. Um—Ladies and Gentlemen, we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau. Fields Medal winner for combinatory mathematics_.  
 _LAMBEAU: Hello_.  
 _SEAN: Anyone know what the Fields Medal is? It's a really big deal. It's like the Nobel Prize for math, except they only give it out once every four years. It's a great thing. It's an amazing honor_.

O'DONNELL: "The other thing was how to treat Lambeau. I mean they were making a big point about him being a Fields medalist. And, in fact, when they first came to me about consulting they had made him a mathematician who had won a Nobel Prize, and you can't do that because Nobel expressly forbade that since his wife or his mistress ran off with a mathematician.

"So Gus said, 'Well, we'll make him a physicist.' Then they went to Boston and met Sheldon Glashow, who is a Nobel Prize winner in physics, and he said, 'No, no you've got to make him a mathematician because you can do this in mathematics like Ramanujan, but you can't have that in physics because you need to know the facts, so to speak, as well.' So they made him back into a Fields medalist at that point. He just took these things on the fly. You know, 'Just do it!'

"The actor who plays Lambeau [ _Stellan Starsgård_ ] worked for many years with Ingmar Bergman. I once asked him, 'How do you find making movies there compared to that.' He said in the movies you can ad lib a lot and extemporize. Well, getting him to change a word was like pulling teeth.

"There was one scene, I call it the Salieri scene ('You are so much greater than me'), and I think in the original script it had something like 'twenty mathematicians in the world can understand this,' which is something that came out of Einstein's days. I remember as a boy my father used to say that only twelve people in the world understood Einstein's theory. I think that came out of the 1930s Chicago science fair or something. It is quite a popular thing, people always say that.

"I tried to get him to change it to 'mathematicians know this,' instead of putting a number to count it, 'cause I said there are not many mathematicians in the world anyway, and so you don't have to say twenty [ _laughs_ ]. Well if you look at that scene in the movie you see he actually falters over it—I got him to agree.

"With Robin Williams everything was made up with him—the scene in the diner where they go up to the table and argue, every shot he changed it. In fact, the part where he says something about the Unabomber, that wasn't in the script originally, and then when he started it he started altering it, playing around with it and asking the barman, 'Who is the Unabomber?' or 'Who is Ted Kaczynski?'—or some variation of that each time. He did improvisations on the script most of the time [ _laughs_ ]."

#### **1.4 A Professor Turns Actor**

O'DONNELL: "I'm the drunk at the bar  _[figure 1.1_ ]. The scene starts with Robin Williams repeating part of a risqué joke that Matt Damon did earlier on, about a stewardess going for coffee, and I'm yelling at him basically. I'm supposed to be this barfly who is sort of really annoyed with life, and then they walk away from me up to a table. It took twelve hours to do that scene. And the next morning it took about five hours to do the argument of the two of them round the table.

"Once you get over the rush of seeing a movie being made, you just leave. It is very boring, actually. Typically in a scene they did maybe six different views of the scene, plus before they start they do something called blocking out, and that is getting people into position, and so on. And when they start filming each of those ways of looking at the scene they might do as many as a hundred takes. So it really can get very tedious after a while.

"It turns out there was another actor by the name of Patrick O'Donnell who plays Marty the custodian. We'd seen the movie in New York just before Christmas and when I got back it came out in Canada, maybe the first week or second week of January. One of my friends in computer science had gone to see it before we went to see it. And so when I was in New York I really didn't pay attention, it was too exciting to follow that stuff, to be taking it all in. But he called me up and said, 'You had two parts in it.' He said, 'You were also a janitor.' I hadn't seen it really at that point. I said, 'No, no, no,' and he said, 'Thank goodness, I thought makeup was good but not that good' [ _laughs_ ]. Anyway I never met that man."

It is worth noting that our O'Donnell (not the janitor) is a multi-movie actor: he also played a math professor in the short film _Infinitely Near_ (1999).

**Fig. 1.1** Patrick O'Donnell (facing the camera), making a cameo as a drunk.

#### **1.5 Mathematics: "Perceval"**

O'DONNELL: "I have a friend, a chemical engineer. He went to see the movie for two reasons. One was to see me and the other was to see my mistakes. And he said, 'I didn't see you.' He's still convinced that the opening scene is a mistake. Because at least in the text books that I had been looking at at the time, it was clear that people now say integral of _f_ , they don't write d _x_. We have always used d _x_ and engineers presumably always use d _x_. He was complaining that was all wrong because there was no d _x_ in any of those integrals.

"I think at the end of that scene on the blackboard, the one thing I was worried about in that one—it was shot in the physics department here in a big lecture hall, and it has four blackboards and what I was really worried about was filling all four blackboards, you know having something on them.

"But I think maybe the last equation is integral mod _f_ squared d _x_ or something. And so what I had to do with Stellan Skarsgård is have him do the last _x_ I think it was, put the period in maybe, but say the words 'integral mod _f_ squared d _x_ " as he kind of did something with the _x_. So there was a d _x_ somewhere. Yes definitely there was a d _x_ in that Parceval theorem. And he mispronounced it and I couldn't get him to fix that one up. Very rigid." [Figure 1.2]

 _LAMBEAU: Mod f squared_ d _x. So, please finish Perceval_.

**Fig. 1.2** Lambeau announces the first superhard problem, and mispronounces "Parseval."

#### **1.6 Students in Action**

It is in the Perceval scene that Lambeau announces the first superhard problem: the problem on the hallway blackboard that we shall see in a moment (figure 1.3). Despite what Lambeau says here, this is not "an advanced Fourier system," but is rather a fairly simple problem from algebraic graph theory.

O'DONNELL: "There were many more scenes [ _filmed_ ] than made it into the movie, and I had no input on the editing. There was, in fact, for this scene, following from what he said, a nifty Fourier problem, filmed in a similar manner to what actually appeared in the movie.

"I had given an exam just the Christmas beforehand, which was a Fourier series question, which is one I rather like because nothing seems to be happening in it. Normally when you do these Fourier series, say with a guitar string that is plucked and then let go. That's a typical one, but this one is a model of a piano where the string is at rest and you bang it a very short impulse with a sharp instrument, and that's all you do. The string's at rest, nothing has happened to the string in terms of distortion, and it's totally at rest except for that little bit.

**Fig. 1.3** In the MIT hallway, Lambeau discovers Will's solution to his problem.

"Anyway I'm writing this up and the professor comes down with a bunch of extras who are students. I'm just about finishing it off and they stop and gather round in a U-shape, and then they have a break and this young guy comes up to me and asks, 'What's that about?' and I say, 'It's a Fourier series' and he asks, 'Do you teach this?' I said, 'I set this as a Christmas exam.' And he said, 'Where?' I said, 'The University of Toronto.' He says, 'I'm in first year in U of T doing physics and math. Would I get a problem like that?' [ _laughs_ ] But that scene didn't get in."

#### **1.7 Mathematics: Graph Theory 1**

The questions on the blackboard relate to the diagram at the top left in figure 1.3. Mathematicians refer to this kind of diagram as a _graph_. Let's consider these four questions in detail. To begin, figure 1.4 is a reconstruction of the graph on the blackboard.

##### **Question 1: Find the adjacency matrix _A_**

Our graph has four vertices (the four little circles), inventively labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. This means that the _adjacency matrix A_ of our graph will be a 4 × 4 matrix: the number in the _i_ th row and _j_ th column of _A_ will be equal to the number of edges connecting vertex _i_ with vertex _j_. So the adjacency matrix for our graph, which Will writes on the blackboard, is

**Fig. 1.4** The graph at the top of the blackboard in figure 1.3.

For example, the two 2s in the matrix stand for the two edges connecting vertices 2 and 3.

##### **Question 2: Find the matrix giving the number of 3-step walks**

If _n_ is any natural number, an _n_ -step walk connecting two vertices is a journey from one of the vertices to the other that includes exactly _n_ edges. (For this counting, an edge is counted as many times as you travel along it.) For example, the matrix _A_ exactly records the numbers of 1-step walks between all the different pairs of vertices of the graph.

One elegant result in graph theory is that the number of _n_ -step walks between the different vertices of the graph is similarly summarized by the _n_ th power of _A_. Lambeau has instructed us to investigate the 3-step walks, and so the matrix we're after is

Now, for example, the 2 in the top left corner of this matrix means that there are exactly two 3-step walks that start and end at vertex 1. These two walks consist of traveling clockwise and counterclockwise around the triangle.

##### **Question 3: Find the generating function for walks from point _i_ → _j_**

Let's consider two vertices, which we shall call _i_ and _j_. Then for any natural number _n_ we can count the number of _n_ -walks from _i_ to _j_ ; in the movie, Will denotes this number by _ω n_( _i_ → _j_ ). For example, between the vertices 1 and 3 we can calculate that there are no 1-walks, two 2-walks, two 3-walks, and so on. The resulting sequence of numbers begins

0, 2, 2, 14, 18, 94, 146, 638, ...

The so-called _generating function_ for this sequence is written as

_Γ ω_( _p_ 1 → _p_ 3, _z_ ).

This stands for the infinite sum

_From here on things get a bit more difficult, and we require some matrix determinants. Basically, what Question 3 is about is finding a way of calculating the generating functions that avoids calculating all those powers of the matrix A. If all this math is new or appears forbidding, there is no harm in your jumping ship and swimming to the next section_.

The generating function _Γ ω_( _p i_ → _p j_, _z_ ) is a function of _z_ , and it turns out that it is always a _rational function_ of _z_ , that is, a ratio of two polynomials. This function turns out to be given by the formula

Here, the **1** stands for the 4×4 identity matrix, and **1** _i, j_ − _zA i, j_ is the ( _i, j_ )th minor of the matrix **1** − _zA_. All that seems to be required for Question 3 is to write down this formula. Note that Will's formula on the blackboard in figure 1.3 is missing the factor (−1) _i_ + _j_ ; as it happens, this does not affect Will's calculation, since he then applies the formula in the case _i_ \+ _j_ = 4, an even number.

##### **Question 4: Find the generating function for walks from point 1→3**

So, Question 4 asks us to apply the formula in Question 3 to the special case of vertices 1 and 3. We calculate the generating function:

On the blackboard we can only see the denominator of the first fraction. But it seems Will gets it right, and his correct answer to the question is

2 _z_ 2 \+ 2 _z_ 3 \+ 14 _z_ 4 \+ 18 _z_ 5 \+ 94 _z_ 6 \+ _···_.

#### **1.8 Mathematics: Eigenvalues**

**Fig. 1.5** Lambeau in front of blackboards full of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

O'DONNELL: "Basically, I followed the script in the sense that if they said they were going to talk about eigenvalues or something, I made up something with eigenvalues. In the second big lecture hall scene I knew they were going to start with him saying, after the mysterious person hadn't turned up, that there were a lot of people present that weren't in his class, and so if those people did not want three hours of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, they should leave.

"I took that just the way I'd teach a class here, to have nothing on the board to begin with. I would start the lecture with a blank board. But Gus said to me, 'We need something on the board.'

"So for that scene I had no notes made up at all, because I didn't expect I would be doing anything. I put a 3 × 3 matrix on the board that comes from dealing with three balls coupled with four strings, say one on either side. I wrote that down on the board and I wrote some garbage somewhere else, and on another board I used words like eigenvalues and eigenvectors all over the place. And then Gus came to me and said, 'No, we're taking a shot of him, and the board over his left shoulder is blank. We need that filled in, too.'

"So, if you look at that scene you see the words 'eigenvectors' and 'eigenvalues' everywhere because I just had to fill in the boards with something. But what we didn't expect was that the professor when he finished would come to the board and rub out the bottom board. That was not called for at that point.

"Usually the props manager takes a Polaroid of things in a scene. So that if they had to reshoot it, they know exactly what was there, a red coathanger beside a blue coathanger or whatever. But here he had done that so quickly in the first rehearsal that the props guy hadn't had a chance to take [ _the Polaroids_ ] and I only remembered a bit of it, and of course I wasn't sure whether I could do the same thing again.

"But eventually it turned out that they had washed the boards before they had started, and so I could see a faint outline of what I had written, so I could fill in the matrix okay. And then I was about to leave when this girl came running out, one of the extras and she said, 'The last time you had _A_ = the matrix' [ _laughs_ ]. We were saved because then we could take a photograph of it. I could do it each time."

#### **1.9 Mathematics: Graph Theory 2**

O'DONNELL: "I think in the script the director had made a reference that he was going to set a superhard problem. So, when I came across this paper by Harary on graph theory, I realized that it was just perfect for people who can't write on the blackboard.

"These graphs, you could color them, use color chalk, for example. We decided the graph that Will could do best is the one that looks like the letters _H_ and _K_ stuck together, and all he had to do was draw the line of both the _H_ and the _K_. I thought that covered both having a research type problem and still overcoming this writing on the blackboard problem."

**Fig. 1.6** The second set of 'superhard' problems has again been solved.

Let's have a close look at the two questions on the blackboard.

##### **Question 1: How many trees are there with _n_ labeled nodes?**

Here, a _tree_ means a connected graph with no loops. The question is then: Jotting down _n_ points on a piece of paper, how many essentially different trees are there with these points as vertices? The answer, known as _Cayley's theorem_ , turns out to be _n_ _n_ −2. For example, figure 1.7 shows the 44−2 = 16 different types of trees that can span four points in the plane.

**Fig. 1.7** The sixteen different spanning trees connecting four points in the plane.

##### **Question 2: Draw all homeomorphically irreducible trees with _n_ = 10 (vertices)**

A homeomorphically irreducible tree is one in which each vertex has either one or more than three edges ending in it. Will is in the process of drawing an eighth tree when he is interrupted. The complete list consists of the ten trees pictured in figure 1.8.

**Fig. 1.8** The ten homeomorphically irreducible trees with ten vertices.

#### **1.10 Mathematics: Graph Theory 3**

0:26  
Lambeau and Will are doing math together (figure 1.9).

**Fig. 1.9** Will calculates the chromatic polynomial of a graph.

Will completes the formula on the blackboard by adding the factor ( _k_ −2)6 to the numerator, to arrive at

Will and Lambeau take turns canceling common factors in the fraction, simplifying the expression.

What they are doing here is calculating the _chromatic polynomial P G_( _k_ ) of the graph _G_ on the left of the blackboard. Here, _P G_( _k_ ) is defined as the number of ways to color the vertices of the graph with _k_ colors, so that no two vertices in the graph connected by an edge have the same color. And, indeed,

_P G_( _k_ ) = _k_ ( _k_ − 1)( _k_ − 2)4

is correct, the result of their canceling extravaganza.

For example, this formula tells us that there are no legal colorings using only one color (well, duh) or only two colors. It also tells us that there are six legal colorings using three colors. Figure 1.10 shows a legal coloring/numbering of the graph with three colors. The other possible three-colorings are simply obtained by cycling through the six permutations of the three colors.

**Fig. 1.10** Labeling with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 so that no edge has vertices with the same number.

#### **1.11 Mathematics: The Salieri Scene**

O'DONNELL: "In the scene in which the young Will overthrows the famous old 'Hungarian'  _[figure 1.11_ ]—in the script they call him Alexander Pekec [ _perhaps a stand-in for the famous mathematician Paul Erdös?_ ]. I decided to emulate Richard Feynman's 1948 meeting at the Oppenheimer conference, beautifully described in Freeman Dyson's book _Disturbing the Universe_ , in which he describes Julian Schwinger and Dick Feynman as the young Turks giving Neils Bohr and other worthies the new quantum electrodynamics.

"Although the immediate outcome of that meeting was the opposite of that in the movie (Feynman was stunned and depressed by the response to his way of doing QED without equations), the [ _eventual_ ] outcome was indeed the same—most physicists now use Feynman diagrams. I decided to make an invention which looked like both graph theory/combinatorics and Feynman diagrams, to counteract the 'old way' of heavy complicated mathematics. So, you may see something vaguely familiar but with something wrong/irrelevant, but have fun inventing this scene in your own way."

Thus ends Patrick O'Donnell's wonderful telling of his excellent movie adventure.

Kleitman, Daniel J., My Career in the movies, Sidebar to Mark Saul's review of _Good Will Hunting_ , _Notices of the American Mathematical Society_ 45 (1998), 502. Daniel J. Kleitman is professor of mathematics at MIT. This short article tells of his role as math adviser for the initial script of the movie and his appearance in the background of one of the scenes. In fact, he walks by the window twice in this scene. First from right to left, then from left to right; see figure 1.12.

#### **1.13 Parodies**

Its story line makes _Good Will Hunting_ ripe for parodying. A pretty good job is done in the episode "A Genius Among Us" (1999) of the Disney cartoon series _Recess_. A very quick but much funnier parody appears in the episode "Don's New Flatmate" of the British TV series _How Not to Live Your Life_ (2009). Here, the doltish Eddie adds the (correct) single line _a_ = _b_ to the tree-filled blackboard, which is later declared to be a great breakthrough (figure 1.13).

### **Chapter 2  
The Clever Hand Behind _A Beautiful Mind_**

_A Beautiful Mind_ (2001) tells the story of John Nash, mathematical genius and winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize for economics, and his struggle with schizophrenia. The movie is very unusual in that the main character is a living mathematician and in that the story is only loosely connected to actual events. Like _Good Will Hunting_ , this is a movie more about psychology than mathematics. However, mathematics and mathematicians are portrayed in the movie in a way that rings true and amounts to a self-contained artistic piece within the larger whole. The man responsible for getting it so beautifully right is David Bayer, a professor of mathematics at Columbia University in New York City.

Our goal here, as in chapter 1 on _Good Will Hunting_ , will be to provide something in the nature of a math consultant's commentary. It is based upon several sources: newspaper reports featuring David Bayer, our own interview with him, and a recording of a conversation between Robert Osserman (then director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute), Sylvia Nassar, and David Bayer.

We'll stick to David Bayer's words as much as possible, adding screen shots, footnotes, and commentaries when they add some clarification. _As in the previous chapter, some of the commentary and discussion refers to high level mathematics. We encourage the reader to simply skip over any section that feels too heavy_.

In 2000, David Bayer was asked to write a review of the Broadway play _Proof_ for the _Notices of the American Mathematical Society_. Ron Howard, who read and was impressed by this review, became the director of _A Beautiful Mind_. He invited David Bayer for an interview, which went so well that Howard hired him on the spot as the mathematics consultant for the movie. Bayer's role was multifarious: producing the writings on the blackboards and windows; contributing parts of the dialogue that involved mathematics; writing a program for the Pentagon scene, which was supposed to suggest how Nash's mind picks out patterns from seeming chaos; acting as Russell Crowe's hand double; being present as consultant whenever Crowe was acting in a math scene; consulting on the games of Go and Hex; and actually acting as one of the professors (the third in line) in the pen-presentation ceremony toward the end of the movie (figure 2.1). Between February and June 2001 Bayer spent hundreds of hours on this movie; given the very impressive results, many mathematicians, especially David Bayer himself, consider this time very well spent.

**Fig. 2.1** Math consultant David Bayer (right), appearing in the pen-presentation scene.

Anyone interested in finding out more about John Nash and his mathematics should read Sylvia Nasar's excellent biography and the annotated collection of John Nash's (very difficult) papers, edited by Harold W. Kuhn and Sylvia Nasar. The American Mathematical Society has also published some enlightening reviews of the movie and Nasar's book, from a mathematician's point of view.

#### **2.1 Real Math Beats Fake Math**

David Bayer begins his story: "I was under the impression that I was given much more resources to inject math into the movie _A Beautiful Mind_ [ _in comparison to consultants working on other movies_ ]. Generally the point of view is that mathematics is inserted in specific scenes, whereas the motivation for Ron Howard coming to me for consulting was that you can't make up reality—that there will be a certain vérité to having as much math involved as possible, even if most people who watch the movie wouldn't understand a word of the math. I've had various people observe me doing math under various circumstances over the years and not understand a word of what I was doing, but still be drawing intense conclusions about my behavior.

"And in some sense, that's our view of what happens when you make the movie. You know, millions of people were in the theatre in a couple of hours' session of intense concentration and they are all observing, bringing different points of view to the observation. And you can't fake the reality that you would get from them actually giving me the time to do actual mathematics, even though it is on a board that is just going to be glanced at."

#### **2.2 Signature Scene**

BAYER: "Actually I brought some baggage with me, because I know of so many mathematicians who joke that they can solve the blackboards in _Good Will Hunting_ while they are on screen. It is sort of fairly popular to discount it as easy graph theory, or whatever it is. So, there was a signature scene, which was analogous to that in _A Beautiful Mind_. Not a signature scene from the point where I contributed, but more when they came to me, this was forefront in their minds, something they were worried about. In the script, Russell Crowe gives some problem to this class which then Jennifer Connelly comes into his office to give a solution for, right?"

##### **Setting a Trap**

BAYER: "I was fearful when they asked me for this that people would be ripping whatever problem [ _Bayer produced_ ], the same way they were ripping the _Good Will Hunting_ scene. So I kind of rigged a trap with the problem. You know, basically, Ron Howard encouraged me to think like an actor, I mean he actually loves actors and everything he does is fundamentally an actor's medium. You can hear him discuss this point if you listen to his director's commentary on the DVD, sort of, in the first library scene where there is math. So, I put myself in the character the same way that I did everything else thereafter and thought, 'What is it about multivariable calculus that gets near something of deep interest?' And there is this one aspect of topology, which is the shapes of things.

**Fig. 2.2** Nash sets a problem that will take months, or "the term of your natural lives."

"How can you measure when things are different shapes? There is a fact in multivariable calculus which is nearly true, but not quite true, and it fails if the space you are working on is a strange shape. In that exact era [ _in which Nash worked_ ], DeRham was noticing it and first published papers that if you view this defect as an attribute, you could actually use it as a tool to measure the shapes of space. This is DeRham cohomology.

"So I thought about it, and the way this is scripted is that he walks into this room, and he really has not been thinking about teaching this class at all. He is just winging it, and what would I think about on the way over if I was winging a class like that? Why do you want to do this? What is interesting about this? This is the one fact that comes to mind. So the problem that he puts of the blackboard is effectively to calculate—I mean it's been so compressed to fit into the scene, it is almost cryptic. But basically it is a question about calculating the cohomology around some subset removed from  3.

"So now, it turns out that the answer depends on what your category is. If you, say, have two lines which meet in a plane, and if you are thinking as an algebraic geometer, then you can't really have a pole around half of a line without having a pole around the other half of the line. You get one answer, whereas if you think as an analyst, you _can_ certainly have partitions of unity, and have something really wacky happen on one half and not have it happen on the other half, and you get a different answer. And actually one of the algebraic geometers at Columbia gave as I was expecting the algebraic geometry answer. So basically I was trying to trap anybody, and I think that many people actually took the bait."

##### **Acting Mathematics**

BAYER: "Russell had actually been very nervous the day that he did the math lecture, where he wrote the problem out and talked to Jennifer at the same time in the classroom. And everybody was sitting there astounded: 'You mathematicians really talk and write at the same time?' Here we are taking like twenty takes and no one was thinking that Russell was a yahoo and everyone is extremely impressed with it. They were basically feeling sympathetic with him that he was trying to pull that scene and they are looking at me: 'You guys do this? You gotta be kidding.'

"Oh, by the way, they faked the book that is thrown into the wastebasket with my name as the author on it [Calculus of Several Variables _by D.A. Bayer_ ]. This was a standard trick because you want to make sure that someone won't sue. Russell realized halfway through that scene that he is throwing my book into the trash. He acted momentarily like he was putting in a little bit too much zeal. He had a bet running with the prop guy that he could make the shot without hitting the basketball rim. He realizes that he would trash my book and he gave me this funny quizzical look: 'Are you okay with this?' 'Yeah it's a cameo, it's okay. Go.' "

##### **On the Importance of Getting It Right**

BAYER: "I hung around whenever there was math involved. It was almost like it was an entitlement that whenever Russell Crowe was on the set and there was possibly math in the scene I would be available, in case he wanted to ask me a question. Whenever the prop department wanted to decorate the scene with stray math they wanted me around to make stuff fresh for them. So that made me be around an awful lot.

"Russell Crowe asked me to come in during the scene in the office with Jennifer Connelly [ _in which Connelly shows her solution to the problem_ ], to point to where on the page he would be glancing at to know that she had done it wrong, and I basically pointed at the middle of the page. Then Jennifer Connelly looks at me and asks me pretty much in these words, 'Are you making me look like a yahoo here? How bad is my answer?' And I explained, 'Actually it's a pretty high-level mistake. I got a Columbia professor to make the same mistake.' She liked that."

##### **Blackboards and Windows**

BAYER: "Certainly one of the more stressful points for me was just early on. The script has the scene where we are doodling on the library window. There are three panes, one of pigeons in the park and the third one is of observing a mugging. And I had to decide how to decorate the window  _[figure 2.3_ ].

**Fig. 2.3** Window doodles, of a pigeon cluster (left) and a purse being stolen (right).

"There is no really literal answer here, in that it was a bit of a stretch even in character to imagine John Nash doing it exactly as it was portrayed dramatically here. And what would the math look like of analyzing pigeons in the park, which was actually a little bit different from game theory, but it might be game theory. I struggled with it, and Ron wanted to see what I was going to do, and it would ruin a day's filming if I didn't do something. He was getting nervous as it was getting close: 'Hey Dave go use my trailer. I want to see something in four hours. Nothing is going to happen here, you know.'

"And ultimately I ended up actually writing out a storyline for myself what was taking place. I started translating it into graphs and then I started putting values like I was writing a game theory puzzle on the graph. And even though I don't know of game theorists doing exactly this to such a storyline, that was the basis for my drawing. My drawing, if you look at it close enough is actually quite literal  _see the right closeup in[figure 2.3_]. It is some story of a mugging and that's what they wanted. I think there is a tendency for mathematicians to be somewhat dogmatic and too literal minded. There is a kind of relaxation that had to take place for me to pull that off."

#### **2.3 The Riemann Hypothesis**

BAYER: "In the second part of the movie, rather than being realistic to what happened to John Nash and his math, which was scattered, they wanted to have a consistent storyline where he'd make incremental progress toward the Riemann hypothesis."

##### **Riemann on the Porch**

BAYER: "The first moment where you see this is when he is sitting on the porch and Saul comes by, he doesn't want to take his pills in public and he's got this clipboard. He hands Saul the clipboard (figure 2.4), Saul glances at it and says: 'Well, you know, maybe there are other things in life besides math.' You actually do a closeup on the clipboard a little bit long and John Nash wrote me an email: 'What was on that clipboard?'

"It was supposed to be in some sense numerological gibberish, but he had the sense that it wasn't quite gibberish, and he wanted me to tell him what it was. And he was right, it wasn't quite gibberish. I tried to think wildly, but in character. And something that fascinates some people, and may not be a mainstream approach to the Riemann hypothesis, sort of struck me as relevant. There is the way continued fractions behave differently than our usual view of numbers. Well actually there was a bunch of numerology involved in continued fractions on that sheet of paper."

**Fig. 2.4** There are two pages that Saul looks at on the porch. The first (not shown) is filled with what appear to be random numbers, and what John is obviously trying to do is pick out some patterns. The writing on the second page (shown above) appears more coherent: the expression on the left looks like a somewhat unusual way of writing a continued fraction. Part of what is happening on the right looks a little bit like the first few prime numbers (circled) being generated using _the Sieve of Eratosthenes_ , or attempts to discover something about the prime numbers, by highlighting patterns among the primes and among the nonprime integers.

##### **Riemann in the Lecture Theatre**

BAYER: "Then we transport the Columbia lecture to Harvard, for the scene where he breaks down and gets taken to the asylum. I realized that the three boards I was filling there were likely to be scrutinized closely by number theorists, and therefore I tried to put a stutter step in the first board  _[figure 2.5_ ], so that anybody who was reading it really closely would just be thrown on board one and would just run out of time before they got to board two  _[figure 2.6_ ] or board three. At least until they get the DVD.

"He starts saying something which the audience thinks is crazy, something along the lines of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function corresponding to singularities in space-time. Okay, this is a very polarizing comment. First of all the quaternions generalize the complex numbers, and who knows maybe it would be profitable to reconsider the Riemann hypothesis for the quaternions. It might be easier if you generalize it properly. In any case, theoretical physics already got into the character's mind and there is this loose connection.

**Fig. 2.5** A closeup of the first of the three blackboards in the Columbia lecture. At the very top are the two most famous ways of expressing the Riemann zeta function _ζ_ ( _s_ ). The quantity _s_ = _σ_ \+ i _t_ is a complex variable, indicated at the top right. The zeta function is zero when _s_ = −2, −4, −6,.... The _Riemann hypothesis_ asserts that all other zeros have real part   The infinite sum   at the top left also makes a later appearance; there, John is riding his bicycle in the form of an infinity sign which transforms into the infinity of the sum.

One connection of the Riemann zeta function with prime numbers is visible in the expression   which is known as the _Euler product formula_. This is an infinite product in which _p_ stands for the prime numbers. The second line is the equation   which captures an important symmetry of the zeta function. The third line involves another very prime-heavy function, the so-called _Möbius function μ_. The stutter step mentioned by David Bayer, involving a weird continued fraction expansion, is visible at the bottom of the blackboard.

"I view insanity as a partial gift, in that it allows one to make looser formal associations, that you are making an analogy between space-time and quaternions was the basis for making up that line. I tried it on Brian Green, who I greatly respect, he is a friend of mine at Columbia. He gave me the wildest look when I tried that line on him, and the minute I saw that look I thought 'Okay, that has to be the line in the movie.' But of course various people trashed that. It's not correct. It is not correct mathematics, but it is in character."

**Fig. 2.6** A closeup of the second of the three blackboards in the Columbia lecture. This one is concerned with the connection between the Riemann hypothesis and the distribution of the prime numbers. The important bits, in the upper left corner, are _π_ ( _x_ ) (the number of primes less than or equal to   and the expression _O_ ( _x_ ½ log _x_ ). The Riemann hypothesis being true is equivalent to the second equation being true. This second equation says that the complicated function _π_ ( _x_ ) is approximated by the simpler function li( _x_ ), within an accuracy of _O_ ( _x_ ½ log _x_ ). That is, the Riemann hypothesis being true is equivalent to there existing a constant _C_ such that | _π_ ( _x_ ) − li( _x_ ) | ≤ _Cx_ ½ log _x_ for all positive numbers _x_.

##### **Riemann in the Library**

BAYER: "There is finally the board which probably had the most scrutiny in this theme, when he is in the library and the young kid comes and sees him and figures he is working on the Riemann hypothesis  _[figure 2.7_ ]. There I needed to do something that could possibly be stared at in great length.

"I used two devices. First of all, Deligne had made progress over finite fields during that exact decade, and there are even to this day some number theorists who think that is a not a bad parallel for how you would approach the general problem, that one should work with noncommutative rings, etc., and basically what I did was make a very free-association transcription of Deligne's work.

**Fig. 2.7** A student talks to John in the library.

"There are functions on the board whose definitions don't appear, so that if the blackboard was computer code you couldn't compile it, because you wouldn't know certain definitions. Which means, in particular, you could never prove me wrong. What it is intended to be for that moment is plausible progress for the proof of the Riemann hypothesis, which I found challenging to come up with (and I got help from various people). It was funny, if I knew of a proof of the Riemann hypothesis there is a thing called the Clay Prize, so Akiva Goldman the writer kept joking with me about that theme: 'So Dave, if you figure the Riemann hypothesis out, this is where you can put it in the film' [ _laughs_ ].

"The part that is personal about that for me is that when I was a graduate student, at first-year graduate school at Harvard. I was taking Galois theory with Barry Mazur, and Graeme Segal was visiting. And he taught topology, and it kind of blew my mind when I first realized that somehow covering spaces for topological spaces and Galois extension fields were fundamentally the same thing.

"This is sort of this moment as a graduate student, you know the way you are when you are a first year graduate student, and things are just amazing to you. This is one of the things that was amazing to me, and so I put those words in the student's mouth who approaches Nash. Except that in the scene, the student feels that he has thought of this by himself and does not realize that we already know this.

"In a way if someone is coming uncharitably at the film, then it is a challenging delivery because the actor did a great job of being right on the edge of like, you know, 'Is this guy a prodigy or wacko or what the hell?' And his delivery, you are not sure how you are supposed to read it if you trying to sit there and break down the math.

"But my point of view was that I don't care. And basically I'll do things in character, and if it is in character to risk drawing criticism, I knew that the character drawing criticism was happy to take it. I see myself as having done my job if I can have a character say something like that."

##### **Riemann Erased**

BAYER: "I had to come up with some kind of calculation related to the Riemann hypothesis, but you know something I could do naturally myself. It was way too involved for me to do from plans. I basically just ensconced myself in the room for six hours and started scribbling on boards, trying calculations and looking for early visual calculational tools—I went around the room about six times, and every time I went back I would use spaces in between what I had done before, erase something more, and so built up this pastiche.

"So, Ron had to go into the room for a different reason, looking through the window down into a scene they were shooting. He'd come back, he's thrilled with this. We get into the room in the afternoon finally and Russell looks around, and according to the script he is supposed to go and add a line or two to it. However, this did not feel right to Russell. 'I think what I should do is look at this from the hallway, do a lot of reflection, then turn around and erase the board' and he grins: 'I would have wrecked Dave Bayer's whole afternoon'  _[figure 2.8_ ].

"So Ron, basically now he is thinking cinematographer, because in any given take the guy holding the focus ring can get it wrong, or there can be dots on the negative, or whatever. So, basically, 'I tell you what, we do a couple of takes where you just go up to the board—and then we'll do a take where you erase.'

"Now I had to get out of the room, it's a tiny room. They do a few practice runs and they are like shouting back and forth: 'Can you erase?' 'Yeah.' 'Can you erase?' 'Yeah.' You know that's funny. Finally they go for it and then Ron comes bounding up the stairs and he says, 'Dave how long would it take to do that again?' It was a really visibly pulled punch. He did not want me for an instant to think he was serious, that he didn't appreciate that it actually did take me six hours. But it was so funny everyone cracked up."

#### **2.4 The Blonde and the Nobel Prize**

A pivotal moment of the movie is the bar scene, in which a blonde bombshell and her friends enter the bar, and John has a brainstorm:

0:19  
 _JOHN: Adam Smith needs revision.  
MARTIN: What are you talking about?  
JOHN: If we all go for the blonde, we block each other. Not a single one of us is going to get her. So, then we go for her friends, but they will all give us the cold shoulder because nobody likes to be second choice. Well, what if no one goes for the blonde? We don't get in each other's way, and we don't insult the other girls. That's the only way we win. That's the only way we all get laid. Adam Smith said: "The best result comes from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself." Right, that's what he said. Incomplete. Okay? Because the best result will come from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself and the group.  
MARTIN: If this is some way for you to get the blonde, go to hell.  
JOHN: Governing dynamics. Adam Smith was wrong_.

At this point Nash rushes off. What he had supposedly hit upon are the fundamentally new ideas about noncooperative games that were the subject of the (real) Nash's PhD thesis. Mathematicians use noncooperative games to model real-life scenarios such as arms races, the stock market, and so on. Nash's ideas proved extremely influential, enough to earn him the Nobel Prize for economics in 1994.

To get a sense of the mathematics intended to be behind this scene, let's first have a look at a simple example of a noncooperative game. In this game, three players try to win money from a pot. For each play of the game, the players simultaneously stick out 1 or 2 fingers. Then the rules are:

• If only one player sticks out 1 finger, that player wins $1 from the pot.

• If only one player sticks out 2 fingers, that player wins $4 from the pot.

• In all other cases, nobody wins or loses anything.

The four possible finger combinations (up to rearranging the players) are

(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 1).

In his PhD thesis, Nash introduced and investigated the concept of what is now called a _Nash equilibrium_ of a noncooperative game. This is an outcome of a game that leaves all players "happy," or at least "not unhappy," in the following sense: none of the players could have increased their winnings by _unilaterally_ changing their decision, with the other players leaving their decisions unchanged.

In our finger game, (2,1,1) is a Nash equilibrium: certainly, the person playing 2 fingers could not have done better; also, if either of the players who played 1 finger switched to 2 fingers, she would still not get anything, and so would not do better. Similarly, (1,2,2) is a Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, (1,1,1) and (2,2,2) are clearly not Nash equilibria.

It turns out that not every noncooperative game has such a simple equilibrium. However, things change for the better (mathematically) if we play such a game repeatedly and consider different _mixed strategies_. A mixed strategy is one where each player chooses from their options randomly, but with certain fixed probabilities. By including mixed strategies, we can then consider Nash equilibria for repeated games, and Nash proved that such equilibria _always_ exist. In our game, one such equilibrium corresponds to all three players going for 1 finger   of the time, and going for 2 fingers the other   of the time.

Now, how does all this fit in with what is going on in the scene with the blonde? Here are David Bayer's thoughts.

BAYER: "The bar scene is not considered to be a very good example of game theory, nor is it considered a good example of specifically explaining the Nash equilibrium. Harold Kuhn, who is a contemporary of Nash and a good friend of his, and also served as an advisor [ _on the movie_ ] had been going back and forth, trying to convince Akiva to rewrite that scene completely.

"Harold Kuhn's explanation, while mathematically far more sound, served to illustrate why he is a mathematician and not a screenwriter. It was taking all that Akiva had put into the scene out of the scene. When I came on board there was this kind of sheepishness: 'Okay, when you look at the script there is this bar scene. Now, we know it's wrong. Can you stay on the job if this is the scene?' I didn't choose to fight that fight. I actually thought about it and I liked the scene in the movie. For me, everything I was doing was in character.

"John Milnor. He came five minutes late to his first class for graph theory as a freshman, and there was a problem on the board. So he dutifully came into the next class and I think, as the legend goes, he said 'I think I am not cut out for this after all.' Because [ _the problem_ ] was a lot harder than he thought it was, but he got it. Of course, it was an open problem and it became his first paper.

"This is kind of in the legendary landscape in Nash's mind, in that Nash in the movie came gradually to his final understanding of Nash equilibrium. But Nash, like anybody, would love to have this story be told about him.

"You can say that in some sense Akiva is channeling these legends. It is a dream, a fantasy. In a dream sequence Akiva is definitely channeling something on it for real, in having Nash have this insight in the bar. Although we very carefully back it up by showing his laborious pain working in his room, as winter turns to spring, to make it clear that he didn't just do it in one night."

As David Bayer says, there seems to be only a very loose connection between what is happening in the bar scene and the mathematical ideas that it supposedly inspires. Certainly, fighting for the blonde will likely be a fairly noncooperative game, and trying to figure out what the optimal strategy is seems to be the right approach in this context. However, a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily equivalent to an "optimal strategy" in the sense that John uses it in this scene. Furthermore, it seems impossible to interpret this scene as a noncooperative game having John's solutions as Nash equilibria. Bayer is not so bothered by this, but our feelings are mixed: the bar scene is cinematically a great scene, but we find the mathematical inaccuracy distracting.

##### **Back to the Pentagon Story**

BAYER: "In any case pretty soon after this we are shooting the Pentagon scene, and there are these latitudes and longitudes along the US-Canadian border. Now, Akiva was basically writing nonstop, writing in the middle of the night, rewriting even though the script was nominally finished before they started. And Russell always had new ideas, and Ron always had new ideas. And the usual tension, we don't want the writer on the set because the director wants to maintain control, goes out the window.

"Akiva and Ron had a great working relationship, particularly with Russell. And what it meant was that Akiva would be on the set helping the director and then, instead of sleeping he was doing rewrites [ _so that_ ] by the end of the movie it looked like he's had no sleep for three months. But I was asking him: 'Look, I have been helping Art [ _the art department_ ]. We are gonna eventually need to know these names of towns on the US-Canadian border.' And he is looking at me like tired: 'Dave, don't worry about it.'

"And I gradually get drawn into it, where basically I was sick of this entire scene, where he said 'Dave could you look for towns on the US-Canadian border?' I had some GPS software on my computer and I could basically scroll along the entire border and pick out interesting names, like Starky Corner. And they ended up in the script, complete with coordinates.

"You may not think this is math, but it is math in a way. It is numbers, math is numbers in a movie. If _Drowning by Numbers_ is math this is math, right? Basically Russell got used to the idea that a lot of movies just make stuff up. And at some point, Akiva is still building trust with Russell, he is like looking at Akiva like, 'There are some funny names in this script: does Starky Corner's name really exist, or is this bullshit?' And so Akiva comes to me like, 'Dave, Starky Corner.' He tells me what Russell said. 'Okay, Akiva I've got one of these math books on Maine in the car. I can bring it out and show you.' 'Yeah, please go get it.' So basically we are proving to Russell that this place actually exists."

#### **2.5 Hand Double**

BAYER: "The hand double bit came about by accident. Russell, Ron, and Akiva were discussing various scenes in rehearsal, and they had scheduled me to come in to talk to them about the stuff that was going to go on the blackboard. Russell would be writing it and I would be writing it and they looked at each other and said—I guess this was far more planned than I had any idea—that they realized that someone is going to do the math. And wondering whether I could do it, and they just wanted to approach it a certain way.

"Our handwriting looked pretty similar and our hands look pretty similar. I ended having to wear false nails for three months, I hated that. The executive producer said if anything demonstrates my dedication to this project it is that. I just clipped my nails back too far and he wanted to have longer nails.

"So basically if you are the hand double you are the hand double for everything. Where I would go to wardrobe, I would go to makeup, throw the gun into the river, moving markers on the board. It was kind of a Tom Cruise fantasy to be on the set, although they were struck that I tended to do everything in two takes and that was it. They imagined that I would be more nervous. They don't realize how us mathematicians have strange ideas like, 'We should have been Tom Cruise but for some genetic quirk,' and this is just our fate. It's not a big deal, it's nothing to be nervous about. Anyway that whole part was a lot of fun."

#### **2.6 Bits and Pieces**

##### **_αβ − βα_ →  **

**Question:** They get married and they are driving away in this car and on the rear window you can see the formula _αβ − βα → _. What was that all about?

BAYER: "Oh, I'm glad you are asking, I love that one. The script supervisor Eva Cabrera, it was not really her role to be asking this. But on the other hand, [ _given_ ] the kind of positive environment, she thought that there should be something drawn on the back of the window of the car in the wedding scene, and no one had thought about it.

"She mentioned it to Akiva and he said, 'Yeah, go ahead, ask Dave.' He thought we should obviously be writing some math on the window and so the math I came up with was to have a commutator approach zero, the idea that people would be more compatible. To mathematicians that would suggest increasing compatibility as this commutator would approach zero.

"I went through the whole script with Akiva and Ron in preproduction. And they wanted me to tell them everything that came to mind, even though they would take up only one suggestion out of ten. There are a lot of little things where Akiva and I were trying to write things together. And he would hear it, and both wanted me to believe the math sounded right, but also [ _they kept in mind_ ] how it would sound to a nonmathematical audience. Because sometimes it could have the opposite sound.

"Ron Howard and Akiva Goldman are very deliberate artists, very self-aware of what they are doing, and the fact is that they saw coming anything any critic could ever say. Making the movie was a deliberate artistic act, it brings in the money, it works, it makes people happy. So, in any way this is a perfect example of this, because zero has the wrong connotation. Akiva said, 'It can't be zero, but can there be a heart?' 'Yeah!' So it's very simple, we replace zero by a heart and everyone is happy."

##### **0 ≤ _π_ ≤ 1**

BAYER: "This is again about you never get to choose the one percent. Many, many production stills, in fact whenever you now see an image from the movie, almost always, even years later, involve some math that I did. One of the ones that got a lot of flack, at the time [ _was the one where_ ] Russell was looking through his dorm room window, and he is writing 0 ≤ _π_ ≤ 1.

"Again it is totally in character. I was immersing myself in John Nash's work and there is a paper he wrote on poker as a graduate student, in which he rather gleefully made sure that he needed exactly 24 symbols, and used all the Greek letters.

"If you can say that each letter has a certain lock on a certain meaning, my elitist mathematical view [ _laughs_ ] is that it is only swimmers at the shallow end of the pool who would ever draw the conclusion that _π_ has anything to do with the circle. The rest of us overload every symbol we can, and this is what Nash was doing. He was overloading the symbols: 0 ≤ _π_ ≤ 1. I was basically using papers from that era to decorate the dorm room, to try to be as realistic as possible, but in the end people jump to conclusions."

##### **Fly Versus Train**

1:53  
John discusses a very famous mathematical puzzle with his students.

_JOHN:... coming together at a maximum speed of, let us say, 10 miles per hour. So you have a fly on the tire of bicycle B, and the fly, who can travel at 20 miles an hour, leaves the tire of B and flies to the tire of bicycle A and backward and forward, until the two bikes collide and the poor little fly is squashed_.

_This is the important thing about actually focusing in, and comprehending the area you're dealing with. Mathematics is very specific, and it is an art form, no matter what people here will tell you, especially people from biology. Don't listen to those people. Let me go back to what you were doing, I might want to steal this, write a book and get famous_.

The information missing from John's description is how far the bicycles begin apart—let's just make up a number, say 1 mile—and the actual question to be answered: how far the fly will have traveled before it gets squashed?

Let's solve this problem, assuming both bicycles are traveling at 5 miles per hour. Since the fly is traveling at 20 miles per hour, its speed relative to bicycle _A_ is 25 miles per hour. So, leaving bicycle _B_ , the fly will reach bicycle _A_ in   of an hour, having traveled   of a mile. In the same period, each bicycle will have traveled   of a mile, leaving a distance of   of a mile between them.

Having reached bicycle _A_ , the fly then turns around, and heads back to _B_. To do this, the fly travels a further   of a mile, with the bicycles ending up   of a mile apart. Continuing in this way, the total distance traveled by the fly is given by the infinite geometric sum

By a standard trick, this sum can be calculated to be 2. So, we conclude that the fly travels two miles before it gets squashed.

There is actually a much simpler way to solve the problem. We only have to realize that it will take the bicycles one tenth of an hour before they collide. Therefore, the fly will have traveled   miles before this happens. To misdirect people from this simple solution, rather than specifying that the bicycles are coming together at a certain speed (here, 10 miles per hour), the problem is usually posed by stating that _A_ and _B_ are traveling at specific speeds, say 3 miles per hour and 7 miles per hour.

Here are two very famous stories about the brilliant mathematician John von Neumann. Von Neumann was one of the inventors of game theory, and it was one of his theorems that Nash generalized in his PhD thesis. Nash's advisor in the movie is modeled on von Neumann.

The first story goes that, when Nash shows von Neumann his proof of the existence of Nash equilibria, von Neumann is not at all impressed in the manner of the professor in the movie. Von Neumann supposedly more or less trivialized Nash's result, declaring it to be a simple fixed point theorem.

The second story is about a mathematical colleague posing the fly problem to von Neumann. Von Neumann comes up with the correct answer almost instantaneously. 'Interesting,' the impressed colleague is supposed to have remarked. 'Most people try to do the infinite sum.' 'What do you mean?' von Neumann replied. 'That's what I did.'

### **Chapter 3  
Escalante Stands and Delivers**

This is one of our favorites. _Stand and Deliver_ (1988) is the story of Jaime Escalante, a mathematics teacher from Bolivia who comes to Garfield High, a poor and poorly run school in the Latino area of East Los Angeles. He is a humorous, charismatic, and demanding teacher, who persuades his class to take the Advanced Placement exam in mathematics. The class performs so well that they are falsely accused of cheating by the testing authorities.

The story is substantially true, with important qualifications that we detail at the end of this chapter. The real-life Escalante was made famous by the events at Garfield High, which culminated in his winning the Presidential Medal for Excellence in Education in 1988 and being inducted into the National Teachers' Hall of Fame in 1999.

Sadly, Jaime Escalante died in 2010. Right up until his death, Escalante was actively involved in promoting mathematics, in sharing his passion for mathematics. _Stand and Deliver_ succeeds primarily because Edward James Olmos, who plays Escalante, captures this passion.

_Stand and Deliver_ is not a story about mathematics, nor even really a story about mathematics teaching; it is a story of the human spirit. Nonetheless, the movie contains lots of mathematics. Moreover, unlike the vast majority of school-based movies, the mathematics is not only internally correct, it is contextually correct: the mathematics the students fight with is what they would have had to fight with.

As the students progress, the mathematics progresses, from arithmetic and algebra to trigonometry and on to calculus. We won't comment on every piece of math that occurs, but certain scenes are notable, giving the flavor of Escalante's style and the role it plays in the drama. These scenes will be our guide to the movie.

#### **3.1 Welcome to the Finger Man**

When Escalante first appears, he is confronted by a wild and totally disinterested class: _I don't need no math. I got a solar calculator with my dozen donuts_. The class is then ended by a premature bell, but the next class sets the tone. Escalante appears wearing a butcher's apron and wielding a huge cleaver. Chopping apples, he illustrates fractions to the students. Two cholos, Chuco and Angel, appear late, and Escalante enters into a whispered discussion with Chuco:

0:10  
 _ESCALANTE: You know the times tables?  
CHUCO_ [sticking up his thumb]: _I know the ones_ [sticking up his second finger] _the twos_ [sticking up his middle finger, in an obscene gesture], _the threes...  
ESCALANTE: Finger Man. I heard about you. Are you the Finger Man? I'm the Finger Man too. You know what I can do?_ He holds his ten fingers splayed.] _I know how to multiply by 9. 9 times 3: 1, 2, 3_ [counting off with his fingers, to leave two fingers on one side of his crooked finger, and seven on the other side; see [figure 3.1]. _Whaddyou got?_ [wiggling his fingers] _27! 6 times 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Whaddyou got?_ [wiggling his fingers] _54! Yeah. Want a hard one? How about 8 times 9? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Whaddyou got?_ [wiggling his fingers] _72!_

Escalante has demonstrated a clever trick for multiplying by 9 (which works because the sum of the digits in the answer is equal to 9); the trick is cute in itself, but it also contains a message relevant to the drama to come.

#### **3.2 Filling the Hole**

In his next class Escalante explains zero, and negative numbers.

0:15  
 _ESCALANTE: You ever dig a hole? The sand that comes out of the hole, that's a positive. The hole is a negative. That's it. Simple. Anybody can do it. Minus two plus two—equals—_ [He cajoles Angel into answering]. _You going to let these burros laugh at you?  
ANGEL_ [sullenly] _: Zero.  
ESCALANTE: Zero. You're right. Simple. That's it! Minus two plus two equals zero. He just filled the hole. Did you know that neither the Greeks nor the Romans were capable of using the concept of zero? It was your ancestors, the Mayas, who first contemplated the zero, the absence of value. True story. You burros have math in your blood_.

**Fig. 3.1** Escalante demonstrates how to multiply by 9.

Escalante is substantially correct. The Mayans, unlike the Greeks and the Romans, had a certain conception of zero, of positional notation for numbers. For example, in the number 23 the 2 means "two tens," and in the number 203, the 2 means "two hundreds": it is the 0 which acts as a placeholder, keeping the distinction clear.

However, having 0 as a placeholder is not the same as understanding 0 to be a number in and of itself, as in the equation 2 − 2 = 0. The Mayans seemingly did not have this more subtle understanding of 0. Around 800 AD (and prior to the Mayans), a succession of Indian mathematicians struggled, ultimately successfully, with the more precise concept of 0 as a number.

**Fig. 3.2** Escalante hammers home the multiplication of negative numbers.

After his description of zero, Escalante goes on to discuss parentheses and negative numbers (figure 3.2):

_ESCALANTE: Oralé! Okay! Parentheses means multiply. Every time you see this, you multiply. A negative times a negative equals a positive. A negative times a negative equals a positive. Say it! A negative times a negative equals a positive. Say it!_

_CLASS AND ESCALANTE: A negative times a negative equals a positive_.

_ESCALANTE: Again!_

_CLASS AND ESCALANTE: A negative times a negative equals a positive. A negative times a negative equals a positive_.

_ESCALANTE: I can't hear you!_

_CLASS AND ESCALANTE: A negative times a negative equals a positive_.

_ESCALANTE: Louder!_

_CLASS AND ESCALANTE: A negative times a negative equals a positive_.

_ESCALANTE: Louder!_

_CLASS AND ESCALANTE: A negative times a negative equals a positive_.

_ESCALANTE_ [softly] _: Why?_

The above scene emphasizes two aspects of the teaching of mathematics: first, the drilling of the fact, until it is accepted as true without question; and second the question: _why_ is it true? (And the reader may well ponder, why indeed is a negative times a negative equal to a positive?)

#### **3.3 Let X Be the Number of Girlfriends**

The movie continues with a number of scenes of Escalante teaching algebra. The mathematics mostly appears as background illustration, including a great image of Angel as sinner (figure 3.3).

**Fig. 3.3** Angel being sacrificed on the Altar of Polynomials.

After the algebraic introductions, we see a problem discussed in detail.

0:32

_CLASS_ [reading from the blackboard] _: Juan has five times as many girlfriends as Pedro. Carlos has one girlfriend less than Pedro. The total number of girlfriends between them is twenty. How many does each gigolo have?_

_ESCALANTE: Anybody_. [Tito raises his hand.] _Think you got it, Einstein? You think you gonna do it?_

_TITO: Juan is X. Carlos is Y. Pedro is X plus Y. Is Pedro bisexual or what?_

_ESCALANTE: I have a terrible feeling about you_. [Tito blows Escalante a kiss.]  
 _CLAUDIA: Kemo. 5X equals Juan's girlfriends?_  
 _ESCALANTE: You're good now, but you're gonna end up barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitcheeen_. [Laughter from the class.]  
 _RAFAELA: Can you get negative girlfriends?_  
 _ESCALANTE: No, just negative boyfriends_. [He looks up to the heavens.] _Please forgive them, for they know not what they dooo!_  
 _ANGEL: Carlos has X minus_ 5 _girlfriends, que no?_  
 _ESCALANTE: Que no? is right. Que no_. [Lupe raises her hand.] _The answer to my prayers!_  
 _LUPE: May I go to the restroom please?_ [Laughter.]  
 _ESCALANTE: In ten minutes. Hold it_. [He walks up to Javier.] _Señor Maya. Hit it_.  
 _JAVIER_ [Javier smugly wiggling his pencil] _: It's a trick problem, Mr. Kemo. You can't solve it unless you know how many girlfriends they have in common. Right?_  
 _ESCALANTE: It's not that they're stupid. It's just that they don't know anything_.  
 _JAVIER: I'm wrong?_  
 _ANA_ [who has just appeared at the door] _: X equals Pedro's girlfriends_ , 5 _X equals Juan's girlfriends, X minus 1 equals Carlos's girlfriends. X plus_ 5 _X plus X minus 1 equals 20, so X equals 3_. [The class claps, as Ana sits down.]

Ana gives the expected answer, and the algebra is correct, but notice that Javier is also correct. Escalante is expecting the students to assume that no girl is the friend of more than one gigolo; as Javier has noticed, without this assumption, the problem has more than one solution.

#### **3.4 Newton Was an Idiot**

Escalante decides that he will prepare the class for the Advanced Placement mathematics exam (primarily calculus). The parents' permission is required for attendance at the extra classes, and we witness one student cajoling her mother.

0:41  
 _CLAUDIA: Mom, calculus is math that Sir Isaac Newton invented so he could figure out planet orbits, but he never bothered to tell anybody about his discovery until this other scientist guy went around claiming he had invented calculus. But the guy was so stupid that he got it all wrong, and so Newton had to go public and correct his mistakes. Don't you think that's neat? CLAUDIA'S MOM: For a genius, Newton was an idiot_.

Claudia is referring to Gottfried Willhelm Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus. Claudia's version of the history is correct, except for the implicit suggestion that Leibniz may not have come up with the ideas independently and the explicit claim that Leibniz was stupid and got it all wrong.

We next see the students, who have come to class very early in the morning. They are being taught a standard calculus technique for calculating volumes of revolution, "by disks." So the graph _y_ = _x_ 2 from _x_ = 0 to _x_ = 2 is rotated around the _y_ -axis, creating a bowl. The radius of the bowl at any height _y_ is then _x_ , giving the area _πx_ 2 of a horizontal circular slice through the bowl. This leads to Escalante's formula on the board (figure 3.4),

**Fig. 3.4** Escalante teaches volume by disks.

However, the students are struggling merely to stay awake:

0:44  
 _ESCALANTE: One, you got the graph, right here. Two, the strip, the most important part is right here. It's the radius of rotation. That's it. Anybody got any questions?_ [Escalante sees Tito, asleep, and Escalante starts slapping him gently with a towel.] _Wake up this morning! How are you?  
TITO_ [groggily] _: I was swimming with dolphins whispering imaginary numbers, looking for the fourth dimension.  
ESCALANTE_ [pushing Tito's head down onto the towel] _: Good! Go back to sleep. That's very good_.

In the next math scene, we see Pancho at the blackboard struggling, and failing, with an integration by parts problem (figure 3.5). He is attempting to compute the integral

_∫ x_ 2 sin _x_ d _x_ = _−x_ 2 cos _x_ \+ 2 _x_ sin _x_ \+ 2 cos _x_ \+ _C_.

Pancho's calculations are correct but unhelpful, since he has made the wrong choices for _u_ and d _v_ (using the usual symbols).

0:48  
 _ESCALANTE: Try the shortcut. This is easy. Baby stuff for boy scouts.  
PANCHO: Kemo, my mind don't work this way!  
ESCALANTE: Tic-tac-toe! It's a piece of cake upside down. Watch for the green light_. [Pancho stares at the board, and then thumps it with his fist.]

**Fig. 3.5** Tito struggles with integration by parts.

_PANCHO: I've been with you guys two years! Everybody knows I'm the dumbest. I can't handle calculus!_  
 _ESCALANTE: Do you have the ganas? Do you have the desire?  
PANCHO: Yes! I have the ganas!_  
 _ESCALANTE: You want me to do it for you!_  
 _PANCHO: Yes!_  
 _ESCALANTE: You're supposed to say "no"!_ [Escalante continues with the integration problem, and talks to Pancho as he writes.] _Tic. Tac. Toe. Simple_.

Escalante actually gives a very nice method for performing certain integration by parts problems, where the _u_ term, a power of _x_ , will be differentiated out (see figure 3.6): the first column contains _u_ and its derivatives, until we arrive at 0; the second column contains   = sin _x_ and its antiderivatives; and the third column contains alternating positives and negatives. Then, scoring off as indicated, he obtains all the terms produced by the integration.

Notice that by emphasizing his shortcut, Escalante also ignores Pancho's misunderstanding. As with the Finger Man trick for multiplication by 9, this is indicative of Escalante's style (in real life as well as in the movie): he places much more emphasis on drill and techniques than on fundamental understanding. The scene also uses Escalante's magic word: _ganas_. For Escalante, all that matters is _desire_. That is the message of the movie.

Escalante works himself into the ground, to the point of having a minor heart attack. We see this coming when Escalante asks the class about the function _f_ ( _x_ ) = 3sin(2 _x_ \+ _π_ ), but is unable to see what's going wrong (figure 3.7).

**Fig. 3.6** Escalante's shortcut.

0:52  
 _ESCALANTE: We're looking for the area in the first quadrant bounded by the curve. What are the limits? Anybody_.  
 _TITO: 0 to  sir_.  
 _ESCALANTE: Wrong. Lupe_.  
 _LUPE: 0 to_    
_ESCALANTE: What's wrong with you? This is review_.  
 _LUPE: Kemo, I checked my work twice_.  
 _ESCALANTE: I'm giving you the graph. Check it again_.  
 _ANGEL: No, Kemo, I'm getting the same answer as the gordita_.  
 _LUPE: Don't call me gordita, pendejo!_  
 _ANA: It's 0 to  sir_.  
 _JAVIER: Yeah. I got the same thing_.  
 _ESCALANTE: You should know this. No, no way. You should know this. What's wrong with you? This is review! You're acting like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that isn't there. What's wrong with you guys? I don't believe it. You're giving me a shot from the back! No way! No way!_

**Fig. 3.7** Escalante misleads the students.

The problem is that Escalante has misdrawn the graph: the function _f_ ( _x_ ) = 3sin(2 _x_ \+ _π_ ) equals 0 at _x_ = 0 and _x_ =   but the graph is _below_ the _x_ -axis (i.e., in the fourth quadrant) between these limits. Thus, in contradiction to Escalante's graph, the correct limits for the first region in the first quadrant are   to _π_.

Escalante's blind man description of the students is actually a famous quotation by Charles Darwin, describing _all_ mathematicians and the very nature of their pursuit. Escalante's use of it as a description of the students (supposedly) making simple mistakes is quite different.

#### **3.5 The Students Stand and Deliver, Again**

Finally, the students take the Advanced Placement exam. We see them struggle with the questions, and the relief afterward. But then comes the central drama of the movie, when the students are accused of cheating by the external authorities.

Reluctantly, the students retake the exam. In the climactic scene, we hear the students' scores being read out over the phone: they've all passed, and the movie ends with Escalante walking down the school corridor, pumping his fist in victory.

#### **3.6 Will the Real Jaime Escalante Please Stand Up?**

As we remarked above, the story of _Stand and Deliver_ is by and large true. The major fictional aspect of the movie was to compress many years of work, with many classes of students, into two years with one class.

Jaime Escalante started at Garfield High in 1974. The school already had an Advanced Placement math program, but it was in disrepair. In 1978 Escalante went to work on it. The first such class started with fourteen students; five students lasted to take the exam in 1979, of whom two students passed.

Each year, the size and the success of Escalante's program grew. _Stand and Deliver_ tells the story of the class of 1981–1982, when eighteen students took the exam. Fourteen of the students were (implicitly) accused of cheating; all those who were not accused passed the exam. The accused students were offered an alternate exam; two students declined, having already received university offers. The other twelve accused students sat the alternate exam, and all twelve passed. As the movie indicates at the very end, Escalante's program then continued to grow, becoming arguably the most successful such program in the country.

Although the compression of time leads to a dramatically powerful movie, it is also misleading in an important sense. The movie overstates how quickly Escalante could turn around the mathematics program, and how quickly he could take a student from mathematical ignorance to recognized success. This also goes some way to explaining why Escalante's classes continued to do better, year after year.

Another element of confusion in the story concerns Escalante's goal. Through teaching mathematics, Escalante attempted to make his students appreciate their own abilities and possibilities. The goal was not primarily to have the students understand and appreciate the mathematics; the goal was to pass the exam, which was the meaningful and practical achievement for the students. This part of the story is somewhat underemphasized in the movie.

The quick-trick approaches Escalante instilled would also tend to lead to the students making similar and peculiar mistakes, and goes part of the way to explain the suspicion triggered by the students' performance. However, there is another reason why the students' performance triggered suspicion: their performance was in fact suspicious. In reality it is not clear whether some of the students cheated or not (though by passing the test they proved that they didn't need to). This is discussed in some detail in Jay Matthews' excellent book; see footnote 2 on page 41.

Finally, there is one last manner in which the movie is misleading. In _Stand and Deliver_ , Escalante is presented as a strong-willed and somewhat acerbic character, but the movie gives no real sense of the extent to which Escalante was willing and able to really piss people off. In real life, Escalante did not suffer fools, and at Garfield High, Escalante's pushy, critical arrogance made him plenty of enemies. Effectively forced out, Escalante left Garfield High in 1991. The Advanced Placement program at Garfield then quickly crumbled.

But these are the most minor of quibbles. _Stand and Deliver_ is a wonderful movie about an incredible story, and a truly great teacher (figure 3.8).

### **Chapter 4  
The Annotated Pi Files**

Darren Aronosky's _π_ (1998) is an excellent, dark movie. Featuring a clever script, very good acting, and plenty of beautiful mathematics, this is a must-see cult movie, and a great source for mathematical movie clips.

The story is of the brilliant mathematician Max Cohen, played by Sean Gullette. Max is struggling to discern a pattern behind the numbers that make up the stock market. Along the way, he comes across some of mathematics' icons: _π_ , the Fibonacci numbers, and the golden ratio.

Max also gets mixed up with the numerology of Jewish mysticism. In fact, the answer to Max's question seems to be hidden in a 216-digit number that his new religious friend believes to be the name of God. The number seems to be the key to everything, with the power to wreak havoc: Max's computer Euclid repeatedly crashes while analyzing patterns that supposedly conceal the number; Max suffers debilitating migraine attacks; and Sol Robeson, Max's former PhD advisor, suffers two strokes, the second leading to his death. Finally, Max resorts to drilling into his brain, to eradicate all traces of the number. (Well, we told you the movie was dark.)

Here we give an annotated version of the story, told through the mathematical scenes and screenshots.

#### **4.1 Max the Mathematician**

0:02  
This scene introduces Max as someone who is brilliant with numbers. As Max leaves his apartment, the excited young Jenna runs up to him.

_JENNA: Max! Max! Can we do it?_  
 _MAX: Jenna_.  
 _JENNA: Three hundred and twenty-two times four hundred and eighty-one_. [Jenna types it into her pocket calculator.]  
 _MAX_ [instantly] _: One hundred fifty-eight thousand, one hundred two. Right?  
JENNA: Right!_

Actually there is a mistake here. Jenna should have said 322 × 491 instead of 322 × 481, according to the director's shooting script, and in order to get the answer in the movie.

Max heads down the staircase and Jenna screams after him.

_JENNA: Okay, seventy-three divided by twenty-two.  
MAX_ [instantly again] _: Three point three one eight one eight one eight..._

Here, Max's voice trails off as he walks down the stairs, "one" on one step and "eight" on the next. It is a poetic portrayal of the infinite decimal expansion of this number.

#### **4.2 Mathematics Is the Language of Nature**

0:03  
 _MAX_ [voiceover] _: Restate my assumptions:_

_1. Mathematics is the language of nature_.

_2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers_.

_3. If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge_.

_Therefore there are patterns everywhere in nature. Evidence: the cycling of disease epidemics, the wax and wane of Caribou populations, sunspot cycles, the rise and fall of the Nile. So what about the stock market? The universe of numbers that represents the global economy. Millions of human hands at work. Billions of minds, a vast network screaming with life, an organism, a natural organism. My hypothesis: Within the stock market there is a pattern as well, right in front of me, hiding behind the numbers. Always has been_.

This elegantly summarizes Max's approach to his research which, according to him, is number-theoretic in nature. Later, it degenerates into (what is in the real world) numerology.

Sixteen minutes into the commentary, director Darren Aronofsky remarks upon the math in the movie: "So, all this math stuff is real stuff. Fibonacci is a real dude or was a real dude and the golden spiral was real, we did not make it up for the film. It is just a lot of plagiarism from the Bible, from math text books, from Pythagoras, we kind of stuck it all together."

#### **4.3 Pattern in Pi**

0:10  
Max is playing Go with Sol, his former advisor.

_SOL: You haven't taken a single break_.  
 _MAX: I'm so close_.  
 _SOL: Have you met the new fish my niece bought me? I named her Icarus. After you, my renegade pupil. You fly too high, you'll get burned. The more I see you, the more I see myself thirty years ago. My greatest pupil published at sixteen, PhD at twenty. But life isn't just mathematics, Max. I spent forty years looking for patterns in π. I found nothing_.  
 _MAX: You found things_.  
 _SOL: I found things, but not a pattern_.

It is clear that by "pattern," Max and Sol mean some sort of pattern in the decimal expansion 3.1415... of _π_. In fact, investigation of the decimal expansion of _π_ is a comparatively meaningless endeavor for a top-notch mathematician.

There are _numbers_ and there are the different _ways of writing/representing numbers_ , and it is easy for nonmathematicians to confuse the two. The (base ten) decimal expansion of a number is a useful convention, but base ten is used simply because of the biological accident that (most) humans have ten fingers. However, writing a number in base ten seldom provides any special or deep insight into the number.

For example, at least theoretically we know whether or not a number is rational by looking at its full decimal expansion. A number is rational if (and only if) its decimal expansion winds up repeating forever, just like Jenna's   above. However, this is just as true if we expand the number with respect to any other base, such as base 2 or base 3.

As an illustration, _π_ is known to be an irrational number (although this was not discovered by examining its decimal expansion). So both its well known decimal expansion and its binary expansion

11.00100100001111110110101010001000...

go on forever, without repeating.

While it is important to realize that the decimal expansion of _π_ plays only a minor role in the study of this important number, it is equally important to realize that mathematics is not as dehumanized a subject as it is often portrayed. Entirely human motives and aesthetics are often responsible for the obsession of mathematicians with officially unimportant topics. The decimal expansion of _π_ is one such example, regularly providing challenges for new supercomputers. And some very good mathematicians spend considerable time puzzling over problems related to this fairly random choice of writing _π_ , as well as the more general question of writing _π_ with respect to other bases.

Given this general obsession with the decimal expansion of _π_ , it may come as a surprise that mathematicians know very little about the patterns of this most popular way of writing _π_. While it is simple to compute larger and larger portions of the decimal expansion of _π_ , we do not even know whether each of the different digits 0 to 9 occurs infinitely often. Still, there have been major advances in our understanding of these expansions. Perhaps the most remarkable is the discovery of a formula enabling us to calculate any desired digit in the binary expansion of _π_ , without having to calculate any of the preceding digits.

Finally, if Max is deeply concerned with the decimals of _π_ , Darren Aronofsky is clearly much less so. The background for the title sequence of the movie is thousands of digits of the decimal expansion of _π_ , but only the first nine digits are correct (figure 4.1). Looking closely at the sequence of numbers rolling across the screen, you notice giveaway strings such as 0123456789 popping up. It quickly becomes clear that someone simply made up most of the numbers. It's all a bit surprising: since it is incredibly easy to get hold of the correct decimal expansion of _π_ up to billions of decimal places, it seems it would be harder to get things wrong here than to get them right.

Other mathematical images in the title sequence of the movie are supposed to get us into Max's head during one of his migraine attacks (Möbius strips, spirals, 3D plots of functions, and so on.)

0:12  
Max sits in a New York City subway car.

_MAX_ [voiceover] _: Not a pattern—Sol died a little when he stopped research on π. It wasn't just a stroke. He stopped caring. How could he stop when he was so close to seeing π for what it really is? How could you stop believing that there is a pattern, an ordered shape behind those numbers when you are so close? We see the simplicity of the circle, we see the maddening complexity of the endless string of numbers, three point one four, off to infinity_.

While saying this, Max draws a circle and then writes the formulas _A_ = _πr_ 2 and _C_ = 2 _πr_. Next he writes _π_ = 3.14159...

By the way, _π_ is not the first movie in which a message from God (or similar) is encoded in numbers. In the unintentionally hilarious _Red Planet Mars_ (1952), scientists employ the decimal expansion of _π_ to communicate with the "Martians." Also, in his science fiction novel _Contact_ , Carl Sagan ponders the possibility of finding a message from the creators of the Universe embedded in the base eleven expansion of _π_. Sadly, this part of the story did not make it into the movie of the same title. Our consolation prize is Jodie Foster discussing prime numbers.

**Fig. 4.1** Part of the title sequence of the movie _π_.

#### **4.4 Numerology: Father + Mother = Child**

0:13  
While scribbling on paper in a cafe, Max meets Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew.

_LENNY: So, what do you do?_  
 _MAX: Um, I work with computers, math_.  
 _LENNY: Math? What type of math?_  
 _MAX: Number theory. Research, mostly_.  
 _LENNY: No way, I work with numbers myself. I mean not traditional, though I work with the Torah. Amazing. You know Hebrew is all math, it's all numbers. You know that? Here look. The ancient Jews used Hebrew as their numerical system. Each letter is a number. Like the Hebrew A, Aleph is one. B, Bet, is two, understand? Look at this. The numbers are interrelated. Like take the Hebrew word for father Ab, Aleph, Bet, one_ [plus] _two equals three, all right. Hebrew word for mother Am, Aleph, Mam, one_ [plus] _forty equals forty-one. Sum of three and forty-one, forty-four, right? Hebrew word for child, mother, father, child, (ye)(le)d, that's ten_ [plus] _thirty and four, forty-four_. _The Torah is just a long string of numbers. Some say that it is a code sent to us from God_.  
 _MAX: That's kind of interesting_.  
 _LENNY: Yeah, that's just kids' stuff. Check this out. The word for the Garden of Eden, Kadem. Numerical translation one forty-four_.

At this point, Lenny scribbles the numbers 4, 30, and 10, which do _not_ sum to 144. Referring to the shooting script, we find that the intended numbers are Kuf = 100, Daled = 4, and Mem = 40. Of course, what all this also demonstrates is that the type of nonsense behind The Bible Code is not at all new.

_LENNY: Now the value of Tree of Knowledge in the garden, right, Aat Ha Haim, two hundred thirty-three. One forty-four, two thirty-three. Now you can take those numbers_.

#### **4.5 The Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Ratio**

_MAX: Those are Fibonacci numbers_.  
 _LENNY: Huh?_  
 _MAX: You know, the Fibonacci sequence_.  
 _LENNY: Fibonacci?_  
 _MAX: Fibonacci is an Italian mathematician in the thirteenth century_.

Here, Max begins writing out the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,... Remember that in the Fibonacci sequence a new number is obtained by adding the two preceding numbers: 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, and so on. This means that the sequence continues as

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,...

So 144 and 233 are really Fibonacci numbers, as Max spotted straight away.

_MAX: If you divide a hundred and forty-four into two hundred and thirty-three, the result approaches theta_.  
 _LENNY: Theta?_  
 _MAX: Theta, the Greek symbol for the golden ratio, the golden spiral_.

Time to recall some basic facts about the golden ratio _θ_ (theta), or _φ_ (phi), as it is now more commonly called. A rectangle is _golden_ if, on cutting away a square as pictured in figure 4.2, we are left with a new, rotated rectangle of the same shape. Then the golden ratio is the ratio of the long to the short side of a golden rectangle.

**Fig. 4.2** Removal of a square from a golden rectangle leaves a smaller golden rectangle.

Using this geometric definition it is easy to calculate that

As Max indicates, the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio are closely related. Max mentions one of the most beautiful links, first discovered by Johannes Kepler (of planetary fame): If _F n_ denotes the _n_ th Fibonacci number, then the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers   approaches the golden ratio as _n_ goes to infinity:

In fact, this way of approximating the golden ratio gives very good results even for small _n_. For example,   approximates the golden ratio correctly to four decimal places.

The golden ratio and the Fibonacci numbers appear in many natural phenomena, which is why Max is so interested in them.

_MAX: Theta, the Greek symbol for the golden ratio, the golden spiral_.

Max draws what is probably supposed to be a _logarithmic spiral_ : this is a special spiral with the property that the ratio of two successive radii does not depend upon the direction. This fixed ratio, which can be any positive number, determines the precise proportions of the spiral. Logarithmic spirals approximate many naturally occurring spirals, such as the one apparent in the cross section of a nautilus shell (figure 4.3).

**Fig. 4.3** A logarithmic spiral in a nautilus shell, with two consecutive radii highlighted.

_LENNY: Wow, I never saw that before. That's like that series that you find in nature, like the face of a sunflower?_  
 _MAX: Wherever there's spirals_.

Here, Max ponders a spiral created by dropping a dollop of cream into his coffee.

_LENNY: See, there's math everywhere_.

What do spirals, and, in particular, logarithmic spirals have to do with the golden ratio and the Fibonacci numbers? A bit, but not as much as Max suggests, or nearly as much as is commonly believed.

A first and very striking link, with which Lenny seems to be familiar, relates to the roughly logarithmic spirals visible in many flower heads: count the numbers of left-winding and right-winding spirals, and you usually get two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. In sunflowers these two numbers are, depending on the size of the flower head, 21 and 34, 34 and 55, 55 and 89, or 89 and 144. The presence of these Fibonacci numbers can be explained in terms of mathematical properties of the golden ratio.

There are many other genuine occurrences of these numbers in nature. Regrettably, Max picks one of the weakest examples as one of his guiding principles: the commonly touted links between many of the logarithmic spirals occurring in nature and the golden ratio are mostly the product of wishful thinking and screwy logic.

True, there is indeed a natural logarithmic spiral associated with the golden ratio, and Max actually constructs it later on in the movie. Rather than wait for Max, let's have a closer look now.

**Fig. 4.4** Constructing a spiral from a golden rectangle.

Cut away a square from a golden rectangle, as in the second diagram of figure 4.4. Then you are left with a new, smaller, golden rectangle. Cut a second square from this new golden rectangle and you get another even smaller golden rectangle. Repeating, and highlighting the squares that are cut off, we obtain the third diagram above. Next, inscribe a quarter circle in each of the squares, as in the fourth diagram, and the result is a spiral.

Now, it is often claimed that this spiral is logarithmic. This is clearly nonsense, since logarithmic spirals don't contain circle segments. However, there is a specific logarithmic spiral that contains all the indicated (infinitely many) corners of the squares. And this logarithmic spiral does look very similar to the spiral composed of quarter circles.

Okay, so there is a logarithmic spiral associated with the golden ratio in a fairly natural manner. Its determining ratio of consecutive radii is _φ_ 4 = 6.854... However, as we remarked above, _every_ positive real number has an associated logarithmic spiral, and all these spirals are different in shape.

Therefore, it makes no sense to claim, as is so often done, that every logarithmic spiral we find in nature must automatically be the spiral associated with the golden ratio. For example, in the cross section of a nautilus shell, we can see a spiral which is definitely close to being logarithmic. However, contrary to common belief this spiral is usually not even close to the golden ratio spiral.

Later in this chapter, and also in chapter 5 ("Nitpicking in Mathmagic Land"), we will continue our discussion of true and imagined properties of the golden ratio and the Fibonacci numbers. For a list of other movies that feature these numbers see section 21.7.

Back to the story.

 _MAX_ [voiceover] _: Restate my assumptions:_

_1. Mathematics is the language of nature_.

_2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers_.

_3. If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge. Therefore there_ are _patterns everywhere in nature_.

As Max says this, he draws a square spiral whose vertices seem to coincide with certain entries of the stock market charts he is studying; see figure 4.5.

**Fig. 4.5** "if you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge."

_MAX_ [voiceover] _: So what about the stock market? The universe of numbers that represents the global economy. Millions of human hands at work. Billions of minds, a vast network screaming with life, an organism, a natural organism. My hypothesis: Within the stock market there is a pattern, right in front of me, playing with the numbers. Always has been_.

Clearly, Max believes he has had a major insight. Following up on this he runs a program on Euclid, his computer, to predict the stock market. The results seem absurd, and Euclid crashes. However, before it crashes Euclid prints out a long string of seemingly random numbers. At the same time Max passes out from one of his migraines.

#### **4.6 Archimedes the Goldfish**

0:20  
Sol's apartment. Max and Sol are playing Go.

_MAX: Euclid crashed. I lost all my data, my hardware_.  
 _SOL: Your mainframe?_  
 _MAX: Burnt_.  
 _SOL: What happened?_  
 _MAX: First I get these crazy low picks. Then Euclid spits out this long string of numbers. Never saw anything like it and then it fries. The whole machine just crashed_.  
 _SOL: You have a printout?_  
 _MAX: Of what?_  
 _SOL: Of the picks, the number?_  
 _MAX: I threw it out_.  
 _SOL: What was the number it spit out?_  
 _MAX: I don't know, just a long string of digits_.  
 _SOL: How many?_  
 _MAX: I don't know_.  
 _SOL: What was it, a hundred, a thousand, two hundred sixteen_ [this is important!] _How many?_  
 _MAX: I don't know. Probably around two hundred. Why?_  
 _SOL: I dealt with some bugs back in my π days. I was wondering if it was similar to one I ran into. Have you met Archimedes_ [one of his fish] _? The one with the black spots. You see?_  
 _MAX: Yeah_.  
 _SOL: You remember Archimedes of Syracuse? The King asks Archimedes to determine if a present he's received is actually solid gold. Unsolved problem at the time. It tortures the great Greek mathematician for weeks. Insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns in his bed for nights on end. Finally, his equally exhausted wife, she's forced to share a bed with this genius, convinces him to take a bath, to relax. While he is entering the tub Archimedes notices the bathwater rise. Displacement. A way to determine volume. And thus, a way to determine density, weight over volume. And thus, Archimedes solves the problem. He screams "Eureka!" and is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the King's palace to report his discovery. Now, what is the moral of the story?_  
 _MAX: That a breakthrough will come_.  
 _SOL: Wrong. The point of the story is the wife. You listen to your wife, she will give you perspective. Meaning, you need a break, you have to take a bath, or you'll get nowhere. There will be no order, only chaos. Go home, Max, and you take a bath_.

The credits of the movie include consultants for Go, Judaica, and medicine, but none for mathematics. From Aronofsky's commentary we know that his father is a scientist. The story about Archimedes in the movie was told to the director by his father. In his commentary, the actor Sean Gullette remarks that all the math material that we see in the movie was compiled by the director.

Sol telling the story of Archimedes and the gold crown is one of the best movie clips about Archimedes. For other appearances of Archimedes, see chapter 20.

#### **4.7 Coincidence, or Is It?**

In a synagogue.

_LENNY: You know when you told me that you were Max Cohen, I didn't realize that you were the Max Cohen. Your work is revolutionary, you know that. It's inspired the work that we do_.  
 _MAX: It has?_  
 _LENNY: Yes, very much so. The only difference is, we're not looking at the stock market. We're searching for a pattern in the Torah_.  
 _MAX: What kind of pattern?_  
 _LENNY: We're not sure. We only know, it's 216 digits long_.

0:28  
Back in Sol's apartment.

_MAX: What's the two hundred and sixteen number, Sol?_  
 _SOL: Excuse me?_  
 _MAX: You asked me if I had seen a two hundred and sixteen digit number, right?_  
 _SOL: Oh, you mean the bug. I ran into it working on π_.  
 _MAX: What do you mean "ran into it"?_  
 _SOL: What is this all about?_  
 _MAX: There's these religious Jews that I've been talking to_.  
 _SOL: Religious Jews?_  
 _MAX: Yeah, you know Hasids, the guys with the beards. I met one in the coffee shop. It turns out the guy's a number theorist. The Torah is his data set. He tells me that they are looking for a two hundred and sixteen digit number in the Torah_.  
 _SOL: Come on, it's just a coincidence_.  
 _MAX: There's something else, though_.  
 _SOL: What?_  
 _MAX: You remember those weird stock picks I got_.  
 _SOL: Yesterday's stock picks, yes?_  
 _MAX: It turns out they were correct. I got two picks on the nose. Smack on the nose Sol. Something's going on. It has to do with that number. There is an answer in that number_.  
 _SOL: Come with me_.

Sol and Max are playing Go again.

_SOL: The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the Universe. Although, when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe and that's the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern. MAX: But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable.  
SOL: So, so?_  
 _MAX: So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is a pattern, an order, underlying every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the stock market, the Torah. This two sixteen number.  
SOL: This is insanity, Max_.  
 _MAX: Or maybe it's genius. I have to get that number_.  
 _SOL: Hold on, you have to slow down. You're losing it, you have to take a breath. Listen to yourself. You're connecting a computer bug I had, with a computer bug you might have had, and some religious hogwash. If you want to find the number two sixteen in the world, you'll be able to find it everywhere. Two hundred sixteen steps from your street corner to your front door. Two hundred sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator. When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, you will filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere. Three hundred and twenty, four hundred and fifty, twenty-three. Whatever! You've chosen two hundred sixteen and you'll find it everywhere in nature. But Max, as soon as you discard scientific rigor, you are no longer a mathematician. You are a numerologist_.

Great speech by Sol here: if only Max had listened! Who has not noticed a certain number, and then seen this number appear again and again? Of course, on closer inspection most of these "unlikely" events will be found to be quite likely. For example, in a room with 23 or more people, there is a greater than 50:50 chance that two of the people will share a birthday. It feels wrong, until you do the simple math.

#### **4.8 Back to the Golden Ratio**

0:41  
In his apartment, after Max has been pondering yet more spirals.

_MAX: Remember Pythagoras. Mathematician, cult leader, Athens, circa 500 BCE. Major belief: The Universe is made of numbers. Major contribution: The golden ratio. Best represented geometrically as the golden rectangle. Visually there exists a graceful equilibrium between the shape's length and width. When it is squared, it leaves a smaller golden rectangle behind, with the same unique ratio. The squaring can continue smaller and smaller and smaller, to infinity_.

As Max says this, he draws the golden spiral as we described it earlier; compare figures 4.4 and 4.6.

**Fig. 4.6** Max superimposes the golden spiral on DaVinci's _Vitruvian Man_.

Max makes a number of mistakes here. First, crediting Pythagoras with the discovery of the golden ratio is suspect; see chapter 5 ("Nitpicking in Mathmagic Land") for details. Second, he reiterates the popular myth that golden rectangles are aesthetically ("perfectly") proportioned. In fact, there is _no_ reliable evidence that winners of Rectangle Beauty Contests have close-to-golden proportions. The reason that Leonardo DaVinci's drawing shows up here is because it is supposed to feature perfect golden proportions, which is not the case. We'll have much more to say about this in chapter 5. Third, using the expression "squaring" to mean "removing a square" is peculiar. Finally, and most importantly, the comparison of ratios should actually be written

_A_ : _B_ :: _A_ \+ _B_ : _A_.

For all our criticism, Max gets it substantially correct (not only in terms of the spiral).

0:42  
 _MAX_ [voiceover] _: More evidence: Remember DaVinci, artist, inventor, sculptor, naturalist, scientist, Italy fifteenth century, rediscovered the balanced perfection of the golden rectangle and penciled it into his masterpieces. Connecting a curve through the concentric golden rectangles, you generate the mythical golden spiral. Pythagoras loved this shape, for he found it everywhere in nature: the nautilus shell, rams horns, whirlpools, tornados, our fingerprints, our DNA, and even our Milky Way_.

The word "concentric" makes no sense in this context. Indeed, all that Max says here is basically nonsense.

#### **4.9 Staring into the Sun**

0:43  
Walking around in Chinatown.

_MAX_ [voiceover] _: When I was a little kid my mom told me not to stare into the sun. So, once when I was six I did. At first the brightness was overwhelming but I had seen that before. I kept looking, forcing myself not to blink and then the brightness began to dissolve. My pupils shrank to pinholes and everything came into focus and for a moment I understood. My new hypothesis: If we are built from spirals, living in a giant spiral, then everything we put our hands to is infused with the spiral_.

This is reminiscent of the famous story about the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau. Plateau, master of soap films, is well known among mathematicians and bubbleologists for what are now known as Plateau's Problem and Plateau's Rules. Plateau is also famous for being stupid enough to perform Max's exact experiment and find out what happened if he stared at the Sun. And he indeed found out: Plateau went blind.

Max makes a deal with some stock market analysts who want to get their hands on his results on predicting the stock market. This gets him a new powerful computer chip. He also offers to help Lenny to find the number and gets the Torah on a disk from him. Max starts analyzing the Torah with his fixed and chip-enhanced computer Euclid. Euclid crashes, and so does Max (another violent migraine).

Euclid's monitor is filled again with the mysterious string of numbers that Max encountered previously. This time we get a complete view:

829519475412398501.

On closer inspection, it turns out that there are actually 218 digits and not 216 as we were led to believe earlier. As usual in the movie business, near enough is good enough.

Sol's apartment.

_MAX: You lied to me_.  
 _SOL: Okay, sit down. I gave up before I pinpointed it. But my guess is that certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a particular loop. The loop leads to meltdown, but just before they crash they—they become "aware" of their own structure. The computer has a sense of its own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients_.  
 _MAX: The computer becomes conscious?_  
 _SOL: In some ways—I guess_.  
 _MAX_ [to himself] _: Studying the pattern made Euclid conscious of itself. Before it died it spit out the number. That consciousness is the number_.  
 _SOL: No, Max, it's only a nasty bug_.  
 _MAX: It's more than that!_  
 _SOL: No it's not! It's a dead end, there is nothing there_.  
 _MAX: It's a door Sol, a door_.  
 _SOL: A door in front of a cliff. You're driving yourself over the edge. You need to stop_.  
 _MAX: You were afraid of it. That's why you quit_.  
 _SOL: Max, I got burnt_.  
 _MAX: C'mon, Sol_.  
 _SOL: It caused my stroke_.  
 _MAX: That's bullshit. It's mathematics, numbers, ideas. Mathematicians are supposed to be out on the edge. You taught me that!_  
 _SOL: Max, there's more than math! It's death, Max!_  
 _MAX: You can't tell me what it is. You've retreated to your Go and your books and your goldfish, but you're not satisfied_.  
 _SOL: Max go home. Get out of my house_.  
 _MAX: I'm going to know what it is, I'm going to see it, I'm going to understand it_.

#### **4.10 The Name of God**

1:07  
Synagogue. A rabbi tells Max why the number is important for them.

_MAX_ [incredulous] _: You're telling me that the number in my head is the true name of God!?_  
 _RABBI: It's more than God—it's everything. It's math and science and nature—the Universe. I saw the Universe's DNA_.  
 _MAX: It's just a number. I'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen number. You've translated all of them. You've intoned them all. Haven't you? But what's it gotten you?_ _The number is nothing! It's the meaning, the syntax. It's what's between the numbers. If you have not understood it, it's not for you. I've got it, I've got it and I understand it, I'm going to see it! Rabbi—I was chosen_.

The 216-digit number being the name of God refers to _Schemhamphoras_ , or the _Divided Name of God_. It is hidden in the book of Exodus, chapter 14, verses 19, 20, and 21. Each verse is composed of seventy-two letters (in the original Hebrew). Writing these three verses one above the other, the first from right to left, the second from left to right, and the third from right to left, one gets seventy-two columns of three-letter names of God.

So, contrary to what is said in the movie, this 216-letter name is actually well known. Also, this 216-letter name does not translate into 216 decimals. However, there seems to be (at least) one real secret associated with this 216 letter name; nobody knows how it should be pronounced, and this is apparently essential if you want to tap into its power.

1:11  
Sol has died after a second stroke. In Sol's apartment, Max finds a piece of paper on which is written the 216 digit number. Max slides it into his pocket and notices that the pieces on the Go board are arranged in a giant spiral.

#### **4.11 Living Happily Ever After**

1:15  
Max burns the sheet of paper with the number, then drills into the "math section" of his head with a power drill. Afterward, Max can no longer perform the lightning calculations with the little girl Jenna, but he is not bothered. For the first time, we see Max smile. End of a great story.

The ending is summed up perfectly in the director's commentary:

1:16  
 _I always wanted to end the film with little Jenna saying: What's the answer? And having Max not able to give the answer because for the first time he doesn't have the answer. And, in many ways I think that's what π is about. It's about the questions, it's about the chaos, it's about the search for order. That's where Max finds beauty, he finds it now, he finds it in the world around him_.

### **Chapter 5  
Nitpicking in Mathmagic Land**

In _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ (1959), we accompany Donald Duck (played by himself) as the True Spirit of Adventure introduces him to the wonders of mathematics. This gem of a movie is to mathematics what Disney's _Fantasia_ is to classical music. _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ is half documentary, half duck action movie.

For decades, _Mathmagic Land_ has been an invaluable asset for teachers seeking to inspire their students. However, much of Donald's math is unclear, and some is incorrect. Our intention in this chapter is to sort out what is really going on. We hope it will prove a helpful resource for teachers, and parents, with budding mathematicians to inspire.

Most of the mathematics presented is similar to that in other introductions to the beautiful side of mathematics: the golden section (or golden ratio), the Pythagorean theory of music, conic sections, infinity, and so on. One notable exception is the _diamond rule_ , a mathematical rule of thumb for playing three-cushion billiards.

In the following, we'll spend less time on the obvious parts of the movie, with which most readers of this book are probably familiar. Instead, we'll focus upon aspects that are easily overlooked, and we'll do some nitpicking of mathematical claims that are not quite right (or just plain wrong). In particular, we'll draw attention to some of the popular myths about the golden section, and we'll try to make better sense of the diamond rule than is done in the movie.

#### **5.1 Tiny Nitpick: What Is Pi?**

Mathmagic Land is populated by plants with number-shaped branches and leaves, trees with square roots (!), and other intriguing mathematical creatures. Particularly memorable are the pencil and pi creatures. The pencil creature has a pencil head and a right-triangled body. It writes random digits on the ground and challenges Donald to a game of tic-tac-toe (which of course the pencil creature wins).

The pi creature recites " _π_ is equal to 3.14159265389747 etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." Surprisingly, he goofs the last two digits: in fact, the decimal expansion of _π_ begins 3.141592653589793... However, the pi creature can at least take comfort in the fact that most other movies featuring a chunk of the decimal expansion of _π_ do even worse; see chapter 18 ("Money-Back Bloopers").

#### **5.2 Historical Nitpick: Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans**

To convince Donald that mathematics is "not just for eggheads," the Spirit whisks Donald off to ancient Greece to meet "Pythagoras, the master egghead of them all." The background for the first scene is the painting shown in figure 5.1.

**Fig. 5.1** The Pythagoreans: the theorem, some music, and their pentagram logo.

Time for some math spotting! The pentagram at the top was the logo of the Pythagoreans. Underneath, we see what is clearly supposed to be the name "Pythagoras" written in Greek, but there are mistakes: it should be spelled Π _νθαγ_ ó _ραζ_. Then comes the famous diagram that accompanies the first proof of Pythagoras's theorem in Euclid's _Elements_.

This raises an important historical point: while watching the charming Pythagoras, one should keep in mind the uncertainty as to which of "his" discoveries should rather be attributed anonymously to the Pythagorean cult, and which have nothing to do with the Pythagoreans whatsoever. As a telling example, Pythagoras's theorem probably belongs in the latter category

#### **5.3 Small Nitpick: Pythagorean Music**

In the painting we also see a number of musical instruments and, in the scenes that follow, the Pythagorean contribution to music theory is sketched. Donald is very impressed that mathematics can be found in music and we witness a musical jam session, with Donald on bongos and Pythagoras on lyre. Then Donald is initiated into the Pythagorean society: Pythagoras stamps a regular pentagram onto Donald's palm.

All great fun! However, this fun also disguises some clumsiness and confusion:

_SPIRIT: Pythagoras discovered the octave had a ratio of two to one. With simple fractions he got this_ [a chord is played upon the lyre]. _And from this harmony in numbers developed the musical scale of today_.

**Fig. 5.2** Donald demonstrating the Pythagorean theory of music.

In figure 5.2 we've highlighted the numbers, indicating the string ratios, to which the Spirit refers; the shortest string is half the longest, creating the octave interval. It does not really make sense to say Pythagoras "discovered" that the octave has this ratio, since the octave is simply defined in this manner; it is (perhaps) more accurate to say that Pythagoras discovered that the ratio of two to one sounds harmonious.

As well, the Pythagorean system of music was not nearly as simple or as obvious as the Spirit suggests. In fact, there are many plausible choices for the system of string lengths, and it was later mathematicians and musicians who placed greater emphasis on the use of simple fractions, an approach that is referred to as _just intonation_. In particular, the Pythagorean system did not use the ratio 8:5, but rather the much less obvious choice of 128:81.

#### **5.4 Medium Nitpick: The Golden Section**

The Spirit shows Donald how the golden section arises from the pentagram on Donald's palm; see figure 5.3. Then the Spirit dazzles Donald with some of the most famous of the amazing mathematical properties of the golden section and its omnipresence in nature. Sadly, the Spirit also repeats many of the common but silly myths about the golden section, having to do with the alleged use of the golden section as a major mathematical "law of beauty" in art, in particular in painting and architecture. Almost everything shown and said for two minutes from the nine minute mark is nonsense:

**Fig. 5.3** The golden section equals the ratio of a diagonal of the pentagon to a side.

_SPIRIT: To the Greeks, the golden section represented a mathematical law of beauty. We find it in their classical architecture. The Parthenon one of the most famous Greek buildings contains many golden rectangles_.

In the movie, and whenever such claims are made, the only evidence provided is a golden rectangle or two superimposed onto the object in question. Figure 5.4 is a very famous example involving the Parthenon. At first glance this may appear quite convincing, but on closer inspection it is clear that other rectangles could have been equally well chosen. For example, there is no particular reason why the bottom of the superimposed rectangle should end where it does, rather than at the bottom of the columns or the bottom of the stairs.

**Fig. 5.4** The Parthenon exhibiting perfect proportions.

_SPIRIT: The same golden proportions are also used in their sculpture. In the centuries that followed, the golden section dominated the idea of beauty in architecture throughout the western world. The cathedral of Notre Dame is an outstanding example_.

Although the golden section arose in the geometry of the ancient Greeks, there is no concrete evidence of its application in art or architecture prior to Luca Pacioli's linking of the golden section to aesthetics in the early sixteenth century. Even then, the earliest definite application of the golden section in art was not until the ninteenth century.

_SPIRIT: The Renaissance painters knew this secret well_.

Here we are shown Leonardo da Vinci's _Mona Lisa_ , cluttered with superimposed rectangles. Leonardo was certainly aware of the golden section and even acted as illustrator for Luca Pacioli. However, it is highly questionable whether Leonardo used it in his own creations. If so, he never bothered to mention it in any of his writings.

_SPIRIT: Today, the golden rectangle is very much a part of our modern world_.

At this point we are shown the facade of the United Nations headquarters, divided up by three supposedly golden rectangles. However, measurements of these rectangles show that they are not close to golden.

_SPIRIT: Modern painters have rediscovered the magic of these proportions_.

A few have, such as Salvadore Dali: most haven't. Our discussions with architects and artists suggest that they tend to care about the golden section to the exact extent of feeling confused and guilty. And we strongly suspect that those few who now employ the golden section do so with no clear aesthetic purpose and merely from the mistaken belief that they're following a classical tradition. That is, the supposed aesthetic beauty of the golden section has become a self-perpetuating myth.

_SPIRIT: Indeed, this ideal proportion is to be found in nature itself_.

Here, we are shown a beautifully proportioned ballerina, with several golden rectangles chopping up her body. Again, it is no more than wishful thinking that golden section proportions are the key to beauty in the human body.

By the end of this golden section marathon, Donald is inspired to demonstrate that his body, too, has perfect proportions. He succeeds, by jamming himself into a regular pentagon (see figure 5.5), and the Spirit laughs at Donald.

**Fig. 5.5** Donald exhibiting perfect proportions.

The Spirit might have kept his laughter in check if he had listened to the speech on numerology in the movie _π_ (see section 4.7). Then the Spirit could have realized that squeezing the Parthenon into a golden rectangle is no different from Donald's contortionist exercise. A step further, and the Spirit could have realized that with sufficient work and by turning a blind eye or two, one can find the golden section, or any number desired, pretty much anywhere.

This interesting but very misleading section is followed by an impressive slideshow of natural shapes that, for the most part, really _are_ based upon the golden section: pentagonal flower heads, branching patterns, seed heads, pinecones, and so on. Alas, the Spirit then repeats the enticing but groundless myth that the spirals of nautilus shells are related to the golden ratio.

#### **5.5 Large Nitpick: Three-Cushion Billiards**

The Spirit points out that mathematics is found in many games. First, chess: Donald turns into Lewis Carrol's Alice and makes a narrow escape. Then, baseball, football, basketball, and hopscotch. All of these examples are rather weak. For example, hopscotch is apparently mathematical because of its "multiple squares." But, finally, we have:

_SPIRIT: A mathematical game played on a field of two perfect squares, using three perfect spheres, and a lot of diamonds. In other words, billiards_.

It is clear that Donald is being guided by an American Spirit, and that by "billiards" he means three-cushion billiards, rather than the more common English billiards. Both games use three balls, but a three-cushion billiard table has no pockets. In three-cushion billiards, the aim is to make the cue ball hit the other two balls, with the cue ball contacting at least three rails (or cushions) before it hits the second target ball.

The diamonds divide the long side of the table into eight equal intervals and the short side into four. We'll explain how an expert player uses the diamonds to plan a typical shot, such as that shown in figure 5.6. To simplify the following discussion, we'll just consider two balls, with the white ball the cue ball and the black ball the target ball.

**Fig. 5.6** Making a three-cushion shot.

Figure 5.7 shows one of the billiard shots discussed in the movie. Here, _A_ marks a point on the left rail, the imaginary point where the cue ball began. Then _B_ and _C_ mark the points at which the cue ball bounces off the two long rails.

**Fig. 5.7** The diamond rule _A − B_ = _C_ : here, _A_ = 4, _B_ = 1, and _C_ = 3.

The diamonds on the left side of the table are numbered in two ways, first for point _A_ and then for point _C_ , as indicated in figure 5.7. Similarly, the diamonds on the right side of the table are labeled for point _B_. So, in this example, _A_ = 4, _B_ = 1, and _C_ = 3. Then, the _diamond rule_ is _A − B_ = _C_. In our example, this amounts to 4 − 1 = 3.

It is important to realize that the mathematics of real billiard balls is very complicated, and that the diamond rule is no more than a rule of thumb. In particular, sidespin of the cue ball means that the ball will normally bounce off a cushion at a greater angle than the angle of approach.

So, the diamond "rule" _A − B_ = _C_ is only a guide. However, the rule is sufficiently accurate for planning many shots on a real billiard table. As in the movie, we'll make things easier by pretending that _A − B_ = _C_ holds exactly, and we'll ignore the subtleties of its real-life application.

We now describe how a player can apply the diamond system to plan a shot such as that shown in figure 5.7. In the simplest situation, both the white and black balls are against the left rail, coinciding with the points _A_ and _C_ respectively. Then, since _A_ = 4 and _C_ = 3, we calculate _B_ = _A−C_ = 1. This indicates that, if we aim the white ball at the first diamond on the bottom right, the white ball should exactly follow the path indicated in figure 5.7 and hit the black ball at _C_.

In a more complicated situation, the white ball could be somewhere in the middle of the table with the black ball against the left rail. To find the values of _A_ and _B_ , the player swivels the cue above the white ball, and keeps subtracting the right ( _B_ ) end of the cue from the left ( _A_ ) end, until the resulting subtraction gives the value _C_ ; see figure 5.8.

In our example, _C_ = 2 and the player's guesses are

**Fig. 5.8** Swivel the cue through the white ball until _A − B_ = _C_.

The second subtraction gives the actual value of _C_ , and so the diamond rule instructs us to aim at the second diamond at the bottom right.

Finally, the trickiest situation occurs when the black ball is also in the middle of the table; see figure 5.9. Here, there is no methodical system using the diamonds to determine the correct values for _A_ , _B_ , and _C_. However, an experienced player, with an intuitive feel for the way balls bounce off the rails, will have a good idea of how the angle at _C_ depends on the angle at _A_.

**Fig. 5.9** The most complicated situation.

Here is how an experienced player can use the swivel technique together with intuition for the angle relationship to determine the correct values. Every swivel position corresponds to an _A_ and a _B_ , together with an angle at _A_. The player then calculates _C_ via the diamond rule and guesses the angle at _C_ based on the angle at _A_. Once the position of _C_ and the angle at _C_ are in line with the black ball, he knows that the values are correct and can make his shot.

We can see that the diamond system is a beautiful application of some simple (and some complicated) mathematics, but the Spirit's exposition would hopelessly confuse anybody. Here is the relevant part of the Spirit's explanation, which refers to the complicated situation illustrated in figure 5.9.

_SPIRIT: He uses the diamond markings on the rail as a mathematical guide. First he figures the natural angle_ [at _C_ ] _for hitting the object balls_ [the black ball]. _And then he finds that his cue ball_ [the white ball] _must bounce off the no. 3 diamond. Next he gets ready for the shot, and he needs a number for his cue position_ [ _A_ ]. _This calls for a different set of numbers_ [different labeling]. _You see, the cue position_ [ _A_ ] _is 4. Now, a simple subtraction_ 4 − 3 = 1. _So, if he shoots for the first diamond_ [ _B_ ], _he should make it..._

In effect, the Spirit is suggesting that it is easy to determine the points _C_ and _A_ in figure 5.9 without using the swivel technique, and that the player only needs to perform a simple subtraction to determine _B_ and so guarantee a successful shot.

Of course this makes no sense, because if the white ball is in the middle of the table, then its position together with that of _A_ determines the shot, and so _B_ and _C_ would already be determined, without using the diamond rule at all! What is even funnier is that when Donald tries to use the diamond system, he is in effect applying the swivel technique and gets scolded by the Spirit for doing so.

There are a number of other technical issues that the Spirit ignores. First, as mentioned above, the diamond rule is really just a rule of thumb and is not mathematically infallible as suggested by the Spirit. Second, for the diamond rule to work well, a player is supposed to provide the cue ball with a certain amount of sidespin so that the rebound angles are predictably larger than the approach angles (as is the case in all our diagrams so far). Third, the diamond rule as described in the movie and by us is only part of a more comprehensive diamond system, which also covers cases in which _A_ has to be chosen somewhere along the top rail. Fourth, according to many modern books on billiards, the diamond system works best if you aim directly at the diamonds and not at the rail positions adjacent to the diamonds. Finally, taking into account that the balls have nonzero radius would require slight alterations to all our diagrams.

It is unavoidable that rules for real billiards can only be rules of thumb. On the other hand, it is insightful and fun to figure out what the diamond system would be in an ideal game of _mathematical billiards_. If we assume that the rebound and approach angles of the cue ball are always equal then precise rules are indeed possible. And if we further assume that the cue ball has zero radius, the rules take a very simple form. Using the same labelings as before, we get a _precise_ diamond rule for mathematical billiards:

For example, in figure 5.10 we have _A_ = 4, _B_ = 1 and _C_ = 4. And, indeed

**Fig. 5.10** The angles at _A_ and _C_ are equal, and the diamond rule becomes

In mathematical billiards, we can use exactly the same strategies as those outlined above to plan our shots. Even the situation in which both balls are off the rails is easy. This is because, as is readily checked, the angles at _C_ and _A_ are always equal.

As a final simplification, we can eliminate the peculiar numbering for _A_ , and use the "natural" numbering of the diamonds for all of _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ ; see figure 5.11. Now the diamond rule for mathematical billiards takes the form

_A_ − 2 _B_ = _C_.

It is easy to see why this last rule should be correct. Since the incoming and outgoing angles are always equal, we can unfold the path of the white ball into a straight line. This is shown in the left diagram of figure 5.12, with the new target point _C_ indicated relative to the reflected numbering. It is also clear that the highlighted right-angled triangles are identical. This means that the lengths of the two vertical sides of these triangles are equal, and so _A − B_ = _C_ \+ _B_. That is, _A_ − 2 _B_ = _C_. Q.E.D.

**Fig. 5.11** After simplifying the labeling for _A_ , the diamond rule becomes _A_ − 2 _B_ = _C_.

**Fig. 5.12** Deriving the mathematical diamond rule _A_ − 2 _B_ = _C_ by unfolding the path.

#### **5.6 NOTpick**

Our choice of focus in this chapter has the consequence that we ended up saying a number of not-so-nice things about _Mathmagic Land_. This may leave the impression that we don't like the movie, or that it is not worth watching. Definitely, neither is the case. _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ is an engaging and inspirational movie about mathematics, a must-see for every budding mathemagician. As the Spirit elegantly summarizes at the end of the movie:

_In the words of Galileo: mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the Universe_.

_Donald in Mathmagic Land_ does a very fine job of illustrating Galileo's words.

#### **5.7 Notes**

**Consultants:** Milt Banta, Bill Berg, and Heinz Haber are credited for their contribution to the development of the story of Mathmagic Land. Most likely it was the astrophysicist Dr. Heinz Haber (1913–1990) who was responsible for the math. As a scientist, he became famous for being one of the founders of a new field of research: space medicine. He was also one of the main science popularizers of his time and was involved in several of Disney's other educational productions.

**Mathematics and Billiards:** Other movies in which pool or billiards is played "mathematically" include _Lambada_ (1990) and _Little Man Tate_ (1991). The billiards scene in _Lambada_ makes an amusing supplement to any screening of _Mathmagic Land_. Most notable is the scene in which the hero teacher Blade plans his three-cushion shot using the diamonds and a protractor (figure 5.13)!

**Fig. 5.13** Blade, the cool math teacher in _Lambada_ , using his trusty protractor.

**Comic Book:** Every true fan of _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ should also try to get hold of a copy of the comic book of the same title which appeared in 1959 (Dell comic no. 1051). However, be warned, although it cost only 10 cents when it was published, our copy cost us $30 on eBay.

The comic book covers both more and less mathematics than the movie. Notably, the pi creature gets _π_ correct: "Pi is the Greek letter used to designate the relation of the circumference of a circle to its diameter! Pi is three point one four one five nine two six five."

Donald visits some Stone Age people, as well as ancient Greece, and finds out the hard way why it is useful to be able to count. He also learns about the decimal system and some of the other ways that the ancient people used to note down numbers. Billiards receives a mention, but the diamond system is only hinted at.

In the central story of the comic, Donald meets the mathemagician Nimble Numbo, who shows Donald how to beat Uncle Scrooge and get out of his debt. Here is Donald putting the plan into action (we've streamlined the text a little bit):

_The balance I still owe you is about fifteen dollars, by now, I expect. So, I'll give you my whole house to pay it off! You'll have to pay me a little something extra to make up the difference, naturally_ [Donald gets out a chessboard]. _At least a few pennies, Uncle Scrooge! Here! Here's your chessboard!_

_"I'll settle if you'll just put a penny on the first square and two pennies on the second square and four pennies on the third. Just double the number of pennies each time until you've given me some for every one of these sixty-four squares_.

Of course, the result is 264 − 1 cents, the amount of which comes as a very unpleasant surprise to Uncle Scrooge.

**More Math in Disney Movies:** Mickey Mouse gets tortured with trigonometry in the _Prince and the Pauper_ (1990). Also, in _Dumbo_ (1941), Dumbo manages to blow a cubical bubble, a feat that is actually possible, and with which mathematicians love to amaze their students.

### **Chapter 6  
Escape from the Cube**

In _Cube_ (1997), some very unlucky people wake up in a deadly labyrinth, the Cube, and have to find a way out. Leaven, a math student, does most of the mathematical deciphering. She is assisted by Worth, one of the engineers involved in building the Cube, and Kazan, who is autistic and very good at factoring numbers. The other characters are Alderson, an early victim of the Cube; Quentin, a cop; Rennes, an escape artist; and Holloway, a doctor.

#### **6.1 The Cube in _Cube_**

The mathematics behind the Cube really works. In fact, the Cube was designed by David W. Pravica, a professor of mathematics at East Carolina University. Pravica was also consulted during the making of the movie, but some inconsistencies were introduced during the shooting and editing.

The Cube is a 3D counterpart of the 2D diagram in figure 6.1. It consists of an outer cubical shell, the sarcophagus, and an inner cubical shell. The sidelengths of the outer shell are 434 feet. The inner shell is subdivided into 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576 smaller cubical spaces, each with sidelength 15.5 feet.

The distance between the outer and inner shells of the Cube is also 15.5 feet, and usually this space is empty. At any time, a cubical space is either empty or is occupied by a cubical room. Some of the rooms are booby trapped. Periodically, some of the rooms slide to new locations. It is not clear in the movie whether the rooms are meant to move simultaneously: we discuss this in section 6.5.

Each cubical room has six identical square doors, one in the center of each wall, through which the Cube's captives can move to an adjacent room. At regular time intervals exactly one of the rooms, the bridge, moves out of the inner shell and in front of the only exit in the outer shell. So, to escape the Cube, a captive has to get to the bridge and then wait until the bridge moves in front of the exit; or they must find a room that will be adjacent to the bridge when the bridge is in front of the exit.

**Fig. 6.1** The two-dimensional counterpart of the Cube.

Rennes dies early in the movie (best not to ask how). After his death, the other captives conclude that it would be helpful to have a safe method of identifying booby-trapped rooms. It is possible for them to do this because the builders of the Cube encoded information about the geometry of the Cube, and whether or not a room is safe, into numerical labels in each of the rooms. Furthermore, each captive has a special ability or possesses critical information about the Cube. To begin with, the characters don't suspect any of this.

In the following, we'll have a closer look at how the characters figure out (the hard way) what is going on.

#### **6.2 First Insight: The Power of Primes**

0:11  
The characters have noticed the number labels 566, 472, and 737 in one room and the number labels 476, 804, and 539 in an adjacent room (figure 6.2).

_QUENTIN: What is it, serial numbers?_  
 _HOLLOWAY: Room numbers, they're different in each room_.  
 _WORTH: Oh great, so there's only five hundred and sixty-six million, four hundred thousand rooms in this thing_.  
 _HOLLOWAY: There'd better not be! We have about three days without food and water before we're too weak to move_.

 _QUENTIN: Leaven, what do you do in school? Math?  
HOLLOWAY: What can they mean?_

Leaven puts on her glasses and begins to study the numbers.

_LEAVEN: 149?_

Leaven opens a new door. The numbers we see are 645, 372, and (later) 649.

_LEAVEN: Prime numbers. I can't believe I didn't see it before_.  
 _QUENTIN: See what?_  
 _LEAVEN: It seems like if any of these numbers are prime, then the room is trapped. Okay, 645—645, that's not prime. 372—no. 649—wait, 11 times 59, it's not prime either. So, that room is safe_.

It is unintentionally hilarious that Leaven hesitates before declaring that 645 and 372 are not prime: since the last digits are 5 and 2, it's not as if involved calculations are required. Then, after struggling over the easy ones, Leaven figures out that 649 = 11 × 59 almost immediately.

_QUENTIN: Wait, wait, wait. How can you make that assumption based on one prime number trap?_

_LEAVEN: I'm not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The molecular-chemical thingy had 137, the acid room had 149_.

_HOLLOWAY: You remembered all that in your head?_

_LEAVEN: I have a facility for it_.

#### **6.3 How to Avoid Prime Numbers**

In the rest of the movie, we repeatedly see Leaven, the math expert, trying to figure out whether or not a three-digit number is prime. So, if you woke up tomorrow and found yourself in the Cube, how would you go about this task? As a public service, we now provide a prime number survival guide.

A three-digit number has the form _abc_ : for example, the "molecular-chemical thingy" had label 137, for which _a_ = 1, _b_ = 3, and _c_ = 7. Now, if _abc_ is not prime then it has at least one prime factor no greater than its square root. (Otherwise, there would have to be two larger factors, and their product would be too big.) And, since _abc_ is at most 999, which has square root about 31.6, we have to check for divisibility by the primes up to at most 31.

First, we quickly check whether _abc_ is one of the primes up to 31:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.

Next, we check whether _abc_ is an even number, that is, whether it is divisible by 2: that caused Leaven some difficulty, but of course it's not actually that tough. If _abc_ is an even number then it is not prime, and we are done.

Then we check whether _abc_ is divisible by 3, then for divisibility by 5, then by 7, and so on, up to the largest prime below   As soon as we find a factor we stop, and if we fail to find a factor then _abc_ must be prime.

We now know what we have to do. To actually get through the work quickly, before the Cube does something evil, we just have to employ some well known, and some less well known, divisibility tricks:

2: The number _abc_ is divisible by 2 if its last digit _c_ is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. (Leaven, please take note).

3: The number _abc_ is divisible by 3 if the sum _a_ \+ _b_ \+ _c_ is divisible by 3. For example, 543 is divisible by 3 since 5 + 4 + 3 = 12, and 12 is divisible by 3.

5: The number _abc_ is divisible by 5 if its last digit _c_ is 0 or 5. (Another one for Leaven to practice.)

7: The number _abc_ is divisible by 7 if 2 _a_ \+ 3 _b_ \+ _c_ is divisible by 7. For example, 364 is divisible by 7 since (2 × 3) + (3 × 6) + 4 = 28 is divisible by 7.

11: The number _abc_ is divisible by 11 if _a − b_ \+ _c_ is divisible by 11. For example, 649 is divisible by 11 since 6 − 4 + 9 = 11 is. (Leaven seems to have practiced this trick.)

In fact, there is a divisibility trick for any prime number. Of course, the vast majority of the numbers up to 999 are divisible by 2, 3, or 5. So just the easy divisibility tricks for these three smallest primes should protect us from a lot of Cube traps.

As some final practice before returning to the Cube, let's determine whether 137 is prime. The square root of 137 is a bit greater than 11. Using our divisibility tricks, we quickly convince ourselves that 137 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, and so we conclude that 137 is a prime number.

For a while, Leaven's prime number test works perfectly. However, at some point Quentin almost gets killed in a room whose numbers are not prime. Before Leaven figures out what is going on, the captives stumble across another critical piece of information.

#### **6.4 Second Insight: The Cube in Coordinates**

0:39  
Worth has confessed that he designed the outer shell of the labyrinth, and that he is aware that the overall shape is a cube. However, he doesn't know anything about the structure of the inner shell.

_LEAVEN: What are the dimensions of the outer shell?_

_WORTH: 434 feet square_.

Leaven paces out the room they're in, to determine its dimensions.

_LEAVEN: 14 by 14 by 14_.

_WORTH: The inner cube cannot be flush by the shell. There is a space_.

_LEAVEN: One cube?_

_WORTH: I don't know. It makes sense_.

_LEAVEN: Well, the biggest the cube then can be is—26 rooms high, 26 rooms across, so—17,576 rooms_.

Later, Leaven figures out the importance of the cube being 26 rooms across. Notice that dividing 434 by 14 gives 31, suggesting that 31 × 31 × 31 rooms fit into the outer shell, with 29 × 29 × 29 spaces in the inner shell. However, this does not take into account the thickness of the walls. Assuming the Cube is 28 spaces across and working backward, this suggests that the walls are about 1.5 feet thick, which seems reasonable.

_HOLLOWAY: 17,576 rooms? Oh God, that makes me queasy_.

_LEAVEN: Descartes_.

Leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses.

_LEAVEN: Leaven, you are a genius!_

_QUENTIN: What?_

We see three numbers: 517, 478, and 565.

_LEAVEN: Cartesian coordinates, of course, coded Cartesian coordinates. They're used in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph_.

_QUENTIN: In English. Slower_.

_LEAVEN: Bonjour! These numbers are markers, a grid reference, like latitude and longitude on a map. The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube_.

_QUENTIN: Then where are we?_

Leaven has just figured out that, as well as indicating traps, the numbers in each room also encode its coordinates. The _x_ -coordinate is the sum of the digits in the first number, the _y_ -coordinate is the sum of the digits in the second number, and the _z_ -coordinate is the sum of the digits in the third number. For example, the coordinates of the room with identification numbers 517, 478, and 565 are

(5 + 1 + 7, 4 + 7 + 8, 5 + 6 + 5) = (13, 19, 16).

_LEAVEN: It works! The x-coordinate is 19_.

Here, Leaven scribbles 928 on a piece of metal. This adds to 9 + 2 + 8 = 19, but she is presumably not working on the triple 517 478 565 we were just shown.

_LEAVEN: y is..._

She scribbles 856, giving _y_ = 8 + 5 + 6 = 19.

_LEAVEN: 26 rooms. So_ [because 26 − 19 = 7], _that places us—seven rooms from the edge_.

0:42  
Leaven is puzzling over a new set of coordinates.

_QUENTIN: What's the matter?_

_LEAVEN: These coordinates: (14, 27, 14)_.

Notice that the only way to get a _y_ -coordinate of 27 is if the second identification number is 999. So 27 is definitely the largest coordinate that we will ever come across. However,...

_QUENTIN: What about them?_

_LEAVEN: Well, they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there can't be a coordinate larger than 26. If this were right, then we would be outside the cube_.

This observation will prove to be very important.

#### **6.5 Third Insight: Permutations**

1:04  
The captives try to return to the room containing Rennes's body. Rennes had been killed in an adjacent room, which has since disappeared.

_WORTH: Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?_

Worth opens the door to where Rennes was killed, but there is nothing. All we see is black. It's the outer shell.

_WORTH: How come there's nothing out there?_

_WORTH: Hey! Listen to what I'm saying. There was a room there before. We haven't been moving in circles, the rooms have!_

_LEAVEN: Of course—It's the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot_.

_WORTH: What are you on to, Leaven?_

_LEAVEN: Give me a minute. The numbers are markers, points on a map, right?_

_WORTH: Right_.

_LEAVEN: And how do you map a point that keeps moving?_

_WORTH: Permutations_.

_QUENTIN: Permu—what?_

_LEAVEN: Permutations. A list of all the coordinates that the room passes through. Like a map that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves, and where it moves to_.

It turns out that the three coordinates don't give the present location of a room, only its starting location. However, Leaven has figured out that a room's identification numbers also encode the room's movement through the Cube. We'll explain.

To determine the subsequent locations of a room, we first calculate, for each identification number _abc_ of the room, the following triple of numbers:

_a − b, b − c, c − a_.

Consider the room labeled 665 972 545, where our characters will shortly find themselves. We first calculate

665 → 6 − 6 = 0, 6 − 5 = 1, 5 − 6 = −1.

So the first triple of numbers is 0, 1, −1. Then,

972 → 9 − 7 = 2, 7 − 2 = 5, 2 − 9 = −7

and the second triple of numbers is 2, 5, −7. Finally,

545 → 5 − 4 = 1, 4 − 5 = −1, 5 − 5 = 0.

The third triple of numbers is 1, −1, 0.

To see how these triples govern the movement of the room, we'll follow the room on its journey. To begin, we add the digits of each identification number, and find our room has starting location

(6 + 6 + 5, 9 + 7 + 2, 5 + 4 + 5) = (17, 18, 14).

Now, for the first move, add the first number of the first triple to the _x_ -component, giving

(17 + 0, 18, 14) = (17, 18, 14).

So we haven't gone anywhere. However, for the second move, add the first number of the second triple to the _y_ -component, giving

(17, 18 + 2, 14) = (17, 20, 14).

For the third move, add the first number of the third triple to the _z_ -component, giving

(17, 20, 14 + 1) = (17, 20, 15).

Now, repeat this procedure with the second numbers of each triple, and finally with the third numbers of each triple. So the path continues

→ (18, 20, 15) → (18, 25, 15) → (18, 25, 14)

→ (17, 25, 14) → (17, 18, 14) → (17, 18, 14).

In all, our room has moved nine times, though the first and last "moves," corresponding to the 0s, actually amount to remaining still. At the end of the nine moves, the room has returned to its starting location, and it then cycles through these moves, over and over.

In fact, each room will have a similar cycle, where it returns to its starting location after every nine moves. This is a direct consequence of the sum of the shifts for a room coordinate being ( _a − b_ ) + ( _b − c_ ) + ( _c − a_ ) = 0.

Having figured out the way rooms move about, let's return to see how Leaven is coping:

_QUENTIN: The number tells you all that?_

_LEAVEN: I don't know. See, I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is probably the starting position. All I saw was how the cube looked like before it started to move_ [the initial coordinates of the room].

_QUENTIN: Okay, so it's moving. How do we get out?_

_LEAVEN: 27. I know where the exit is. You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the coordinate larger than 26?_

_WORTH: What about it?_

_LEAVEN: That coordinate placed the room outside the cube_.

_WORTH: A bridge?_

_LEAVEN: Right, but only in its original position_.

_QUENTIN: What are you talking about?_

_LEAVEN: Look, the room starts off as a bridge. Then it moves its way through the maze, which is where we ran into it. But at some point it must return to its original position_.

_WORTH: So the bridge is only a bridge..._

_LEAVEN: For a short period of time. This thing is like a giant combination lock. When the rooms are in their starting positions the lock is open. But when they move out of the alignment the lock closes_.

_QUENTIN: So when does it open?_

_WORTH: For a structure this size—it must take days to complete a full cycle_.

We see Leaven calculating. They are now supposed to be in the room with identification numbers 665, 972, and 545.

_LEAVEN: We find its original coordinates by adding the numbers. The permutation is found by subtracting the numbers. That's it. The room moves to_ 0, 1, _and_ −1 _on the x-axis_ , 2, 5, _and_ −7 _on y, and_ 1, −1, _and_ 0 _on z_.

Leaven has correctly figured out the cycle of movements that we calculated earlier. However, she is about to go further.

_QUENTIN: And what does that mean?_

_LEAVEN: You suck in math? Okay, I need the room numbers around as a reference point_.

Leaven has just figured out that it is possible for her to determine the current position of the room they're in. The trick is to compare the room's cycle of coordinates with those of an adjacent room.

_WORTH: 666—897—466_.

_QUENTIN: 567—898—okay?_

_LEAVEN: Yes!_

_QUENTIN: And 545—Did you get that?_

We, and Leaven, have already calculated that the room they're in, with identification 665 972 545, has the cycle

start = (17, 18, 14) → same → (17, 20, 14) → (17, 20, 15) → (18, 20, 15)

→ (18, 25, 15)* → (18, 25, 14)† → (17, 25, 14)‡ → (17, 18, 14) → same = start.

Now, compare this to the cycle of Worth's adjacent room. Calculating as above, we find that this room cycles through the locations

start = (18, 24, 16) → same → (18, 23, 16) → (18, 23, 14) → same

→ (18, 25, 14)*‡ → same*‡ → same*‡ → (18, 24, 14)† → (18, 24, 16) = start.

If two rooms are adjacent then their coordinates must coincide in two entries and differ by 1 in the remaining entry. This implies that Leaven and her comrades must be at one of three locations indicated by a superscript, with the possible locations of Worth's room indicated by the corresponding superscripts.

We now have to consider a subtle issue of how the Cube was intended to work. The simplest approach would have been to have all the rooms move in sync, which is possibly what was originally intended. If this were the case, then adjacent rooms would not only have comparable coordinates, as we have already indicated, they would moreover be at the same stage of their cycles. For Leaven and co., that leaves two possibilities: they are at (18, 25, 15)*, with Worth's room being at (18, 25, 14)*‡ (five moves into the cycle); or, they are at (17, 25, 14)‡ with Worth's room at (18, 25, 14)*‡ (seven moves into the cycle).

Unfortunately, the Cube in the movie cannot be that simple. If it were, Leaven's room would have crashed into Worth's room at (18, 25, 14), during the sixth move of the cycle. So, either it was intended for the room movements to be out of sync, or this was an error that slipped in during film production.

Whatever the case, at this stage Leaven needs more information. This has been provided by Quentin. The identification numbers for his room are 567, 898, and 545, which gives the coordinate cycle

start = (18, 25, 14)*‡

→ (17, 25, 14) † → (17, 24, 14) ‡ → (17, 24, 15) → (16, 24, 15)

→ (16, 25, 15) → (16, 25, 14)‡ → (18, 25, 14)*‡ → same*‡ → same*‡ = start.

Now, if the above room movements are meant to be in sync, a comparison of coordinates indicates that the only remaining possibility is that Leaven's room is at (17, 25, 14)‡, seven moves into the cycle. Alas, this still cannot work: Worth's and Quentin's rooms are indeed just a step away, but they have also collided at (18, 25, 14)*‡.

Anyway, the director neglected to inform Leaven about colliding rooms, and so she carries on calculating. However, even if the room movements are not in sync, Leaven has sufficient information to determine their location. From the above coordinate cycles there are only two possibilities: either Leaven and the gang are at coordinates (17, 25, 14), with Quentin and Worth peeking into (18, 25, 14) and (16, 25, 14); or they are at (18, 25, 14), with Quentin's and Worth's rooms at (18, 24, 14) and (17, 25, 14). And these two possibilities are distinguishable, since in the first scenario the three rooms are in a line, and in the second scenario the rooms form an L-shape (figure 6.3).

We cannot actually tell from the movie how the three rooms are positioned. However, eventually Leaven in fact concludes that they're at coordinates (17, 25, 14). To do this, she requests more information:

_WORTH: 656—778—462_.

This is supposed to identify a third adjacent room, but a calculation of the room's coordinate cycle shows that this is impossible. Another blooper.

_LEAVEN: That's enough. x is 17, y is 25, and z is 14. Which means this room makes two more moves before returning to its original position_.

_WORTH: Do we have time?_

_LEAVEN: Maybe_.

**Fig. 6.3** The current position of their room is either (17, 25, 14) or (18, 25, 14).

In fact, their room is just one move away from its starting position, since the last "move" has no effect. True, Leaven might be calculating that the Cube as a whole needs two moves to return to its starting configuration. However, that makes only sense if the rooms move in sync. Indeed, at this stage, Leaven's solution of the puzzle makes sense only under that assumption. In which case, we'll have to deal again with all those crashing rooms.

#### **6.6 Final Insight: Prime Powers**

_QUENTIN: Then let's go_.

_WORTH: Can you work out the traps in the system?_

_QUENTIN: Fuck the traps, let's get to the bridge_.

_WORTH: Well, you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot_.

_LEAVEN: Technically I can identify the traps_.

_WORTH: Technically?_

_LEAVEN: First I thought they were identified by prime numbers, but they're not. They're identified by numbers that are the power of a prime_.

_QUENTIN: Okay, so?_

_WORTH: Can you calculate that?_

_LEAVEN: The numbers are huge_.

_QUENTIN: But you can, right? You can?_

_LEAVEN: I'd have to calculate the numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a computer_.

_QUENTIN: You don't need a computer_.

_LEAVEN: Yes, I do—Look! No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the numbers: 567 898 545. There's no way I can factor that. I can't even start on 567. It's astronomical!_

_KAZAN: Two—Astronomical_.

Leaven's done well up until now, but her fears are groundless. First of all, checking for divisibility by 2, 3, and 5 is really easy, and so it's also really easy to check for divisibility by powers of these primes. Then, the only other prime powers Leaven needs to check are

72 = 49, 73 = 343, 112 = 121, 132 = 169, 172 = 189,

192 = 361, 232 = 529, 292 = 841, and 312 = 961.

Given that all their lives depend upon it, this is hardly a lot of extra work.

Anyway, after Leaven makes her "astronomical" remark, they realize that Kazan is really good at counting the factors of numbers. In fact, he gets one wrong (the number of factors of 462), but it turns out not to matter for that particular room.

In the end, Leaven does manage to locate the bridge. However, she winds up dead before having a chance to escape. How typical for Hollywood: the brainy one does all the work, and somebody else reaps the rewards.

#### **6.7 Other Cubes**

There is a sequel to _Cube_ , _Cube 2: Hypercube_ (2002), and a prequel, _Cube Zero_ (2004). We discuss _Cube 2_ in chapter 15 ("Survival in the Fourth Dimension"). The makers of the movie _Cube 2: Hypercube_ (2002) also contacted David Pravica, but were only interested in some random formulas with which to decorate the walls. _Cube Zero_ does not feature any math.

### **Chapter 7  
The Incredible Shrinking Room**

_Fermat's Room_ ( _La Habitación de Fermat_ ) (2007) is a Spanish movie reminiscent of _Cube_ (1997). Four "mathematicians," strangers to each other, are invited to a party by a mysterious host who calls himself Fermat. The pretext is the resolving of a great mathematical problem.

For the duration of the party, the guests are to use the pseudonyms Galois, Hilbert, Pascal, and Oliva. Away from the party, Galois is a math student who claims to have found a proof of the famous Goldbach conjecture, Hilbert is an elderly mathematician, Pascal is an engineer, and all we ever learn of Oliva is that she is very good at chess.

The invitation is a trap, and the four are imprisoned in a square room. They are then confronted with mathematical problems. Whenever they fail to solve a puzzle within the specified time, the walls of the room close a distance in on them (an oldie but a goodie). They are not given much time: over one hour, the walls are set to shrink from about 7 meters in length to just 1 meter.

_Fermat's Room_ has many cute mathematical touches: a boat called _Pythagoras_ ; the Kepler conjecture on the densest packing of balls; characters the same age as their mathematician namesakes were when they died (with the notable exception of Hilbert); many examples of the Goldbach conjecture; and of course the puzzles.

#### **7.1 How Good a Puzzler Are You?**

In this chapter we'll focus on the puzzles confronting the trapped mathematicians. And we'll frame it as a challenge for you; see how well you would fare, if you were trapped in Fermat's deadly room.

To begin, we'll pose a couple of warmups. The first is an easy one, an old chestnut discussed by the four mathematicians while boating on a lake. You'll find the answer to this and all the puzzles at the end of the chapter.

**First warmup puzzle:** A man has to transport a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage across a river in a small rowboat. On each trip, the man can only transport one passenger. When the man is not around, the wolf will eat the sheep, and/or the sheep will eat the cabbage. Devise a plan that will move all three passengers safely to the other side of the river.

The second warmup puzzle is not so easy. It was the preliminary puzzle sent to the four mathematicians, to test their worthiness of an invitation to the party.

**Second warmup puzzle:** What is the principle behind the ordering 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 3, 2?

Warmup's over, here are the rules for our game.

• There are seven puzzles.

• Each puzzle has a time limit of five minutes (in the movie, the times allotted to the puzzles vary). Once the time limit is up, the walls begin moving. Keep track of how much you go over time. If your excess time reaches one hour, we declare you dead.

• To compensate for not having others to help you, if you're stumped by a puzzle you can choose to roll a die. If you roll a 6, we declare you dead. Otherwise, you survive, and can continue with the next puzzle.

• If your answer to a puzzle is not correct, then you have to roll the die.

• No cheating!

Are you ready to go? Good luck!

**Puzzle 1:** A confectioner receives three boxes of candies. One contains only mints, the second contains only chocolates, and the third contains a mixture of the two. The boxes have labels to identify the contents of the boxes. However, the confectioner was informed that all the boxes have changed labels. What is the minimum number of candies that the confectioner has to sample in order to determine the contents of all three boxes?

**Puzzle 2:** Decipher the following message:  
0000000000000001111111110001111111111100111111111110011000100  
0110011000100011001111101111100111100011110001111111110000010  
10101000000110101100000011111110000000000000000.

**Puzzle 3:** Inside a closed room there is a light bulb. Outside the room are three switches in the "off" position. Only one of the switches operates the light; the other two don't do anything. Once you open the door to the room, you cannot go back to move the switches. How can you determine which switch operates the light bulb?

**Puzzle 4:** You have a 4-minute hourglass and a 7-minute hourglass. How can you measure a period of exactly 9 minutes? The hourglasses must always be running: you cannot lay them on their sides.

**Puzzle 5:** A student asks his professor: "What are the ages of your three kids?" The professor answers: "If you multiply the ages you get 36, and if you add them you get my house number." "I know your house number, but that's not enough information!" says the student. To that the professor answers: "True. The oldest lives upstairs." What are the ages of the three children?

**Puzzle 6:** In the Land of Lies, people always lie. In the Land of Truth, people always tell the truth. A foreigner is imprisoned in a room with two doors. One leads to freedom, the other to certain death. The foreigner knows that the guardian of one of the doors is from the Land of Lies, and the guardian of the other door is from the Land of Truth. The foreigner can ask exactly one question of one of the guards. What question does he ask to find his way to safety?

**Puzzle 7:** A mother is 21 years older than her son. In 6 years the mother will be five times the age of her son. Where is the father right now?

#### **7.2 Answers to the Puzzles**

**Answer to the First Warmup Puzzle:** This is a famous puzzle. Google "sheep, wolf, cabbage."

**Answer to the Second Warmup Puzzle:** Consider the number names in alphabetical order: eight, five, four, nine, one, seven, six, three, two. Of course in the movie this is all done with Spanish number names: the starting arrangement is 5, 4, 2, 9, 8, 6, 7, 3, 1, corresponding to cinco, cuatro, dos, nueve, ocho, seis, siete, tres, uno.

**Answer to Puzzle 1:** It is important to note that all the labels have been switched, so that boxes are now definitely incorrectly labeled. Then, choosing one candy from the box labeled Mixed will suffice.

Suppose the candy chosen is a mint (we can give an exactly analogous argument if a chocolate is chosen). Then we know that it is not from the mixed box, so it must be from the mint box. Then, since the chocolates cannot be in the box labeled Chocolates, they must be in the box labeled Mints. That leaves the mixed candies in the third box, labeled Chocolates.

**Answer to Puzzle 2:** There are 169 = 13×13 digits in the sequence, and this is the only nontrivial way to write 169 as the product of two natural numbers. So the key is to write the sequence in 13 rows of 13 digits and interpret 0 as an empty square and 1 as a filled square. The result is a striking picture of a skull (figure 7.1), which is the required answer. In _Fermat's Room_ , Galois uses the front and back of Mahjong pieces to represent the 1s and 0s.

**Fig. 7.1** Interpreting the string of 1s and 0s as a picture yields a...

This puzzle is probably inspired by the famous Arecibo message, a string of 1679 1s and 0s that was beamed to outer space, in the hope that some alien civilization would intercept it and decode it into a 23 × 73 pixel picture.

**Answer to Puzzle 3:** Label the switches 1, 2, and 3. Move switch 1 to the "on" position for a while, then switch it off again. Then move switch 2 to the "on" position, and immediately open the door. If the lamp is on, then switch 2 is connected to it. If the lamp is off and feels warm, then switch 1 is connected to it. Otherwise, switch 3 is connected to it.

In the movie it is actually not specified that we start with the switches in the "off" position. We have to require this for the solution in the movie to work.

**Answer to Puzzle 4:** Start both hourglasses running at the same time. As soon as the 4-minute hourglass runs out, turn it over. Then, when the 7-minute hourglass runs out, turn it over as well. At that moment, there is 1 minute left in the 4-minute hourglass. When the 4-minute hourglass runs out again (1 minute later), 8 minutes will have passed. Now turn over the 7-minute hourglass, which will run for 1 minute, giving a total of 9 minutes.

**Answer to Puzzle 5:** The product of the three children's ages being 36 means there are the following possibilities: (1, 1, 36), (1, 2, 18), (1, 3, 12), (1, 4, 9), (1, 6, 6), (2, 2, 9), (2, 3, 6), and (3, 3, 4). Since the student knows the house number, and since this is not enough information, two of the triples must sum to the house number. Checking the triples, the only possibility is that the house number is 13, with the ages being either (1, 6, 6) or (2, 2, 9). The final clue is that there is only one oldest child, and so the ages must be (2, 2, 9).

**Answer to Puzzle 6:** This is a famous puzzle, related to the liar paradox. Here is one solution. The prisoner chooses a guard, points to the door he's guarding, and asks: "If I had asked you yesterday whether you are guarding the door to freedom, would you have said 'Yes'?" It is easy to check that, no matter the guard, a "Yes" means the door is the door to freedom and a "No" means the door leads to death.

The liar puzzle also features prominently in _Labyrinth_ (1986) and _The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser_ (1974), and the liar paradox itself appears in _Bedazzled_ (1967). In _Kaspar Hauser_ , the puzzle is misstated by a pompous professor of logic, who asks Kaspar to determine whether the questioned man is a liar or truthteller: Kaspar's trivial and very funny solution is to propose asking the man whether he is a tree frog.

**Answer to Puzzle 7:** If the mother's age is _M_ and the son's age is _S_ , then

_M_ = _S_ \+ 21 and ( _M_ \+ 6) = 5( _S_ \+ 6).

**Fig. 7.2** Hilbert is figuring out the solution to Puzzle 7.

Solving for _S_ gives   and so the son is negative 9 months old. So, the father is not too far away from the mother.

How did you do? Are you still alive?

#### **7.3 Notes**

There are several other movies in which puzzles play a crucial role. In _Cutting Class_ (1989), a teen slasher flick, the killer sets a word problem involving trains: the answer indicates which door leads to safety. (The protagonists get it wrong.) In _Tom & Viv_ (1994), Viv, T. S. Eliot's wife, is required to solve a few clever mathematical brainteasers to avoid being committed to a mental asylum. In _I.Q_. (1994), Tim Robbins has to solve some puzzles to prove that he is mathematically worthy of Meg Ryan. Other interesting puzzles are listed in chapter 17 ("Problem Corner"). In _Die Hard: With a Vengeance_ (1995) Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson need to solve a number of puzzles or face certain death. One of these is one of the oldest mathematical puzzles in recorded history: "As I was going to St. Ives, I meet a man with seven wives, every wife had seven sacks, every sack had seven cats, every cat had seven kittens. Kittens, cats, sacks, and wives, how many were going to St. Ives? My phone number is 555-... " What is the number that completes this phone number?

### **Chapter 8  
Murder in the Hot House**

We were just trying to put the finishing touches to this book, when we received a call from the props department of the Australian cop series _City Homicide_. In a forthcoming episode, "Hot House," they were planning on killing a couple of (fictional) mathematicians. To get things right, they wanted to talk to some (nonfictional) mathematicians. Of course, we were delighted to assist.

#### **8.1 The Story**

In "Hot House" (2010), two mathematicians are murdered. The first, Christopher Bolingbroke, is a former professor of pure mathematics at the University of Melbourne. He is now spending his time coaching brilliant math students, including his own son Harry. The second victim is Gordon Neandes, a failed mathematician. He has been "hot housing" his two brilliant children, Andrea and Liam, to have them achieve where he could not.

Harry also never made it and is currently working as a government statistician. Andrea escaped six years ago and is working as a high class prostitute. Andrea's younger brother Liam is still being tutored by Bolingbroke.

At the beginning of the show, Bolingbroke is found strapped to a chair, with his body covered by stab wounds and mathematical writing. We subsequently learn that he was forced to do the writing himself, and that the stab wounds were crossings out of his mistakes. Later, Neandes is killed in the same manner.

It turns out that Andrea and Harry met by chance, and then planned and executed their fathers' murders, both out of revenge and to save Liam. Ironically, Liam really enjoys the math and didn't need saving.

**Fig. 8.1** Professor Bolingbroke, one of the murdered mathematicians.

#### **8.2 Let's Kill Some Mathematicians**

When we were first contacted by Kate and Slavko, the guys in charge of the props department of _City Homicide_ , they were mainly after some writing samples for the body math, and some math-filled whiteboards and the like. In the end, we did all the displayed mathematics for the episode, checked the mathematics in the script, supplied a couple of tons of math books for props, and spent a few fascinating days on set watching the episode being created.

The script had Bolingbrook and Neandes interested in prime numbers and the Riemann hypothesis, and we chose the equations accordingly (figure 8.1). A careful look at the blackboards shows them to be mainly analytic number theory. In particular, the writing on the two bodies was borrowed from Bernhard Riemann's paper "Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse," and from the chapter dedicated to this paper in Harold Edwards's classic book, _Riemann's Zeta Function_. Not the cutting edge research called for in the script, but definitely beautiful mathematics that we hoped would look great on TV.

**Fig. 8.2** Professor Bolingbroke, with Marty on the left and Burkard on the right.

The math bodies were supposed to be prominent, and it was clear that the crew were keen to create as powerful an effect as possible. So we went on an initial trip to the Melbourne studio to practice on a trial body, and to plan it all with Kate and Slavko, the makeup department, and Kate Woods, the director.

Slavko had located some special pens that tattoo artists use for sketching their designs. They also hired a trial corpse, Luigi. He was an interesting and talkative fellow: as we drew on him, we learned of his quirky theories of love, shoes, and Cinderella.

In our trial run, we covered half of Luigi and then met with the director. After some back and forth, it was decided that we would pretty much cover all visible parts of the body with formulas. The writing on the torso was plausible. From figure 8.2, you can see how we tried to orient the writing to make it look as if Bolingbroke did it himself.

The writing on the legs down to the toes made less sense. The victim was to have his legs and left arm strapped down, with only the right arm left free to write. Bound in this way, Bolingbroke and Neandes wouldn't have been able to write so far down. However, Kate Woods had the idea of having the camera pan along the whole leg, following one line of writing (figure 8.3). The end result was quite spectacular, and certainly justified the minor fudging of reality.

We have very different handwriting, and the initial plan was to have Burkard decorate one body and Marty the other. However, during the actual filming, it was all too hectic and so we worked together on each body. Together, it took us about 45 minutes to finish a body. In any case, the writing on the skin was sufficiently indistinct for it not to matter.

**Fig. 8.3** Leonhard Euler's famous formula, relating the prime numbers to the Riemann zeta function:

#### **8.3 The Writing on the Wall**

Apart from decorating mathematicians, we were also very occupied filling the whiteboards and blackboards that appear in the mathematicians' offices and in Liam's room. Slavko arranged for the whiteboards to be dropped off at Burkard's home. A "few" whiteboards turned out to mean fifteen whiteboards that required filling. It took half the night (figure 8.4).

We decided to fill Liam's boards mostly with pretty calculus: a proof that

the derivation of the reduction formula for

a proof that

**Fig. 8.4** Marty at work on one of the whiteboards.

and two popular proofs that

One of Liam's whiteboards was a collage of some of mathematics' all-time classic formulas and one-line proofs; see figure 8.5.

#### **8.4 Let's Run Away and Join the Circus**

Altogether, we were required to be on set for three days over a period of two weeks. After decorating a body, we would stick around, just in case we were required. There was little for us to do, but it was great fun watching the filming, chatting with the cast and crew, getting in the way, but also feeling part of a great team.

We were always given the feeling that everybody was very happy to have us around, and that they were as interested in and as bemused by us as we were by them. It was clear that our efforts to give the episode an authentically mathematical feel were genuinely appreciated.

**Fig. 8.5** A mathematical collage for Liam, featuring our mascot QEDcat.

The lasting impression was of the general friendliness and collegiality, on everyone's part. It was all shoestring and incredibly rushed, but it was also impressively human: academia could learn a thing or two. A memorable and thoroughly enjoyable little adventure.

### **Chapter 9  
A Word Problem for Die Hards**

In _Die Hard: With a Vengeance_ (1995), John (Bruce Willis) and Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) have been set a little problem by the villain, Simon (Jeremy Irons). It involves some jugs.

0:58  
 _SIMON_ [via a mobile phone] _: I trust you see the message_. [The bomb] _has a proximity circuit. So, please don't run_.

_JOHN: Yeah, I got it. We're not gonna run. How do we turn this thing off?_

_SIMON: On the fountain, there should be two jugs, do you see them? A 5-gallon and a 3-gallon. Fill one of the jugs with exactly 4 gallons of water and place it on the scale and the timer will stop. You must be precise, one ounce more or less will result in detonation. If you're still alive in five minutes, we'll speak_.

_JOHN: Wait, wait a second. I don't get it. Do you get it?_

_ZEUS: No_.

_JOHN: Get the jugs. Obviously, we can't fill the 3-gallon jug with 4 gallons of water_.

_ZEUS: Obviously_.

_JOHN: All right. I know, here we go. We fill the 3-gallon jug exactly to the top, right?_

_ZEUS: Uh-huh_.

_JOHN: Okay, now. We pour that 3 gallons into the 5-gallon jug. Giving us exactly 3 gallons in the 5-gallon jug, right?_

_ZEUS: Right, then what?_

_JOHN: All right. We take the 3-gallon jug and fill it a third of the way..._

_ZEUS: No. He said be precise. Exactly 4 gallons_.

_JOHN: Shit! Every cop within 50 miles is running his ass off, and I'm out here playing kids games in the park... Look, we can't take this off, it will detonate. Just wait, wait a second. I got it! I got it! Exactly 2 gallons in here, right?_

_ZEUS: Right_.

_JOHN: Leaving exactly 1 gallon of empty space, right?_

_ZEUS: Yeah_.

_JOHN: A full 5 gallons here, right?_

_ZEUS: Right_.

_JOHN: You put 1 gallon out of 5 gallons in there, we have exactly 4 gallons in here_.

_ZEUS: Yes!_

_JOHN: Come on. Don't spill any. Good good good. Exactly 4 gallons_.

_ZEUS: You did it, McClane!_

We consider a general and elegant method of tackling this kind of problem. It is based on playing billiards on a special table.

#### **9.1 Playing Billiards with the Die Hard Problem**

We use the parallelogram-shaped billiard table shown in figure 9.1.

**Fig. 9.1** Parallelogram billiards solves John and Zeus's jug problem.

The dimensions of the table are 5 units by 3 units, and the angles at the corners are 60 degrees and 120 degrees, as pictured. We introduce natural coordinates, so that the lower left corner is at (0, 0) and the upper right corner is at (5, 3). Then we place a ball at the lower right corner (5, 0), and shoot the ball as indicated. As the ball bounces off the edges of the table, we record the bounce points:

(5, 0) → (2, 3) → (2, 0) → (0, 2) → (5, 2) → (4, 3) → (4, 0) → etc.

This sequence corresponds to John's solution of Simon's problem as follows:

(5,0): fill the 5-gallon jug;

(2,3): fill the 3-gallon jug from the 5-gallon jug, leaving 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug;

(2,0): empty the 3-gallon jug;

(0,2): empty the 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug.

(5,2): fill the 5-gallon jug.

(4,3): fill the 3-gallon jug from the 5-gallon jug, leaving 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.

Following the ball further, it continues from (4, 3) and traverses all the inner lines on the table exactly once, before stopping at the upper left corner. The complete path is

(5, 0) → (2, 3) → (2, 0) → (0, 2) → (5, 2) → (4, 3) → (4, 0) →

(1, 3) → (1, 0) → (0, 1) → (5, 1) → (3, 3) → (3, 0) → (0, 3).

In particular, notice that the path of the ball includes the following points on the top and bottom edges of the table:

(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)

and

(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3).

Of course, 0 and 8 gallons are very easy to arrange. So, no matter the number of gallons, up to 8, that Simon might have demanded, John and Zeus could have satisfied him.

You've probably figured out why this works. The lines parallel to the _x_ -axis represent filling or emptying the 5-gallon jug, while leaving the 3-gallon jug untouched. Similarly, the lines parallel to the _y_ -axis represent filling or emptying the 3-gallon jug. The other lines represent pouring as much as possible from one jug into the other. So we can begin the path at (5,0), and then all the indicated actions are permissible under Simon's rules.

The diagram contains a second solution to Simon's problem. Place the ball in the upper left corner and shoot in the opposite direction from before. This is the same route but traversed in the reverse direction. It gives the solution to Simon's problem as

(0, 3) → (3, 0) → (3, 3) → (5, 1) → (0, 1) → (1, 0) → (1, 3) → (4, 0).

#### **9.2 A Recipe**

Our first solution can be summarized as an algorithm, an example of the general recipe for solving jug problems. Beginning with both jugs empty, the key steps are as follows:

1. If the 3-gallon jug is full then empty it.

2. Pour as much water as possible from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug.

3. If there is water left in the 5-gallon jug, then return to step 1. Otherwise

4. Fill the 5-gallon jug and return to step 2.

With this approach the water always flows as follows:

fountain >> 5-gallon jug >> 3-gallon jug >> fountain.

To obtain the second solution, in the above recipe replace every 3 by 5 and every 5 by 3. For this solution, the water flow is reversed.

#### **9.3 Thwarting a Different Simon**

What if tomorrow it's your turn? Simon hands you a 10-gallon jug and a 6-gallon jug, and you're required to obtain exactly 9 gallons of water. You could construct a 10 × 6 parallelogram table to try to solve the puzzle (figure 9.2).

However, even without the table it is easy to see that it is impossible to obtain a solution. Notice that 10 and 6 have a common factor of 2. So, no matter how we fill or empty the jugs, the amounts of water will only be multiples of 2. It follows that it is impossible to obtain exactly 9 gallons. Pictorially, only every second line of the billiard table is traversed.

**Fig. 9.2** The spacing of the path indicates the greatest common divisor of 15 and 6.

In general, the only amounts we can possibly obtain from two jugs are multiples of the greatest common divisor of the jugs. Conversely, it can be demonstrated that any (small) multiple of the greatest common divisor can indeed be obtained using the parallelogram method; for details check out the references at the end of this chapter.

This also leads to billiard tables providing a pictorial method of finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Construct the table corresponding to the two numbers and draw the complete path. Then the greatest common divisor is the number of spaces between the traversed lines.

#### **9.4 The Least Common Multiple**

Given two number _m_ and _n_ , we know that

least common multiple of _m_ and

So, any method for calculating greatest common divisors, such as our billiards method, also provides a method for calculating least common multiples. In fact, there is also a direct billiards method:

1. Make a rectangular billiard table of length _m_ and width _n_.

2. Place the ball at a corner and shoot it at 45 degrees. See figure 9.3 (where _m_ = 15 and _n_ = 6).

**Fig. 9.3** Using a rectangular billiard table to calculate the least common multiple.

Now, count the number of times the ball travels between the left and right edges before arriving at a corner. Then the least common multiple of _m_ and _n_ is the product of _m_ and this travel number. In our illustrated 15 × 6 example, the ball travels twice between the left and right edges: the least common multiple of 15 and 6 is 15 × 2 = 30.

Alternatively, the least common multiple is _n_ times the number of trips between the top and bottom edges. In our example, this amounts to 6 × 5 = 30.

There are a number of excellent references on jug problems and on the closely related _decanting problems_ or _Tartaglian measuring problems_. See, in particular:

### **Chapter 10  
7 × 13 = 28**

A number of Abbott and Costello's memorable routines have a mathematical flavor. The clear standout is the donut scene in _In the Navy_ (1941). Lou Costello plays Pomeroy, a baker, and Bud Abbott is his friend, Smokey.

1:06  
 _SMOKEY: Hey, donuts!_

_POMEROY: No, Smokey! Don't!_

_SMOKEY: Oh, come on. One donut_.

_POMEROY: I haven't got enough. I can't afford it. I just baked twenty-eight of these things. Well, after all there are seven officers I've got to feed and I've just got enough to give them—thirteen apiece_.

Understandably, Smokey demands a proof that 7 × 13 indeed amounts to 28. Pomeroy obliges, in spades. (In what follows, we indicate in bold each new step of Pomeroy's calculations.)

#### **10.1 First Proof: Bogus Division**

_POMEROY: There were seven officers. There's a seven. Now I'm going to divide to prove it to you_ [figure 10.1]. _Now, twenty-eight donuts_.

**7** | **28** |

_POMEROY: Now, seven into two. You couldn't even push that big seven into that little two. Therefore we can't use the two. I'm gonna let Dizzy hold it. I'll use it later. Now, seven into eight—One_.

7| 28 | **1**

_POMEROY: Now, we're gonna carry the seven. It's getting a little heavy, so I'll put it right down there_.

**Fig. 10.1** 28 ÷ 7 = 13.

_POMEROY: Seven from eight—One_.

_POMEROY: Now, a minute ago, we didn't use the two. I'm gonna use it now. Dizzy, give me back the two. Thanks. Put it right down there_.

_POMEROY: Now seven into twenty-one?  
SMOKEY: Three times_.

_POMEROY: 7—28—13.  
SMOKEY: Now wait a minute!_

#### **10.2 Second Proof: Bogus Multiplication**

_SMOKEY: Put down thirteen up there_ [figure 10.2]. _Now you claim that each officer gets thirteen donuts? Put down seven, draw a line. Now seven times thirteen is what?_

**Fig. 10.2** 13 × 7 = 28.

_POMEROY: Twenty-eight_.

_SMOKEY: Prove it_.

_POMEROY: Seven times three?_

_SMOKEY: Twenty-one_.

_POMEROY: Seven times one_.

_SMOKEY: Seven_.

_POMEROY: Seven and one?_

_SMOKEY: Eight_.

_POMEROY: Two_.

#### **10.3 Third Proof: Bogus Addition**

_SMOKEY: Oh no. Come on. We add this up. Put down thirteen seven times_ [figure 10.3].

**Fig. 10.3** 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 = 28.

_SMOKEY: Now we're getting it. You claim all this added up amounts to what?_

_POMEROY: Twenty-eight_.

_SMOKEY_ [adding up the 3s from the bottom to the top] _: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21,..._

_POMEROY_ [takes over, adding the 1s from the top to the bottom] _: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28!_

#### **10.4 Play it Again, Abbott**

As for most of their routines, Abbott and Costello employed the 7 × 13 = 28 skit a number of times. They did an excellent version in _Little Giant_ (1946). On TV, it appears in _The Colgate Comedy Hour_ (1952) and in _The Abbott and Costello Show_ (1953).

The routine actually long predates Abbott and Costello. In his book _Knotted Donuts and Other Mathematical Entertainments_ , Martin Gardner traces it back to Irvin S. Cobb's 1923 anthology of jokes, _A Laugh a Day Keeps the Doctor Away_. It is possible that Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles performed the routine in the 1921 Broadway show _Shuffle Along_ ; if so, they almost certainly performed it much earlier on the vaudeville stage.

Probably the earliest filmed version appears in the short film _Jimtown Speakeasy_ (1928), in which Miller and Lyles prove 3 × 17 = 24. In 1951, Miller and Ches Davis performed the 7 × 13 = 28 version in _Yes Sir, Mr. Bones_. In the same year, Ma and Pa Kettle proved 5 × 14 = 25, in _Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm_. Finally, Flip Wilson and a young Michael Jackson did a fine job with 7 × 13 = 28 on _The Flip Wilson Show_ (1972).

**Fig. 10.4** Michael Jackson performing the routine on the _Flip Wilson Show_.

#### **10.5 General Bogus Math**

Martin Gardner discusses the question originally posed and answered by mathematician William R. Ransom: Is there something special about the numbers 7, 13, and 28 that makes this routine work? Clearly not, as demonstrated by the routines of Lyles and Miller and Ma and Pa Kettle. Exactly which combinations of numbers work?

To tackle this question, let's write the three numbers as _n_ , _lr_ , and _LR_. Here, _l_ and _L_ indicate left digits, and _r_ and _R_ indicate right digits. So, for example, the routine 7 × 13 = 28 arises from choosing _n_ = 7, _l_ = 1, _r_ = 3, _L_ = 2, and _R_ = 8.

Abbott's bogus multiplication then takes the form _n × lr_ = _LR_ , and his calculation becomes

So in order for the bogus multiplication to work we require that

_n_ · ( _r_ \+ _l_ ) = _LR_.

A little calculation then shows that this equation also suffices for the bogus addition and bogus division. However, for the division routine to work neatly in the way Abbott performs it, we also require that _n_ goes into _R_ at least _l_ times, but not _l_ \+ 1 times. That means, we also require

_n · l_ ≤ _R < n ·_ ( _l_ \+ 1).

With these two observations, it is not hard to work through all the possible candidates. Consider _n_ = 7, for example. Since 7 · _l_ ≤ _R_ , we must have _l_ = 1, and the only possibilities for _R_ are 7, 8, and 9. The only multiplications by 7 giving such last digits _R_ are 7 × 4 = 28 and 7 × 7 = 49. These give us the two bogus multiplications 7 × 13 = 28 and 7 × 16 = 49.

The following is the complete multiplication table:

One Mirror Has Two Faces, Two Mirrors Have...**

_The Mirror Has Two Faces_ (1996) is an unusual story for Hollywood: boy meets girl, boy and girl have trouble, and eventually both live happily ever after.

Okay, maybe not that unusual. However, in this case the boy is math professor Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges). Greg is seeking a simple and sex-free relationship. The lucky girl is Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand), a professor of literature and keen on romance.

The movie is full of mathematics: conversations about prime numbers, calculus lectures, and eye-catching blackboards. If you're a typical mathematician, surviving in a bewildering, unmathematical world, it is the movie for you.

Watch this movie together with friends and impress them by identifying the obscure mathematical tidbits and by pointing out the crazy bloopers. Maybe borrow some mathematical-romantic lines to impress a nonmathematical love interest. Or, if you're a teacher, you might try Rose's advice on how to add zing to your classes. This chapter can be your guide.

#### **11.1 Real Life**

Nothing beats living in a purely mathematical world, as Greg sums up admirably at his book launch:

0:04  
 _GREG: As I stand here at the end of the journey, I am reminded of something Descartes once said: For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three will always make five, the square can never have more than four sides, and it does not seem possible that truths so clear and apparent can be suspected of any uncertainty_.

That is all well and good, but what about real life? Felicia, the expert on the sex hotline that Greg consults, has some sound advice:

0:10  
 _FELICIA: Life is very complex, there are no guarantees_.

_GREG: Why should that be? The mathematical world is completely rational, completely uncomplicated by sex_.

_FELICIA: You think too much, Honey_.

#### **11.2 Prime Numbers**

If you're hunting for dinner conversation that is simultaneously mathematical and romantic, you may want to go for the twin prime conjecture:

0:30  
 _GREG: It is interesting how coupling occurs throughout nature and in mathematics_.

_ROSE: Oh yeah, you were telling me something about pairs_.

_GREG: Oh, the twin prime conjecture. Yes, well, it explores pairs of prime numbers, numbers that are only divisible by themselves: 3-5, 5-7, not 7-9, because..._

_ROSE:... 9 can be divided by 3_.

_GREG: That is right. That's right. Then you have 11-13, 17-19, and so on, and what was discovered was that what often occurred were pairs that were separated by..._

_ROSE:... one number in between_.

_GREG: Exactly, exactly_.

_ROSE: This twin prime conjecture is interesting. What would happen if you counted past a million. Would there still be pairs like that?_

_GREG: I can't believe you thought of that. This is exactly what is yet to be proven in the twin prime conjecture_.

Rose has a great idea for a present for a mathematician boyfriend:

0:51  
 _GREG: What are these? Dice?_

_ROSE: They once were dice, but now they're cufflinks with..._ [figure 11.1]

_GREG: Prime numbers!_

_ROSE: 2, 3, 5, no 9_.

And don't miss out on any opportunity to make that special moment mathematical:

1:32

_GREG: My number here is 01712577355... All prime numbers, by the way_.

At this stage, Rose isn't talking to Greg. Things are looking bad. So it's understandable that a distracted Greg totally forgets that 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

As Greg becomes more distressed, he takes his frustration out on his students:

**Fig. 11.1** Prime number cufflinks—the perfect present for that mathematician boyfriend.

1:45

_GREG: D_ [the grade assigned to the student's paper]. _Congratulations, you're improving_.

_STUDENT: I still don't understand what you're saying about twin primes_.

_GREG: I'm explaining it to you_.

_STUDENT: But I still don't understand_.

It's probably not that hard, but Greg's explanation is very unlikely to help:

_GREG: Don't you know that it is possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still have an infinite number of elements left over. We spent quite a bit of time on this already. Christ, my wife understood this on our first date!_

Greg is right, of course. For example, removing all the even numbers from the natural numbers still leaves the infinitely many odd numbers. However, this observation about infinity doesn't tell you a whole lot about twin primes.

#### **11.3 Calculus**

This movie is a great source of calculus clips. In the very first scene, Greg is having a blast proving a theorem. Of course, his students are bored to tears.

0:01

_GREG: f_ ( _x_ ) = _e y times _e x_, which is what we were trying to prove. Notice the elegance of the proof. It's beautiful. It actually reminds me of a quote by Socrates: If measure and symmetry are absent from any composition in any degree, it ruins both the ingredients and the composition. Measure and symmetry are beauty and virtue the world over_.

Flowery language, but it is indeed an elegant proof. We've reconstructed the blackboards, the numbers indicating the order to follow (figure 11.2). Greg is proving the law for the product of exponential functions (blackboard 4), an "aside" to the second definition of the exponential function (blackboard 3). The proof itself is an application of the chain rule for differentiation (blackboards 5 and 6).

**Fig. 11.2** The first wall of blackboards. Greg begins with the top equation of board 5.

In this scene, we also catch a glimpse of Greg's textbook: _Calculus—A Computer Algebra Approach_ by I. Anshel and D. Goldfeld. The textbook also appears later, when Greg is talking about implicit differentiation:

0:27

_GREG: Implicit differentiation is often thought of as complex, but in reality it is quite simple. In reality, it's simply a matter of pretending that y is a function of x and so..._

**Fig. 11.3** Differentiating the symmetries of an equilateral triangle?

At this point, we have an elephant-sized blooper. Greg's words are fine, but he is also pointing to a blackboard detailing the symmetries of equilateral triangles (figure 11.3): absolutely nothing to do with implicit differentiation.

In a later scene, Greg actually applies implicit differentiation:

0:38

_GREG: x squared plus y squared equals 16. How do we find_   _as an implicit function of x and y? Well y is a function of x, so we differentiate both sides_. _The left-hand side is pretty easy, what is the left-hand side? The left-hand side is_ 2 _y_.

**Fig. 11.4** Greg demonstrates his brilliant lecturing technique.

Greg has just finished writing the " _x_ squared." The chain rule is written as   and Greg seems to have differentiated the function _f_ ( _x_ ) = cos( _x_ 2 \+ 2 _x_ ) (figure 11.4). Then, setting _y_ = _x_ 2 \+ 2 _x_ , we obtain

Greg is a boring lecturer, and he knows it. He asks for help from Rose, who is a charismatic humanities lecturer. This leads to a couple of scenes featuring the simple math of constant acceleration.

0:39

_ROSE: Come on, teach me something, anything_.

_GREG: Okay, if a ball is thrown into the air and its height h_ = 100 _t_ − 16 _t_ 2.

_ROSE: Gregory you see, what are you doing? Turn around, turn around, talk to me!_

_GREG: Okay, t is time in seconds. What limit is the speed approaching when t approaches..._

_ROSE: You lost me. Put it in some context. Make up a story, jazz it up a little bit, find some humor in it_.

_GREG: Humor in calculus?_

_ROSE: Hmm. Well, try telling a story_.

Later, in class, Greg returns to this topic. On one of the blackboards is written   and the other contains standard formulas for motion under constant acceleration.

_GREG:... equation such as the second derivative of the function f with respect to the variable x equals a constant..._

A student yawns, prompting Greg to try Rose's suggestion:

_GREG: Anybody see the game yesterday? That Marrakesh, what a bum, hey? Let me try putting this another way. When measuring trajectories, if a batter hits a ball, how can we determine how far that ball will go? What are the variables needed to hit a home run, pretending for a moment that the bum could hit a home run_.

_STUDENT: The velocity with which the ball leaves the bat_.

_GREG: The velocity, correct_.

Actually, a math lecturer can immediately recognize the above conversation to be a bit of a blooper. It is highly improbable that Greg's spooned-on relevance would actually entice the bored students. Especially so, since Greg's heart is clearly not in it: like many pure mathematicians (pun intended), Greg is uninterested in baseball. However, Rose eventually makes him see the light:

1:06

_GREG: I don't see the point of playing a game where you wind up at the same spot where you started_.

_ROSE: Well, actually this should interest you because it's about stats and averages_.

_GREG: Stats and averages? Explain that to me_.

_ROSE: Well, see, every time a player comes up, they flash this three-digit number and that is the player's average. That is, how many times he hits the ball in ratio to how many times he comes up to bat_.

If you watch the movie carefully, you'll notice many more calculus fragments on the blackboards: sine curves, regions under functions ripe for integration, and so on.

#### **11.4 Mathematical Miscellany**

Pointing out the above details should be sufficient to engage nonmathematical companions. However, to impress mathematicians, more is definitely required. To that end, we now offer a survey of the beautiful mathematics lurking in the background of the movie (almost none of which has an ounce of relevance to Greg's calculus course).

_Be warned, there is some high-level mathematics peeking out of those blackboards. So, don't worry too much about the details. When need be, simply admire the graphics, and record to memory those very impressive buzzwords_.

0:16

The two diagrams on the bottom right blackboard in figure 11.5 show the simplest knot, the _trefoil knot_. illustrated as a _torus knot_. The middle blackboards appear to be _Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams_ , indicating the singularities of the algebraic curves given by the adjacent equations. (The reconstruction in figure 11.6 contains a bit of guesswork.)

**Fig. 11.5** Newton's diverging parabolas, Dynkin diagrams and the torus knot.

**Fig. 11.6** Greg's Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams.

The left blackboards appear to show two examples of _Newton's diverging parabolas_. The bottom curve with the cusp, _y_ 2 = _x_ 3, is the so-called _semicubial parabola_ , or _Neile's parabola_. The other curve, _y_ 2 = ( _x_ 2 − 1)( _x − a_ ), is one of _Newton's egg curves_.

0:27

Rose is in front of a bulletin board, to which is pinned a very pretty graphic (figure 11.7). The original can be found on the website for the software application _Quasitiler_. As is explained there, the _Penrose tiling_ that forms the background of the picture is obtained by "projecting a slice of a regular lattice in five-space onto three-space, and the one-skeleton of a five-cube projected onto three-space." Boy!

**Fig. 11.7** A Penrose tiling.

1:07  
The camera swings across a _Möbius strip_ , a "dodecahedral space," the Dynkin diagrams again, to the Newton curves (which have been changed); see figure 11.8.

**Fig. 11.8** The net of a dodecahedron, a Möbius strip, and some new Newton curves.

1:45

In the final classroom scene, we see some blackboards describing a predator-prey model. This material can be found in most introductory texts on differential equations and fits in well enough with Greg's calculus lectures. However, the blackboards in the back of the room are much more exotic.

**Fig. 11.9** More beautiful and completely arbitrary mathematics to decorate the movie.

From right to left, the blackboards feature an alternating knot (of course immediately recognizable as the 76 knot in Tait's classical list!); the Borromean rings; Sierpinski's carpet fractal; the graph of a damped oscillation; and some spiral thingy (figure 11.9). All beautiful mathematics, and all pretty much irrelevant to a subject on calculus and differential equations.

#### **11.5 The Other Mirror**

_The Mirror Has Two Faces_ is very loosely based on the 1956 movie with the same title. This movie is less of a Hollywood story: boy meets girl, boy and girl marry, girl gets a face lift, and boy kills plastic surgeon. Like Greg, the French boy is a teacher of mathematics. However, there is only one mathematics scene, in which he is relentlessly grilling one of his students (figure 11.10).

0:50

_STUDENT_ [reading off the blackboard] _: "What is the smallest number containing three digits?"_ [Student writes 000.]

_TEACHER: No, Monsieur Biniole_. [While he is waiting he is slapping a ruler into his palm. The student writes 111.]

_TEACHER: No, Monsieur Biniole_. [The student scratches his bottom.] _It's no use scratching like that. You won't find the answer in the seat of your pants_.

**Fig. 11.10** The smallest number containing three digits?

Actually, 000 seemed like a very reasonable answer to us. Unfortunately, just as Monsieur Biniole starts to write again, the scene ends. It seems we're fated to never know what the smallest three-digit number really is.

#### **11.6 Notes**

The math consultant for _A Mirror Has Two Faces_ was the mathematician Henry Pinkham from Columbia University. In an interesting article in the _New York Times_ , Pinkham recalled his experience coaching Jeff Bridges. It seems Bridges "went to a lot of effort to learn lines that would be convincing from a mathematical point of view." Apparently, Bridges even adopted a few of Pinkham's mannerisms. However, Pinkham also made it clear that the boring lecturing was not modeled on him. He assured the readers that his own teaching "is at a higher level of interest," and that the math professors at Columbia "know how to tell a story."

### **Chapter 12  
It's My Turn for Some Serious Mathematics**

To our knowledge, _It's My Turn_ (1980) is the only movie with a scene dedicated to the detailed proof of a mathematical theorem. It is astonishing to have such a scene begin a Hollywood movie. Perhaps even more astonishing, the proof is correct.

This movie is also one of the few to mention the mathematical field of group theory. It is the only movie we know of that refers to the classification of the finite simple groups, one of mathematics' holy grails.

The math consultant for the movie was Benedict H. Gross, a professor at Harvard University. To understand more of how the movie came to be, we contacted Professor Gross, and he kindly responded to our many questions. We have incorporated a number of his very informative replies.

_Please be warned, there is some high-level mathematics on the road ahead. If you are not familiar with this mathematics, then we recommend you simply marvel at it, as was intended, and just enjoy the ride. In any case, please buckle your mathematical seat belts!_

#### **12.1 The Snake Rears Its Lovely Head**

The main character is Kate Gunzinger (Jill Clayburgh), a math professor in Chicago. The theorem she is proving is the famous _snake lemma_ from homological algebra:

**Snake Lemma:** _Suppose we have the commutative diagram_

_in some Abelian category. Then there is a long exact sequence_

0 → ker _α_ → ker _β_ → ker _γ_ → coker _α_ → coker _β_ → coker _γ_ → 0.

Of course, if you are unfamiliar with all the jargon then this won't make a bit of sense. And this is neither the time nor the book for a lesson on homological algebra. But as a hint to what this is all about, the capital letters in the diagram stand for mathematical worlds of the same type (such as vector spaces or groups), and the arrows stand for special functions between these worlds (homomorphisms).

It is the first scene of the movie, and on Kate's blackboard the snake lemma takes the form shown in figure 12.1.

**Fig. 12.1** Kate's rendering of the snake lemma.

At the beginning of the scene, the whole diagram is already visible on the blackboard, except for the long curved arrow; see figure 12.2. Kate must prove the existence of the special function corresponding to this long arrow. Having done so, she adds the arrow, completing the diagram.

The designation "snake" obviously refers to the form of this arrow, and there is good reason for representing the arrow in this manner. The object ker _α_ is associated with _A_ , coker _α_ is associated with _A′_ , and so on. Then the arrow joins the right side of the top row to the left side of the bottom row of the commutative diagram, and so naturally takes the shape of a snake.

**Fig. 12.2** Kate proving the snake lemma.

Comparing the two screenshots above, we can detect a small blooper: the _g_ in the right shot has been rewritten as a _q_ in the left shot. This shows that this scene took more than one take, and one can see why. In fact, according to Gross, the scene "took quite a number of takes. Clayburgh memorized the mathematics like you or I might memorize a greeting in Chinese, syllable by syllable." It has to be said, she did a fine job:

0:01

_KATE: Let me just show you how to construct the map s, which is the fun of the lemma anyhow, okay?_ [This map _s_ corresponds to the long curved arrow.] _So you assume you have an element in the kernel of γ, that is, an element in C, such that γ takes you to 0 in C′. You pull it back to B, via map g, which is surjective,..._

_COOPERMAN_ [the student from hell] _: Hold it, hold it. That's—that's not unique_.

_KATE: Yes, it is unique, Mr. Cooperman, up to an element in the image of f, all right? So we've pulled it back to a fixed b here and then you take β of b, which takes you to 0 in C′, by the commutivity_ [should be commutativity] _of the diagram. It is therefore in the kernel of the map g′, hence is an image of f′ by the exactness of the lower sequence..._

_COOPERMAN: No_.

_KATE:... so we can pull it back to an element in A′..._

_COOPERMAN: It's not well defined_.

_KATE:... which it turns out is well defined modulo the image of α, and thus defines an element in the cokernel of α_ [at this point she draws the snake arrow], _and that's the snake. And on Monday we'll address ourselves to the cohomology of groups_ [Cooperman raises his hand], _and Mr. Cooperman's next objections_.

At the end of the scene, Kate raises the blackboard to reveal another blackboard underneath. It contains three basic statements about sequences of maps in homological algebra (figure 12.3).

**Fig. 12.3** Basic homological algebra.

There are a couple more incomplete blackboards visible in the scene. Only one can be reconstructed with any confidence (figure 12.4). According to Gross, it was probably "intended as a homework problem on homological algebra."

**Fig. 12.4** Homological homework.

#### **12.2 The Classification of Finite Simple Groups**

The classification of finite simple groups, completed around 1981, was one of the crowning achievements of twentieth century mathematics. The proof, the joint effort of over a hundred mathematicians, is comprised of over 15,000 pages in over 500 journal articles, published between the late 1940s and the early 1980s. The classification theorem states the following:

_Every finite simple group is isomorphic to a group of prime order, an alternating group A n, one of the finite groups of Lie type, or one of 26 sporadic simple groups_.

The sporadic simple groups are some of the weirdest and most wonderful creatures in the whole of mathematics, arguably the most bizarre of which is the humongous _monster group_. Five of these sporadic groups had been known since the middle of the nineteenth century. The remaining twenty-one, including the Monster, were only discovered between 1965 and 1975.

Gross remarks upon this aspect of the movie: "When I first read Bergstein's script, she had Kate working on the theory of Abelian groups. I told her that this was not of much interest at the moment, and that she should move her into the classification of the sporadic simple groups. There were many other mathematical impossibilities, and I was amazed when she told me that the movie was going into production in two weeks."

Directly after the snake lemma scene, reference is made to Kate working on groups.

_COOPERMAN: This stuff is just garbage. That's another diagram chase. When are we going to move on to something interesting, like your new group. Any progress with the 2-fusion?_

_KATE: No, still stuck_.

_COOPERMAN: Maybe you have gone as far as you can with it Dr. G_.

_KATE: That's possible_.

_COOPERMAN: I've started looking at it with a whole new angle_.

_KATE: Oh?_

_COOPERMAN: If it works, I'll be famous_.

_KATE: Oh, that would be terrific. I can relax. I'll be famous for having taught you_.

0:07

Spurred into action by Cooperman's dig at her, Kate begins calculating on the back of an envelope. Homer, her clueless boyfriend, is keeping her company.

_KATE: I'd like to kill that little Cooperman. Now, he is working on the 2-fusion, Jesus. You know what I'd like?_

_HOMER: What?_

_KATE: If I could just solve this problem. You understand, I would be in a class with Euclid and Newton, really, I would be—except for Newton made his breakthrough when he was 22_.

Here is Gross on the mathematics of this scene: "I forget (what is written on this envelope), although the diagram on top is probably a modified Dynkin diagram, much used in the study of sporadic finite groups. You can find similar diagrams in the Atlas. I think the series was supposed to be a Thompson series, giving the character values of an infinite sequence of representations on a fixed conjugacy class. These turn out to be modular forms for certain sporadic groups, like the Monster. It was all new mathematics at the time of the filming."

0:17  
A conversation with the professors interviewing Kate for a new position.

_FIRST PROFESSOR: Jeremy Grant at Yale. He is a great fan of your thesis. Have you done any new work on your group yet?_

_KATE: No, not yet_.

_FIRST PROFESSOR: I broke my back on group theory. It has moved way past me now. You younger minds have to take over_.

_SECOND PROFESSOR: Has your work come to a standstill, Dr. Gunzinger?_

_KATE: I certainly hope not_.

0:20

Kate is at dinner with her father and others.

_FATHER: How did the interview go?_

_KATE: I should have kept my mouth shut. I don't think I'm going to get it_.

_FATHER: That doesn't sound like you. This is the girl who got one hundred on every math exam except for 98 in plane geometry. Her thesis was on sporadic groups_.

_GUEST: Tell me, what did you get wrong in plane geometry?_

_KATE: The problem was to compute the area of a patio around a pool. I applied the right method, but I put the patio inside the pool_.

1:25

Back on her home campus, Kate runs into Cooperman.

_COOPERMAN: Did you make any progress?_

_KATE: Well, I tell you I have been thinking. I think, I have been looking in the wrong place. I have some new ideas about the 2-fusion_.

_COOPERMAN: What? Why? Do you mean dot o to dot g?_

_KATE: Right, just in its simplest case, though_.

_COOPERMAN: But that might be the hinge of the whole problem. Yeah, right away that's going to give you the quotient, that's immediate_.

_KATE: It's just a beginning, though_.

_COOPERMAN: Show me what you are talking about_.

_KATE: I can't do it now_.

_COOPERMAN: Show me_.

_KATE: I'm going to be here for a while_.

_COOPERMAN: The classification might even drop right out. This is incredible. If this works, we could be famous_.

_KATE: Listen, it's just the beginning. The tough part is working it out_.

We never find out whether they solve the problem.

#### **12.3 Questions and Answers**

We did our best to exhaust Professor Gross with our many questions on how the movie math came to be. The following is some of our conversation.

**Question:** In the movie it is not quite clear what Kate is actually trying to do. On the one hand, people refer to "her group" which seems to indicate that she already found a sporadic finite simple group as part of her dissertation. On the other hand, she is still trying to do something with it. Clearly, this was not really developed in the movie. Do you still remember what people had in mind here? And what about this 2-fusion business?

**Answer:** They didn't care that she has a serious research problem. Just that the language was impressive and essentially correct.

**Question:** How did you get involved in the making of this movie?

**Answer:** I was an instructor at Princeton, where Bergstein was living at the time. She asked the department chair, Hale Trotter, if she could visit the class of a young mathematician in the department, to model a character (played by John Shea, but cut from the final version). After coming to class, she took me to lunch and showed me the script. When I came across the Abelian group stuff, I suggested that she needed some help, and that got me involved. My main contribution was the opening scene on the snake lemma.

**Question:** Did you or any other real mathematician by any chance make an appearance in the movie?

**Answer:** Not that I know of. I tried to keep my distance, and asked not to be in the credits.

**Question:** Was that your handwriting on the blackboards?

**Answer:** I can't remember. Probably. I was flown out to Hollywood for the filming of the math scenes.

**Question:** Are there any other interesting anecdotes that come to mind?

**Answer:** When I protested at the line that Clayburgh used about being over twenty, therefore incapable of doing math, and suggested that it be modified to being over thirty, I was told that it was impossible for Clayburgh to admit in a movie that she was over thirty. Otherwise she couldn't get leading parts. [ _This scene did not make it into the movie_ ].

#### **12.4 Notes**

**The Movie in the Math:** The snake lemma scene is mentioned in some advanced math texts, such as C. A. Weibel, _An Introduction to Homological_ _Algebra_ (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995) and C. L. Schochet, The topological snake lemma and corona algebras, _New York Journal of Mathematics_ 5 (1999), 131–137.

**Commutative Diagrams in Movies:** There are two other movies we know of that feature commutative diagrams. In _The Spanish Prisoner_ (1997), we see someone leafing through a notebook filled with math, and one of the pages contains a commutative diagram.

In _Antonia's Line_ (1995) the wunderkind of the family, Thérèse, becomes a math professor. In one scene, she is working on a blackboard containing a commutative diagram (figure 12.5).

**Fig. 12.5** The mathematical prodigy Thérèse, in _Antonia's Line_.

1:11

_THÉRÈSE: We can assume that the singular chain complex of the empty set equals zero. With theorem 5.8 this implies that the nth homology group is the same as the nth relative homology group, if we take as the subspace the empty set. Now we can construct a functor from the category of Top_ 2 _to the category of chain complexes. Define the functor S* as follows: S* of the ordered pair_ ( _X, A_ ) _becomes the quotient of the singular chain complex of the space X by the complex of A_.

This seems close to making mathematical sense. But only close.

## **Part II  
Mathematics**

### **Watch those clips!**

In this second part of the book, we incorporate the material from many movies into mathematical surveys. It is not essential to have seen the clips beforehand. On the other hand, it definitely wouldn't hurt. Fortunately, many of the clips are available online from the usual sources, and we maintain a list of links to these clips on our website.

### **Chapter 13  
Beautiful Math, or Better Off Dead**

There are two kinds of people: those who think that math is beautiful; and those who think that those who think that math is beautiful are crazy. On occasion, one of the former meets one of the latter, and chances are that they'll talk about mathematics. These conversations tend to be short. For example, in _Teresa's Tattoo_ (1994), Teresa, a math PhD, is attending a faculty party, and Rick looks to flirt with her:

0:11

_RICK: You know, Bruno tells me that you're in the Physics Department?_

_TERESA: Math_.

_RICK: Math Department..._

_TERESA: See ya_.

_RICK: Bye_.

Sometimes, however, the math fan will be intent on sharing her passion. The level of success can vary dramatically. We consider here three approaches, as exemplified in the movies.

#### **13.1 The Direct Approach**

A true math fan always dreams that the uninitiated will be receptive. So they're forever tempted to try the direct approach, even if it seldom seems to work. The fantasized encounter is presumably something akin to the hilarious classroom scene in _Better Off Dead_ (1985). Here, we can admire Mr. Kerber in full flight (figure 13.1).

**Fig. 13.1** Mr. Kerber, lecturing to his adoring fans.

0:22

_MR. KERBER: The three cardinal, trapezoidal formations, hereto made orientable in our diagram by connecting the various points, HIGK, PEGQ and LMNO, creating our geometric configurations, which have no properties, but with location_.

_CLASS: Aah!_

_MR. KERBER:... are equal to the described triangle CAB quintuplicated. Therefore, it is also the five triangles composing the aforementioned NIGH each are equal to the triangle CAB in this geometric concept_ [laughter] _! Therefore, in a like manner, the geometric metaphors can derive a repeated vectoral sum. This was your assignment. I would like to see the results, please. Take them out—Sophia_.

_CLASS: Oh! Oh! Me!_

_MR. KERBER: And—Buster_.

_CLASS: Me! Me! Please!_

_MR. KERBER: And Beth. And..._

_CLASS: Oh, please, please!_ [The bell rings to end the class.] _Aww!_

_MR. KERBER: Now, now, now. I'll see you all tomorrow. Just remember to memorizepages 39 to  for tomorrow's lesson_.

_ALL: All right!_

_STUDENT: Cool!_

_SECOND STUDENT: Mr. Kerber really just makes geometry live!_

However, even in a fantasy world, a receptive audience can be pushed too far. Such is clearly the case with Pierre Richard's frenetic lesson in _Lucky Pierre_ (1974) (figure 13.2).

**Fig. 13.2** Lucky Pierre and his lucky students.

And there's not much to say about Eddie Murphy's efforts to teach unified field theory to the eight-year-old kids in _Meet Dave_ (2008) (figure 13.3).

**Fig. 13.3** Getting a youthful start on unified field theory.

Of course, the reality is much likely to resemble Professor Larkin's experience in _The Mirror Has Two Faces_ (1996); see chapter 11. Similarly, Mikey doesn't fare very well with Sandy, as they discuss their homework in _The Ice Storm_ (1997):

0:24

_SANDY: Hey, Mikey!_

_MIKEY: Yeah?_

_SANDY: Geometry?_

_MIKEY: Sure, anything but this English_.

_SANDY: How come you're so good at math but not at English?_

_MIKEY: I'm not good at math. Just good at geometry. It's like, you know when they say "two squared"? You think it means 2 times 2 equals 4? But they really mean a square. It's really space, it's not numbers, it's space. And it's perfect space, but only in your head, because you can't draw a perfect square in the material world. But in your mind you can have perfect space. You know?_

_SANDY: Yeah. But I just need some help with my homework_.

#### **13.2 The Poetic Approach**

As suggested by the above, the direct approach tends to fall flat with the uninitiated. However, more subtly hinting at the hidden beauty of mathematics can work very well. Here are five scenes which exhibit what we call the poetic approach.

In our first scene, Gerald Lambeau, the Fields-medal-winning mathematician in _Good Will Hunting_ (1997), is trying to win over a female student:

0:29

_LAMBEAU: A difficult theorem can be like a—symphony. It's very erotic_.

_STUDENT: Wow_.

Well, perhaps that "Wow" was less than sincere. Mathematician Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is more successful with Cristina (Naomi Watts) in _21 Grams_ (2003):

1:11

_PAUL: There is a number hidden in every act of life, in every aspect of the Universe. Fractals, matter—that there's a number screaming to tell us something. Am I boring you?_

_CRISTINA: No, no_.

_PAUL: I'm sorry. I guess I try to tell them that numbers are a door to understanding a mystery that's bigger than us. How two people, strangers, come to meet. There's a poem by a Venezuelan writer that begins: "The Earth turned to bring us closer. It turned on itself and in us until it finally brought us together in this dream."_

_CRISTINA: That's beautiful_.

_PAUL: There's so many things that have to happen for two people to meet and—Anyway, that's—that's what mathematics are_.

The poetic approach indeed works very well for Paul: he gets the girl.

In _Enigma_ (2001), Tom Jericho is a brilliant mathematician (modeled on Alan Turing, one of the top codebreakers at Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom during WWII). He poeticizes to his girlfriend Claire about mathematics:

0:21

_CLAIRE: Why are you a mathematician? Do you like sums?_

_TOM: I like numbers. Because with numbers, truth and beauty are the same thing. You know you're getting somewhere when the equations start looking beautiful and you know the numbers are taking you closer to the secret of how things are_.

Well, it turns out that Claire is a foreign spy, after Tom's secrets. Still, she seemed to appreciate the speech.

Our next scene is from _Smilla's Sense of Snow_ (1997). Smilla, the Green-lander ice-maiden heroine, is sharing a glass of wine with Andreas:

0:48

_SMILLA: The only thing that makes me truly happy is mathematics, snow, ice, numbers. To me the number system is like human life. First you have the natural numbers, the ones that are whole and positive like the numbers of a small child. But human consciousness expands and the child discovers longing_.

_Do you know the mathematical expression for longing? Negative numbers, the formalization of the feeling that you are missing something. Then the child discovers the in between spaces, between stones, between people, between numbers and that produces fractions, but it's like a kind of madness, because it does not even stop there, it never stops. There are numbers that we can't even begin to comprehend. Mathematics is a vast open landscape. You head toward the horizon and it's always receding, just like Greenland_.

Smilla makes a great speech, and it seems to have the desired effect upon Andreas. True, Andreas was already totally in love with her, but let's give a little credit to Smilla's mathematical musings.

Finally, in _A Pure Formality_ (1994), novelist and murder suspect Onoff (Gérard Depardieu) is interviewed by a police inspector (Roman Polanski). Onoff muses on the ideals of mathematics:

1:15

_INSPECTOR: Ever seen this man, Mr. February?_

_ONOFF: Seems to me I know him_.

_INSPECTOR: Who is he?_

_ONOFF: My math teacher when I was in high school_.

_INSPECTOR: What else?_

_ONOFF: It's to him I owe my passion for numbers, for symmetry, for geometric reasoning. Professor Trivarchi: he set forth theorems as if they were fables. His words didn't go through our ears, they went directly to our minds. And I was truly moved: "Two parallel lines can never meet. Nonetheless, it is possible to imagine the existence of a point so far out in space, so far into infinity that we can believe and acknowledge that our two lines do in fact meet there. We shall call this point the ideal point."_

The inspector is a fan of Onoff's, and is very impressed by his speech; not so impressed, however, that he doesn't later charge Onoff with murder. Well, he may be a murderer, but Onoff gives a beautiful presentation of the subtle idea behind _projective geometry_. We hope he'll get time off for good (mathematical) behavior.

#### **13.3 The All-Singing, All-Dancing Approach**

For those who find poetry too subtle, an alternative is to flamboyantly break into a song and dance. It may not be a method employed often to sell mathematics, but when it is the results can be unforgettable.

In _Are You With It?_ (1948), Donald O'Connor plays Milton Haskins, an actuary who misplaces a decimal point, resigns in disgrace, and hooks up with a carny. After a drink, Milton explains that dancing is "merely a question of applied mathematics." He demonstrates 3 × 2 = 6, then 6 × 2 = 12, followed by "the square root of that raised to the fourth power." Milton then launches into a terrific tap dancing routine. (He appropriately refers to a momentary stumble as "calculus.")

In _Merry Andrew_ (1958), Danny Kaye plays a teacher seeking to enthuse his students. His leading them in a song about Pythagoras's theorem seems to do the trick (figure 13.4); see chapter 14.

**Fig. 13.4** A merry Danny Kaye leads his young charges in a Pythagorean singalong.

_Merry Andrew_ is difficult to top, but _30 Virgins and Pythagoras_ (1977) may just do it. This remarkable movie stars Czech heartthrob Karel Gott as a singing math teacher, and his classes are certainly like no other. As in _Merry Andrew_ , Pythagoras's theorem seems to be the theorem of choice to sing about (figure 13.5).

**Fig. 13.5** Karel Gott, teaching a very tuneful Pythagoras.

#### **13.4 Any Place, Any Time**

Whatever the approach, a math fan tends to choose the moment carefully. However, it is not strictly necessary. In _Stand-In_ (1937), mathematician Atterbury Dodd (Leslie Howard) extols mathematics in masterly fashion, while engaging in accountancy:

2:55

_ATTERBURY_ [dictating]: _I am honored by your invitation to address my alma mater. In the past, however, I have encountered difficulties persuading my hearers that the science of mathematics is not one of mere figures and geometrical designs_.

_CLERK: 3 o'clock, Mr. Dodd_.

_ATTERBURY: One minute past, you are late—but a science more important to life than food and drink, a science—_ [to another clerk] _that account should have been out last night—without which there could be no music, no poetry, no art_.

_CLERK_ [showing Dodd a balance]: _This balance, Mr. Dodd._

_ATTERBURY_ [immediately]: _There is an error in the addition. The total should be 1296321—the flight of the bird_.

_CLERK: The adding machine..._

_ATTERBURY: Have the adding machine fixed—the leap of the salmon, the rhythm of the dance, all are mathematical_.

### **Chapter 14  
Pythagoras and Fermat at the Movies**

_Pythagoras's theorem_ and _Fermat's last theorem_ are two of the superstars of mathematics. In this chapter we'll see what the movies can, and cannot, teach us about these megatheorems.

#### **14.1 Pythagoras's Theorem**

In _The Wizard of Oz_ (1939), the Scarecrow is off to see the Wizard, hoping to get a brain. The Wizard grants the Scarecrow his wish, more or less, by awarding him a Doctor of Thinkology. The Scarecrow then tests his newly gained intelligence by having a go at some mathematics:

1:26

_THE SCARECROW: The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side—Oh, joy! Rapture! I've got a brain!_

The Scarecrow is definitely impressed, but nobody actually familiar with Pythagoras's theorem would be. Let's state clearly the Scarecrow's errors: first it should be "squares" instead of "square roots"; second, "any two sides" should be "the shorter two sides"; third, "isosceles triangle" should be "right-angled triangle."

The Scarecrow's errors removed, we now have:

**Pythagoras's Theorem (Non-Scarecrow Version)**  
The square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle  
is equal to  
the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides.

Of course, for many people Pythagoras's theorem amounts to the mantra: " _a_ squared plus _b_ squared equals _c_ squared." In symbols,

_a_ 2 \+ _b_ 2 = _c_ 2.

However, a triangle must be hidden in that equation somewhere. And, actually the "squares" really are (the areas of) squares. These squares abound in the song "Thanks, Mr. Pythagoras," from the remarkable _30 Virgins and Pythagoras_ (1977) (figure 14.1).

**Fig. 14.1** An inspired choice of triangle, and its Pythagorean squares.

In _Merry Andrew_ (1958), Danny Kaye plays the new teacher at a boarding school, where the boys have been raised on rote learning. He seeks to excite them, and succeeds brilliantly by singing and dancing "The Square of the Hypotenuse." It is a difficult movie to obtain, but the scene is a must-see.

_Though scientific laws may change  
and decimals can be moved,  
the following is constant  
and has yet to be disproved.  
The square of the hypotenuse  
of a right triangle_  
 _is equal to the sum of the squares  
of the two adjacent sides..._

Andrew finishes the dance by arranging himself, the boys and a string of flags into a large, very impressive right-angled triangle (figure 14.2).

**Fig. 14.2**... is equal to the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides.

Andrew is too busy being merry to actually offer the boys a _proof_ of Pythagoras's theorem. In _The Man Without a Face_ (1993), a disfigured and much less merry Mel Gibson is also teaching geometry, and he does provide the proof of a Euclidean theorem. Alas, Mel's proof is incorrect; see chapter 18 ("Money-Back Bloopers"). So, though Mel demands that his student state Pythagoras's theorem, it's probably a relief he didn't also demand a proof.

In _Late Bloomers_ (1996), we hear an actual proof of Pythagoras's theorem, by the teacher, Miss Groshardt. The proof itself is a famous one by way of similar triangles, and small glimpses of it appear on the blackboard. The closest to a visual proof is the background diagram in figure 5.1, and a similar diagram in the episode "Youth + Vampire" of the anime series _Rosario_ \+ _Vampire_ (2008). In this episode, we see part of the famous windmill proof of Pythagoras's theorem behind the teacher Ririko. Given Ririko's, um, enthusiastic teaching style (figure 14.3), we regret that she didn't work through the proof in detail.

**Fig. 14.3** A voluptuous presentation of the Pythagorean windmill.

#### **14.2 Fermat's Last Theorem**

Pythagoras's theorem means that every right-angled triangle gives rise to three positive numbers _a, b_ , and _c_ that satisfy the equation

_a_ 2 \+ _b_ 2 = _c_ 2.

_Pythagorean triples_ are triples of _natural numbers_ that satisfy the equation. The simplest Pythagorean triple, which most people will recall from schooldays, is

32 \+ 42 = 52.

Are there others? Yes, lots. And, it was probably the existence of Pythagorean triples that made mathematicians wonder about other powers. Are equations such as

_x_ 3 \+ _y_ 3 = _z_ 3, _x_ 4 \+ _y_ 4 = _z_ 4, _x_ 5 \+ _y_ 5 = _z_ 5, _..._

also satisfied by some natural number triples? Captain Picard summarizes the story of this problem at the beginning of the _Star Trek_ episode "The Royale" (1989):

_PICARD: Fermat's last theorem. You familiar with it?_

_RIKER: Vaguely. I spent too many math classes daydreaming about being on a starship_.

_PICARD: When Pierre de Fermat died, they found this equation scrawled in the margin of his notes. x n_ \+ _y n_ = _z n where _n_ >_ 2, _which he said has no solution in whole numbers. But he also added this phrase: Remarkable proof_.

_RIKER: Yeah, it is starting to come back to me. There was no proof included_.

_PICARD: Hmm, and for 800 years people have been trying to solve it_.

_RIKER: Including you_.

_PICARD: I find it stimulating. Also, it puts things in perspective. In our arrogance, we feel we are so advanced and yet we cannot unravel a simple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician working alone without a computer_.

Later, Picard sums up his crew's confusing adventure:

_PICARD: Like Fermat's theorem, it's a puzzle we may never solve_.

Captain Picard has most of the story correct. To begin, we have

**Fermat's Last Theorem**  
If _n_ is a natural number greater than 2,  
then _x n_ \+ _y n_ = _x n_ has no natural number solutions _x, y_ , and _z_.

In 1637 the "part-time" (but extremely gifted) mathematician Pierre de Fermat really did jot down the following note in one of his math books: "I have a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain." It is also true that for a long time nobody was able to prove or disprove this claim. However, 357 years later, and five years after the _Star Trek_ episode, Princeton University mathematician Andrew Wiles finally managed to come up with a proof.

It's hard to blame the scriptwriter for the above lines of Captain Picard. In 1989 few mathematicians, except for Wiles, held much hope that Fermat's last theorem would soon be solved. It seemed entirely plausible that mathematicians would still be chasing the theorem centuries later.

In any case, the _Star Trek_ team catches on fast. In the _Deep Space Nine_ episode "Facets" (1995), Dax raises the problem:

_DAX: I've been working on finishing your proof of Fermat's last theorem...  
O'BRIEN/TOBIN: You have?_

_DAX: It's the most original approach to the proof since Wiles's over three hundred years ago..._

_O'BRIEN/TOBIN_ [flattered] _: Thanks..._

It is not clear whether Dax is implying that Wiles's proof is wrong, or just that she has been working on a new proof. If the former, then maybe Picard was right after all.

Either way, to prove Fermat's last theorem is hellishly difficult. In _Bedazzled_ (2000), Elizabeth Hurley plays the Devil, and in one of her incarnations she is leading astray a classroom of boys (figure 14.4):

**Fig. 14.4** A devilish homework problem.

1:01

_DEVIL: Okay, boys. Tonight's homework_. [She walks to the blackboard.] _Algebra: x to the nth plus y to the nth equals z to the nth. Well, you're never going to use that, are you?_ [She wipes out the problem, and everybody laughs.]

The "SHOW YOUR WORK" on the board appears to be a very funny jibe at Fermat, as if he were a negligent schoolboy for not including his proof.

In _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer3" (1995), we see the following equation floating in Homer's 3D world:

178212 \+ 184112 = 192212.

If the equation were correct then it would be a counterexample, demonstrating Fermat's last theorem to be false. And, checking on a calculator, it may well seem to be correct: _The Simpsons_ team have worked hard on that one. However, closer inspection makes clear that the equation cannot possibly be correct: the left side is definitely odd, and the right side is definitely even. In fact, properly evaluating the right and left sides gives

2, 541, 210, 258, 614, 589, 176, 288, 669, 958, 142, 428, 526, 657

and

2, 541, 210, 259, 314, 801, 410, 819, 278, 649, 643, 651, 567, 616.

Two huge numbers, differing by a huge amount, but nonetheless agreeing in the first nine digits.

In a later episode, "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" (1998), the Simpsons have another poke at Fermat's last theorem:

398712 \+ 436512 = 447212.

This time, both sides are even numbers, so the previous even-odd trick doesn't work. However, Wiles can rest assured that the equation is nonetheless false: the left side is divisible by 3 (since both 3987 and 4365 are), whereas the right side is not (since 4472 is not).

#### **14.3 Fermat's Last Tango**

_Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001) is a mathematical musical, perhaps the first ever. It is the work of husband-and-wife team Joshua Rosenblum and Joanne Sydney Lessner, and in 2000 was presented off Broadway by the York Theatre Company. A DVD of a live performance is available from Boston's Clay Institute.

To do _Fermat's Last Tango_ justice, we would have to include the whole transcript. It probably contains more mathematicians and more higher mathematical references than all other movies combined. And it is terrific fun. We'll reluctantly restrict ourselves to summarizing the story, and detailing some of the best dialogue.

The story begins with Daniel Keane (=Andrew Wiles) announcing his proof of _the_ theorem. Daniel is an immediate celebrity, with everybody wanting to meet him. In fact, even Pierre de Fermat stops by, claiming to have

... _discovered a marvelous method of time travel, which this attic is not large enough to..._

In reality, Fermat is visiting from the AfterMath, where the really famous mathematicians from the past are basking in their glory. Keane has just earned his place in the AfterMath, and ostensibly Fermat has come to invite Keane to meet with Pythagoras, Euclid, Newton, and Gauss. When we first encounter the Fab Four, they are harmonizing:

0:24

_Sing me to Symmetry  
Muse of the Mathematic  
We worship all equations_

_the simple and quadratic_

_Algebra, Geometry, Set and Number Theory  
All admired equally  
In our Purgatory and Pythagorean secret society_.

However, it turns out that the preponderance of large egos means that not all is harmonious in the AfterMath. Also, it turns out that these mathematicians, great as they are, are from mathematically simpler times: Keane's proof is too modern and too complicated for them. Moreover, Fermat is not at all happy that somebody else has found a proof of _his_ theorem. It all explodes when Fermat gleefully announces that he has discovered a "big, fat hole" in Keane's proof:

0:33

|

---|---

_KEANE: A hole?_

|

_EUCLID and NEWTON: A hole?_

|

_KEANE: My proof contains a hole?_

|

_FERMAT: I didn't want to be the one to say_.

|

_I know this is upsetting_ ,

|

_please show some self-control_ ,

|

_but your proof contains a big, fat hole!_

|

_PYTHAGORAS:_ | _EUCLID, NEWTON, GAUSS:_

_Make no mistake about it_ , | _ooh, ooh_

_if this defect you can mend_ , | _shoo-bi-doo-doo-wah_ ,

_an offer of admission_

|

_we will cheerfully extend_. | _ooh, ooh_ ,

_But until the time arrives_ | _shabada-boo_ ,

_you are forbidden to enroll_ , | _ah, ooh, olé_.

_'cause your proof contains a big, fat hole!_

|

A despondent Keane retreats to his attic to try to fix his proof. Fermat hangs around, to gloat and to confuse him.

0:42

_FERMAT:  
I don't intend to lose my immortality,  
and share with some two-bit professor!  
A person who in raw intelligence  
is so obviously my lesser_.

Now we know! And the other residents of the AfterMath know, too; they are getting very annoyed with Fermat, and hope to "wipe his smirk from his face." They decide to update their mathematical knowledge and help Keane fix the hole. In the end they fail, and in admitting defeat they acknowledge Keane's amazing achievement in getting as far as he did. They admit Keane to the AfterMath.

**Fig. 14.5** Pythagoras, Newton, Gauss, and Euclid, with Fermat on air double bass.

Luckily, Keane also has a staunch supporter in his wife Anna. Not so lucky for Anna, as she sees herself as a "math widow" (as indeed are all math wives and math husbands). However, just as Keane is about to give up, Anna, who doesn't know a thing about mathematics, remarks:

0:79  
 _ANNA: It's often said, "Within your failures lie the seeds of your success."_

This leads Kean to reconsider an approach that he had previously given up on. Now, in a new light, this old approach is the answer to his prayers. And they lived happily ever after.

But what about Fermat and his proof? Did he also have a proof? Well, even he is happy after Keane, with a bow to Fermat, pronounces:

0:83  
 _KEANE: His proof was so simple,  
he claimed it was simple,  
and I believe that what he said was true.  
But since through the centuries,  
no one has conjured it_,  
 _you could almost say Fermat was  
the most brilliant mathematician  
the world has ever known_.

_Fermat's Last Tango_ is a must-see. It is historically accurate, it doesn't dodge the mathematics, and it is great fun. For a detailed review from a mathematician's perspective, see Robert Osserman's article. See also the musical's webpage, hosted by the Clay Institute.

The original title of the musical was _Proof_. It was changed after David Auburn's play of the same title, about a mathematics professor and his daughter, became a hit. The following remarks are by Lessner:

"When we started working on _Fermat's Last Tango_ in December 1996, we had no idea that it would eventually be perceived as part of an unprecedented trend of stage works about math and science. We were tremendously excited to see, last season, the success of _Copenhagen_ and _Proof_ , among others, and we, along with [York artistic director] Jim Morgan realized that the time for a musical that takes math as its milieu was now or never.

"It's about obsession, a real-life quest that lasted 30 years, the fruit of which yielded the single most extraordinary contribution to modern mathematics. It's _Rocky_ , _Don Quixote_ , even _The Fantasticks_ —boy gets proof, boy loses proof, boy gets proof. We knew going in that the subject matter could be potentially forbidding, so we focused on keeping the piece accessible and, above all, fun.

"Josh had long toyed with the idea of writing a 'catchy' opera, and it turned out that the tuneful and rhythmic elements of our show superseded the fact that it was through-sung and had some classical influences. By the middle of the process it became clear that _Fermat's Last Tango_ was a musical, not an opera; in addition to the tango, there are several recognizable dance forms. There's a rag, a grand waltz, and even a hoedown for the four luminaries [ _Pythagoras, Euclid, Newton, and Gauss_ ] who populate the AfterMath. I like to call them the 'singing and dancing dead mathematicians.' Our director, Mel Marvin, likens them to characters out of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ —so serious and full of themselves that they are incongruously funny."

### **Chapter 15**  
 **Survival in the Fourth Dimension**

In _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer3," Homer is seeking to hide from Marge's sisters and discovers a portal to the third dimension. Rather than face the sisters, he takes his chances in the mystery world, and gets trapped.

_LISA: So where's my dad?_

_PROFESSOR FRINK: Well, it should be obvious to the most dimwitted individual who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology, m'hey, that Homer Simpson has stumbled into_ [lights go off] _the third dimension!  
LISA_ [switches the light back on]: _Sorry_.

_FRINK: Here is an ordinary square_.

**Fig. 15.1** Explaining the Frinkahedron.

_CHIEF WIGGUM: Whoa, whoa. Slow down, egghead_.

_FRINK: But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe along the hypothetical z-axis, there_.

_EVERYONE: Gasp!_

_FRINK: This forms a three-dimensional object known as a "cube," or a "Frinkahedron," named in honor of its discoverer. M'hey, m'hey_.

_HOMER: Help me! Are you helping me, or are you just going on and on? FRINK: Oh, right. And, of course, within we find the doomed individual_.

Of course, the two-dimensional Homer is totally unprepared to meet the challenges of a three-dimensional world. Similarly, we suspect that most of our three-dimensional readers would be very lost if suddenly thrown into a four-dimensional world. With this in mind, and to alleviate the great concern created by this ever-present danger, we offer here our survival guide to the fourth dimension.

#### **15.1 Time, Space, Both, or What?**

In the _Devil Girl From Mars_ (1954), the devil girl Nyah is describing the ultimate weapon:

0:28

_NYAH: As fast as matter was created, it was changed by its molecular structure into the next dimension, and so destroyed itself.  
PROFESSOR HENNESSEY: So there_ is _a fourth dimension!_

The Professor seemed very convinced by Nyah, though we're not sure why. Indeed, ever since Einstein, "the fourth dimension" has been a hugely popular topic of discussion, but seldom accompanied by much understanding. As part of Einstein's theory of relativity, the three spatial dimensions are woven together with time to create a four-dimensional space-time universe, a beautiful and mysterious concept. It's also not at all what we wish to discuss.

For mathematicians, the fourth dimension is (usually) different, and it was a mathematical reality at least fifty years prior to Einstein's space-time ingenuity. To describe it, we first note that the position of a point in everyday three-dimensional space (our three-dimensional Euclidean space) is determined by its three coordinates ( _x, y, z_ ). Analogously, a point in four-dimensional space is pinned down by four coordinates ( _x, y, z, w_ ). And if you want more dimensions, it's easy: for example, a point in seven-dimensional space is simply pinned down by seven coordinates ( _x, y, z, w, p, q, r_ ).

Now, what all these dimensions _mean_ is a matter of context and of debate. However, the _mathematics_ of higher dimensions is quite easy. These mathematical worlds are not fundamentally different from our three-dimensional world, and they can be played with and analyzed in very similar and familiar ways. Our goal is to describe how, using movie math as our platform.

What then has all this to do with time being the fourth dimension? Not a whole lot. In relativity, there are also four dimensions, pinned down by the four coordinates ( _x, y, z, t_ ). However, whereas in our four-dimensional world all the dimensions are alike, this is definitely not the case for space-time: the time dimension is fundamentally different from the space dimensions. For example, we can easily move back and forth in space, whereas moving back in time requires the purchase of a time machine. In the following, we'll focus on a fourth spatial dimension, steering clear of the special and trickier concept of time as the fourth dimension.

#### **15.2 The Hypercube Via Analogy**

The movie _Cube 2: Hypercube_ (2002) is the sequel to _Cube_ (1997); see chapter 6 ("Escape from the Cube"). As in _Cube_ , some lucky people wake up in a very hostile world. This world consists of cubical rooms, interconnected by doors in the walls, ceilings, and floors (figure 15.2).

As the people stumble from room to room, very strange things happen: rooms loop in on themselves; rooms that were adjacent cease to be so; time (there we go!) moves differently in different rooms; and gravity acts in different directions in different rooms. Amidst it all, the lucky people have to be on the lookout for deadly traps.

The main characters are psychologist Kate Filmore, private investigator Simon Grady, computer game programmer Max Reisler, engineer Jerry Whitehall, and the old, senile, and incredibly annoying mathematician, Mrs. Paley.

**Fig. 15.2** One of the cubical rooms in _Cube 2_.

0:25  
 _MRS. PALEY: It's a tesseract.  
JERRY: Christ, she's losing it_.

_MRS. PALEY: Isn't it beautiful?_

_KATE: Isn't what beautiful, Mrs. Paley?_  
[Mrs. Paley points at a diagram on the floor.]

_JERRY: Holy Shit! If you look at it from just the right angle—What did you call it again Mrs. Paley?_

_MRS. PALEY: It's a tesseract, sweetheart_.

_JERRY: Tesseract?—Tesseract. It's a tesseract!—A tesseract, it's another name for a hypercube—a four-dimensional cube. All the elements are there. I mean, rooms repeating, rooms folding in on themselves. Teleportation. It could all very well add up_.

_Look. Here. See?_ He begins a Frink-style explanation.] _Let's call one dimension length and represent that with a simple line. Now, two dimensions are length and width, which is represented by a simple square. If we extend this by one more dimension we get a cube, which has three dimensions: length, width, and depth_. [[Figure 15.3]

**Fig. 15.3** Growing a cube.

_JERRY: Here's the really funky part. If you take this cube and we extend it one more dimension, we get..._

_KATE: A tesseract_.

_MAX: I thought time was considered to be the fourth dimension_. [No, no, no!]  
 _JERRY: Sure that is one idea. But what if you have a fourth spatial dimension?_

Jerry's Frink-style lecture is a very accurate description of how to construct a four-dimensional cube, what mathematicians refer to as a _tesseract_ or _hypercube_. Jerry uses the familiar counterparts in three dimensions to motivate the four-dimensional analogy. Such analogizing is one of the most powerful tools for creating and understanding four-dimensional objects.

Furthermore, the process can be continued to construct a five-dimensional cube, and then a six-dimensional cube, and so on. Also, since a line segment and a square are the first two objects in the process of growing cubes, mathematicians sometimes refer to a line segment as a "one-dimensional cube" and to a square as a "two-dimensional cube." In fact, at times they even refer to a "zero-dimensional cube," which is just a point.

#### **15.3 Picturing the Hypercube**

As an application of Jerry's interdimensional analogy, let's see how to visualize higher-dimensional cubes. The first two diagrams of figure 15.3 really are one-dimensional and two-dimensional cubes. However, the third diagram is not actually a three-dimensional cube (unless you've purchased the special hologram edition of this book). Rather, it is a _picture_ of such a cube. To make this picture, we first draw a square and then a copy of the square, translated a little in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Corresponding corners of the squares are then connected (figure 15.4).

**Fig. 15.4** Growing a cube by doubling a square.

This is the same doubling process that produces a square from a line segment, and a line from a single point, suggesting that we can use the same technique to draw a tesseract. Take a picture of the cube and make a new, translated copy. Then connect corresponding corners of the cubes by edges. This results in the picture of a tesseract; see figure 15.5. Continuing in this manner, we can produce flat pictures of cubes of any dimension.

**Fig. 15.5** Growing a hypercube by doubling a cube.

The word "HYPERCUBE" is grown in the opening titles of the movie _Cube 2_ ; see figure 15.6. Very nicely, the method by which the word grows is based upon the above method for growing cubes. The creation of this title sequence is discussed in the DVD extra, "Making of _Cube 2: Hypercube_."

**Fig. 15.6** Growing the title of the movie.

Jerry guesses that he and the others are trapped in a four-dimensional cube. He could easily have saved them a lot of trouble, if he had gone further and deduced some of the basic properties of the hypercube.

##### **How Many Rooms?**

A one-dimensional cube is bounded by two zero-dimensional cubes: without the jargon, a line segment has two endpoints. Next, a two-dimensional cube is bounded by four one-dimensional cubes (that is, a square has four sides). Then, a three-dimensional cube is bounded by six two-dimensional cubes (that is, a cube has six square faces). If we trust in patterns, this suggests that a four-dimensional cube should be bounded by eight regular cubes. That is indeed the case. We highlight the eight cubical rooms in figure 15.7.

This also suggests that the hypercube world in which Jerry and the others are trapped consists of only eight rooms. These eight cubical rooms are stuck together face to face in the fourth dimension, to form the "surface" of a four-dimensional cube.

This is an important and subtle point! When we speak about a "cube," we may mean a solid cube, for example, a die. However "cube" may also refer to a hollow cube, such as a box. The solid cube is genuinely three-dimensional, whereas the hollow cube is a two-dimensional surface within three-dimensional space.

When Jerry speaks of a hypercube, he actually means a hollow rather than a solid hypercube. This hollow hypercube is actually three-dimensional, though it is the "surface" of a solid, genuinely four-dimensional hypercube. This may well boggle the mind, but just relax and trust in what the analogies suggest.

**Fig. 15.7** A hypercube is bounded by eight cubes.

Our picture of the hypercube also shows its corners and edges, and we can see it has 16 corners. Of course, we could easily have guessed this, from the doubling process, and since the lower-dimensional cubes have 1, 2, 4, and 8 corners.

0:29

They find a number on the ceiling.

_JERRY: 60,659 rooms, Christ_.

_KATE: This place must be huge_.

_MRS. PALEY: Oh yes, yes—in a hypercube, there could be 60 million rooms.  
JERRY: She could be right_.

Jerry really should know better.

##### **No Way Out!**

0:18

_JERRY: There's got to be some kind of logic to it. These rooms just seem to repeat. You go in one direction the room just loops back on itself_.

Again, by analogy, it is possible to figure out why these cubical worlds should loop in on themselves. For the moment, imagine the victims are one-dimensional beings caught in the edge of a hollow two-dimensional cube. That is, our victims are trapped in the perimeter of a square.

The perimeter of a square is a loop. So, moving in one direction, the one-dimensional beings will pass through the four "rooms" and loop back to where they began. Exactly the same is true for two-dimensional creatures trapped in the surface of a cube; walking in one direction, the creatures will return to their starting square after having passed through three other squares (figure 15.8).

**Fig. 15.8** Moving in one direction through four rooms gets you back to where you started.

This looping occurs in two- and three-dimensional cubes, and so by analogy it should be a feature of hypercubes as well. And it is. Moving in one direction, Jerry and the others will return to where they began after traversing a total of four rooms. Such a round trip is highlighted in figure 15.9.

**Fig. 15.9** A loop of four cubes, joined along the highlighted squares.

Finally, notice that a hollow cube has no trapdoors offering escape to an outside world. Leaving one room always just leads to winding up in another. So Jerry and the others really are in trouble.

##### **The Schlegel Diagram**

Figure 15.10 shows the diagram of the tesseract recognized by the annoying (but knowledgeable) Mrs. Paley. It is clearly a very different picture of the hypercube, and arises from a different inter-dimensional analogy.

**Fig. 15.10** Mrs. Paley's tesseract.

Take a wire frame model of a three-dimensional cube and project it onto a screen. In the resulting shadow, all the corners and edges of the cube are visible. However, some of the faces are somewhat distorted and no longer appear as squares.

Figure 15.11 shows a particularly nice shadow of a cube, known as a _Schlegel projection_ of the cube. There is apparently a face missing, but the outer square corresponds to this missing face.

**Fig. 15.11** A Schlegel projection of the cube.

We may be lacking a four-dimensional lightbulb, but mathematically there is no difficulty in casting a similar shadow of a wire frame hypercube onto a "three-dimensional screen." This shadow will be a three-dimensional wire frame, a Schlegel projection of the hypercube. Figure 15.10 is a two-dimensional picture of this Schlegel projection, which is what Mrs. Paley discovered. Looked at carefully, the Schlegel diagram exhibits seven distorted rooms. The eighth room has to be represented there somehow, and it is: it corresponds to the outside cube.

This shadow of the hypercube makes a charming reappearance later on in the movie. It is one of the incarnations of the so-called razor sphere, a booby trap that shreds poor Jerry to pieces.

The hypercube mathematics above explains some of the strange phenomena experienced by the group. However, the mathematical aspects are only marginally developed in the movie, and distracting bits and pieces commonly associated with the fourth dimension get mixed into the story. For example, time seems to pass at different speeds in different rooms. Much of the pseudo-science that was supposed to explain what else was going on in the Hypercube is described in the DVD extra, "Making of _Cube 2: Hypercube_."

There is a final piece of very nice mathematics in _Cube 2_. Toward the end, all the rooms collapse onto a single room, of which the opposite sides are identified. So leaving the room through one of the doors results in reentering it through the door in the opposite wall (figure 15.12). This new, strange place is also a famous three-dimensional world, known as the _3-torus_.

**Fig. 15.12** The last two survivors of _Cube 2_ , in the collapsed hypercube (3-torus).

One of the nicest animations of growing higher-dimensional cubes appears in _Supernova_ (2004). A point is expanded into a line, then the line into a square, then the square into a cube, then the cube into the Schlegel projection of a hypercube (figure 15.13), then... oh well... The animations do cheat a little bit with the higher-dimensional pictures, but it is still pretty cool:

**Fig. 15.13** Constructing the picture of a higher-dimensional cube.

#### **15.4 Dimension Drive**

The movie _Supernova_ also features a "dimension drive," enabling a spaceship to cover vast distances in no time. Does this make any sense? It does! Well, at least mathematically.

Imagine you're a two-dimensional being and trapped in a spherical world, and you want to travel from the North Pole to the South Pole. You are restricted to traveling within your two-dimensional world, along the spherical surface. However, if you have purchased a Dimension Drive (patent pending), you can travel through the surrounding three-dimensional space, taking the considerably shorter straight-line route.

Analogously, imagine that the three-dimensional universe we live in is situated inside a higher-dimensional universe. Then two points that are light-years apart within our world may actually be only centimeters apart when one travels through the higher-dimensional space. If so, a dimension drive would permit faster-than-light travel.

A similar mode of zippy transport is featured in _Event Horizon_ (1997). Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) attempts to explain it to the members of a rescue mission:

14:30

_DR WEIR: The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight_.

_SMITH: Uh, excuse me. See, you can't actually do that_.

_STARK: The law of relativity prohibits faster-than-light travel_.

_DR WEIR: Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really go faster than light. What it does is it_ _creates a dimensional gateway that allows it to jump instantaneously from one point of the Universe to another light-years away_.

_STARK: How?_

_DR WEIR: Well, that's difficult to—it's all math_.

_MILLER: Try us, Doctor_.

_DR WEIR: Right. Well, uh, using layman's terms, we use a retaining magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons. These, in turn, fold space-time, consistent with Weil tensor dynamics until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity. Now, the singularity_...

_MILLER: Layman's terms_.

_COOPER: Well, fuck layman's terms. Do you speak English?_

_DR WEIR: Imagine for a minute that this piece of paper... represents space-time, and you want to get from point A here to point B there_. [He marks two points on the paper by punching holes.] _Now, what's the shortest distance between two points?_

_JUSTIN: A straight line_.

**Fig. 15.14** By folding a piece of paper any two points can be made to coincide.

_DR WEIR: Wrong. The shortest distance between two points is zero, and that's what the gateway does. It folds space so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time_. He folds the piece of paper such that the two holes in the paper are superimposed ([figure 15.14).] _When the spacecraft passes through the gateway, space returns to normal_. [He passes a pencil through the holes and unfolds the piece of paper.]

Using a dimension drive would allow a spaceship to vanish at one point of the Universe and to reappear at another: definitely handy for avoiding that peak-hour traffic. In fact, a great many miracles, such as having objects vanish and unlinking solid rings, can easily be explained (at least in movie worlds) using higher dimensions. For example, the razor sphere in _Cube 2_ makes its appearance in this manner. However, this is a miracle Jerry could have done without.

#### **15.5 Intersections**

In _Shrieker_ (1997), we meet some monsters that turn out to be intersections of higher-dimensional beings with our three-dimensional world. The hero is Clark, a math student interested in higher dimensions:

0:38

_ZAK: So, what are you working on?_

_CLARK: This? Oh, actually it's multidimensional topography._

_ZAK: Please don't..._

Zak is already lost, or bored, or both. (Perhaps Clark describing her work as "topography" rather than _topology_ has confused him.) It's a shame, as Clark was all ready to describe the intersection of a four-dimensional object with our three-dimensional world. This information would have made Zak much more useful when the monsters attacked.

Imagine that your friend is a two-dimensional being, living in a plane, and you want to give him a sense of what a cube is. You can show him the cube a slice at a time, by passing the cube through his plane; see figure 15.15.

**Fig. 15.15** A cube passes corner-first through a plane.

Suppose the cube is lowered down corner first. When this corner first touches the plane, a point is visible, and then an equilateral triangle grows. As the triangle grows further, its corners become chopped off, until eventually the plane contains a perfect regular hexagon. Then everything is repeated in reverse, until the cube disappears (figure 15.16).

**Fig. 15.16** The intersections of a cube as it passes through a plane.

Now imagine a hypercube passing through our three-dimensional world, corner-first. Initially we see a point, and then a growing tetrahedron. As the tetrahedron grows further, its corners become chopped off, until eventually we see an octahedron. Then everything is repeated in reverse, until the hypercube disappears (figure 15.17).

**Fig. 15.17** A hypercube passes corner first through our world.

Returning to _Shrieker_ , Clark explains her deciphering of some mysterious symbols:

0:39

_CLARK: Okay, I've been looking over your notes and you're completely wrong_.

_ROBERT: Well, that's progress at least. Why am I wrong?_

_CLARK: You've been treating these symbols as if they were mathematical terms, but they're not_.

_ROBERT: Then what are they?_

_CLARK: They're cross-sections. See, the even symbols are two-dimensional cross-sections of a three-dimensional shape. The odd symbols find the angle of the cross-section..._

_ROBERT: This is what I think. There are higher dimensions and things live in them. Sometimes there are weak spots between the higher ones and our own where they can break through. And I think sometimes these breakthroughs must happen spontaneously, not often, but there have been other cases._

_CLARK: Like lightning?_

_ROBERT: That's right_.

Well, it is a cheap horror movie. In any case, Clark and Robert now have a sense of what kind of monster they're dealing with. Later, Clark explains to David (who is horror-movie cannon fodder) how one of the shriekers has overtaken them:

0:53

_CLARK: It's a three-dimensional cross-section. So it can move instantly from one place to the next, even move through walls_.

_DAVID: That's fuckin' great!_

Clark's explanation actually makes sense. To see the idea in a simpler context, imagine a tentacled two-dimensional monster passing through a one-dimensional world. As indicated by figure 15.18, the monster's tentacles can simultaneously pass through different locations of a one-dimensional world. Presumably, Clark's four-dimensional shrieker is performing the same trick.

**Fig. 15.18** A two-dimensional monster can simultaneously be at different places in a one-dimensional world.

Those familiar with Edwin Abbott's classic novel _Flatland_ will immediately recognize the cross-section approach to visualizing higher dimensions. In Abbott's story, a three-dimensional sphere visits a two-dimensional world by passing through. As it does so, a square in the two-dimensional world observes its different cross-sections. First, a point materializes out of nowhere. This point then turns into a circle, which first expands and then shrinks back to a point.

We are aware of four movies based on Abbott's novel, of which our favorite is _Flatland: The Movie_ (2007). Also charming is the claymation film _Flatlandia_ (1982), made by mathematician and film maker Michele Emmer.

#### **15.6 The Hypersphere**

In _Insignificance_ (1985), Marilyn Monroe visits Albert Einstein to discuss the theory of relativity. Her husband, baseball player Joe DiMaggio, who likes round things, barges in on the discussion. He suspects the worst...

56:18

_MARILYN: What is the shape of the Universe?_

_EINSTEIN: It's not important. You've got things to discuss_.

_DIMAGGIO: God dammit, you tell her the shape of the friggin' Universe! I want to take her home. Tell her!_

_MARILYN: Please_.

_DIMAGGIO: Tell her!_

_EINSTEIN: Well, the shape of the Universe is difficult to describe. If I were to explain it, it would come out as abstract symbols, but I'll tell you how to imagine it. Imagine a dot so small that it has zero dimensions. You extend the dot into a one-dimensional line. You turn around the line, and you've got a two-dimensional circle. And you flip the circle and you've got a three-dimensional sphere. And you got that sphere, and you turn it into the fourth dimension, and you got the shape of the Universe, but..._ [Figure 15.19]

**Fig. 15.19** Building higher-dimensional spheres from lower-dimensional spheres.

_EINSTEIN: I know. I know now exactly how you can imagine it. Take a completely solid object, a completely solid object and twist it inside out indefinitely forever and that's the shape of the Universe_.

_MARILYN: Wow!_

_DIMAGGIO: Bullshit! I tell you what I think it is. I think it's round like everything else in nature. Like flowers, like the moon and the sun. It's all based on a circle. You know that? Like the world. I don't know what you two geniuses think the shape of the world is, but me and Columbus happen to think it's round. It's a damn lucky thing for the United States, too. For if it wasn't for Columbus we'd all be Indians. What do you think about that?_

The real Albert Einstein believed that our Universe is a hollow hypersphere, that is, the higher-dimensional counterpart of a hollow sphere. The movie Einstein provides a method for visualizing a _solid_ four-dimensional hypersphere (whose surface is the hollow three-dimensional hypersphere).

Although the movie people didn't get it quite right, we'll give them 7 out of 10 for getting close, plus an extra point for having it all inspired by Marilyn Monroe.

Einstein's second attempt to explain things to Marilyn doesn't mean much at all. However, notice that DiMaggio's and Einstein's preferred shapes are really the same thing, just in two different dimensions.

Even more memorable than the above shape-of-the-universe scene, _Insignificance_ contains an absolutely marvelous scene in which Marilyn Monroe explains the special theory of relativity to Einstein using flashlights and toy trains. Bringing us back to Einstein's four-dimensional space-time universe, that other mathematical story...

### **Chapter 16  
To Infinity, and Beyond!**

So exclaims Buzz Lightyear in the _Toy Story_ movies. However, Buzz is referring to his willingness to travel to the ends of the Universe in order to save his pal Woody. He is unlikely to be as gung ho in the realm of mathematical infinities.

It is the same with most movies. The concept of infinity is very emotive, a powerful metaphor for our physical and psychological smallness. It is understandable that almost all movies that refer to it do so in the manner of _Toy Story_ , as an unexplained symbol of our tinyness, or of the vastness of our efforts and concerns. Since, then, the very purpose of referring to "infinity" is to suggest incomprehensible magnitude, it is neither a surprise nor a failing that these movies offer little true understanding.

In _Brain Dead_ (1990), for example, the evil Eunice Corporation is attempting to gain the secrets lost in the brain of the mathematician Dr. Halsey. Eunice's logo is the ubiquitous symbol for infinity (figure 16.1), but the symbol here is merely a symbol.

**Fig. 16.1** Infinity as a logo.

Such unexplained references to the seemingly inexplicable can be both fun and artistically effective. Mathematicians, however, have a peculiar habit of confronting the incomprehensible and making it do their bidding. So it is with infinity, which has been transformed from a terrifying monster in the mathematical jungles to the most powerful tool in modern mathematics.

Some movies actually do touch upon truly mathematical notions of infinity, usually flippantly, sometimes hilariously, and just occasionally with cleverness and true understanding. Our intention here is to survey these attempts, suitably laughing and applauding as we go. In the process, in explaining how the movies get it right and wrong, we shall attempt to give some sense of just how mathematicians think of infinity, how they tamed the monster.

#### **16.1 Mystical Musings**

At the outset let's be clear that, though mathematicians may explicitly _define_ infinity (and indeed they do, in various ways), this does not mean that they are completely comfortable with the concept. This is elegantly expressed by Don Pedro Valesquez in the _The Saragossa Manuscript_ (1965):

2:25

_DON PEDRO: I will tell you something that is based on the principles of geometry. Wanting to define an infinite number, I write a horizontal eight and divide it by one. If I want to express infinite smallness, I write a one and divide it by the horizontal eight_.

_All these signs give me no idea about what I want to express: infinity—greatness. In the cosmos, infinite smallness is an infinite root of the smallest part of an atom. So I am defining infinity, but without comprehending. Well, if I do not comprehend but I can define it, I am getting near poetry, which seems to be nearer to life than we suspect_.

Don Pedro's reference to geometry is somewhat peculiar, but he is correct in two ways. First, to simply write the symbol for infinity explains nothing. _The Bank_ (2001), for example, is a mathematically rich movie, but the use of the symbol _∞_ at the end of the movie, indicating the bank's demise (figure 16.2), is simply a metaphor hiding amid the mathematics. Second, mathematicians _can_ still define and use infinity, even if without full comprehension, and this process is both powerful and poetic.

#### **16.2 Toward Infinity, but Getting Lost**

Don Pedro stays safely in the realm of poetry, but things tend to get messier when a movie attempts to deal with infinity more concretely. Of course, the appearances of infinity in _Brain Dead_ and _The Bank_ are quite innocent, simply catchy illustrations possessing no deeper meaning. The same cannot be said for the following exchange in _Alien Hunter_ (2003), in which, sad to say, Julian (James Spader) is our hero:

**Fig. 16.2** An infinity sign signaling doom in _The Bank_.

_1:16_

_KATE: You know how unlikely that is.  
JULIAN: How unlikely? What are the odds?  
SHELLEY: 99.999 to the infinite_.

_JULIAN: But not 100_.

#### **16.3 Toward Infinity, and Almost Getting There**

The above scene from _Alien Hunter_ contains some pseudomathematics, but there is no genuine attempt to deal with infinity. To do so, clearly one must carefully consider exactly what "infinity" means.

The simplest approach to mathematical infinity, the notion of an _infinite process_ , arises in _Forbidden Planet_ (1956). At one point, Dr. Morbius is explaining to Lieutenant Ostrow and Commander Adams the amount of energy the Krell aliens were able to produce (figure 16.3):

0:58

_MORBIUS: May I draw your attention to these gauges all around here, gentlemen. Their calibrations seem to indicate that they are set in decimal series, each division recording exactly 10 times as many Amperes as the one preceding it. Ten times ten times ten times ten, on and on and on, row after row, gauge after gauge. But, there is no direct wiring that I can discover. However, when I activate this machine it registers infinitesimally, you see down there in the lower left-hand corner. And, then, when I activate the educator here, it registers a little bit more_.

_OSTROW: But this much is negligible, the total potential here must be nothing less than astronomical!_

_MORBIUS: Nothing less. The number ten raised almost literally to the power of infinity_.

**Fig. 16.3** Dr. Morbius in _Forbidden Planet_.

Here we have the idea of unbounded growth, multiplying by ten with each gauge, creating the sequence

101, 102, 103,...

Of course, the Krell have a definitively _finite_ planet, the sequence of meters must eventually end, and Dr. Morbius's suggestion of "almost literally" reaching infinity can make no real sense. Nonetheless, the meters give a sense of _potential infinity_ , the idea of unbounded growth, that we can _imagine_ the meters going on forever. This parallels the growth of the natural numbers and is _exactly_ what we mean by saying there are infinitely many of them.

#### **16.4 Toward the Infinitely Small: Romantic Zeno**

This idea of infinity as a process can be considered in exactly the same manner for the infinitely small. For a romantic view of this, we turn to _I.Q_. (1994), where Catherine (Meg Ryan) is explaining one of Zeno's paradoxes to Ed (Tim Robbins) (figure 16.4):

0:49

_CATHERINE: You can't get from there to here because you always have to cover half the remaining distance_ (figure 16.4). _Like from me to you, I have to cover half of it. But see I still have half of that remaining—so I cover half that—And there is still half of that left, so I cover half of that—and half of that, and half of that, and half of that. And since there are infinite halves left, I can't ever get there_.

Ed then remarks that Catherine has nonetheless reached him. And, undeniably together, they dance.

**Fig. 16.4** And half of that...

#### **16.5 To Infinity: Are We There Yet?**

But what about _actually_ getting there? The idea in the previous scenes is not that any one number is of infinite extent, but of the process, the potential to grow larger (or smaller) without bound. But to actually get there?

This is the notion of _completed infinity_ , of somehow capturing the totality of the process. In Catherine's case, this would amount to not simply being as close as desired to the desirable Ed, but to being in the exact same spot. In the case of Dr. Morbius, we would have to somehow deal with _∞_ as a number, as in itself a possible magnitude.

Mathematicians do indeed treat _∞_ as a number, including performing (careful!) arithmetic with it, but this notion is not well known or understood outside of the mathematical world. Nonetheless, the idea of _∞_ as a number is quickly and humorously but accurately referred to in _Bill_ & _Ted's Bogus_ _Journey_ (1991). Bill and Ted wind up in Hell and are confronted by Colonel Oats, ordering them to do push-ups:

0:39

_OATS: Now get down and give me—infinity!_

_BILL: Dude, there's no way I can do infinity push-ups.  
TED: Maybe if he lets us do 'em girlie style_.

#### **16.6 Fishing with a Really Big Net**

An alternative aspect of the infinity of the natural numbers is to simply gather them all up and to regard them together as a collection, what mathematicians refer to as a _set_. This is perhaps a more familiar notion than that of _∞_ as a number, but the mathematics of infinite sets quickly takes on a paradoxical air. This is introduced very nicely in _Infinity_ (1996), the biopic about the physicist Richard Feynman. In one scene, Feynman is using infinity to capture young Henry's imagination:

1:47

_FEYNMAN: Hey Henry. Did you know that there are twice as many numbers as numbers?_

_HENRY: Oh, come on, Dick!_

_FEYNMAN: There are. Let me show you. Name a number_.

_HENRY: One million_.

_FEYNMAN: Two million_.

_HENRY: Twenty-seven_.

_FEYNMAN: Fifty-four. Now you try it. Six_.

_HENRY: Twelve!_

_FEYNMAN: Six million_.

_HENRY: Twelve million!_

_FEYNMAN: Light beginning to dawn?_

Feynman is suggesting a particular _correspondence_ between natural numbers, each number being associated with its double.

**Fig. 16.5** There are as many even numbers as numbers.

What can we see from this? Most simply, as Feynman goes on to remark, the correspondence demonstrates that there is no largest number, since the double will always be larger. But Feynman's original suggestion is that we can see something much more intriguing, that there are twice as many numbers as numbers. How can we make sense of this?

Feynman's correspondence makes clear that _there are exactly as many even numbers as natural numbers:_ the pairing shows that the second row in figure 16.5 has exactly as many things in it as the first row. This is already peculiar, but we can go further.

We can just as easily see that there are exactly as many _odd_ numbers as numbers (pairing 1 ↔ 1, 2 ↔ 3, 3 ↔ 5, and so on). Then, since the collection of natural numbers is exactly the collections of even and odd numbers combined, there are twice as many numbers as numbers, just as Feynman promised.

Does this make any sense? Perhaps surprisingly, it does; one simply has to accept that the mathematics of infinite collections behaves differently, with an inevitably paradoxical feeling to it. We already stumbled across this in _The Mirror Has Two Faces_ (1996), when the mathematician Greg Larkin confronts his student:

1:45

_GREG: Don't you know that it is possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still have an infinite number of elements left over?_

Greg is thinking of prime numbers, but in terms of our setting, an example would be to remove the infinitely many even numbers, leaving behind the infinitely many odd numbers. Unfortunately, in _Infinity_ , Feynman cops out by making his much simpler and less controversial observation, never returning to his initial teaser.

The fascinating mathematics of infinite correspondences was cleverly described a century ago by mathematician David Hilbert. Hilbert imagined a hotel with infinitely many rooms and infinitely many guests. He then considered various mathematical correspondences by imagining new guests arriving at the hotel and having them accommodated by shuffling around the original guests. Hilbert's playful approach to infinity was brilliantly brought to life in the stunning education film _Hotel Hilbert_ (1996).

#### **16.7 Infinity Pays Its Way**

Much more than a beautiful concept, infinity is an actively used tool in modern mathematics. Again, there are movies that give some indication of this, but we shall begin with the silly. In _Las Vegas Weekend_ (1986), the "math wizard" Percy Doolittle is describing his theories to his new gambling partners:

0:21

_PERCY: You see, my work involves a new system of mathematics, the mathematics of infinity, a place where time and space stand still. And they don't stand still so much as they merge into one piece of time—space.—So I calculate what happens out there in that random space, infinity, and it's funny but it's very much like predicting gambling and what cards are coming up next. Because it is after all the same phenomenon, random events_.

This is "completely gobbledegooky," as Percy's PhD supervisor aptly summarizes, although it sits well enough in a dumb comedy about gambling. A more serious movie with a more serious, if not completely successful, approach to mathematics is _Moebius_ (1996). The story involves a subway train which has somehow disappeared without trace from the network. Daniel Pratt is a mathematician brought in to consider the event:

0:49

_DANIEL: I'm not sure but I think it has integrated the whole system at such a high level that I don't even know how to calculate it. I suppose it's become infinite. If I'm right, gentlemen, we can conclude that the system is working like a Möbius band_.

_Moebius_ contains many such remarks upon the newly infinite nature of the subway network. However, even accepting the fantasy world of this movie—and the idea that an introduced Möbius band might muck up the connectivity of the subway network is impossible but delightful—the remarks about infinity make no sense.

The Möbius band is fascinating due to its one-sidedness, and its peculiar characteristics are often emphasized by drawing the Möbius band in the shape of _∞_ , as did the Eunice corporation in _Brain Dead_ (figure 16.1), and as is indicated in the titles of _Moebius_ (figure 16.6). But there is nothing especially "infinite" about it. True, one can travel forever on a Möbius band, making loop after loop, but exactly the same can be said for a circle or a cylinder.

**Fig. 16.6** An _∞_ -shaped Möbius strip in the titles of _Moebius_.

Even those movies that explicitly deal with mathematics usually spend little time on the specific notions and applications of infinity. _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001), for example, treats some higher mathematics with clarity and intelligence, and infinity is implicit in much of this. However, the only explicit appearance of infinity is an unexplained infinite sum in John Nash's window doodlings, and an infinity formed by the path of Nash's bicycle (figure 16.7).

**Fig. 16.7** John Nash rides to _∞_ in _A Beautiful Mind_.

_The Bank_ (2001) offers a little more (figure 16.8). When the mathematician Jim Doyle employs dynamical systems in an attempt to master the stock market, he indicates what he needs to succeed:

0:10

_JIM: This mathematics allows us to predict almost anything. If we can predict this_ [he draws an _∞_ ], _then predicting the stock market is easy_.

Similar is Professor Benson in _Battle of the Worlds_ (1961), explaining how he noticed the outsider, a moonlike object heading straight for Earth:

**Fig. 16.8** Encountering infinity in _The Bank_.

0:10

_PROFESSOR BENSON: You and the others have to see and hear before you can know. I have one advantage over all of you: calculus.—Oh, so you didn't see it until just before dawn. And didn't anyone of you notice the change of position of the two outer planets?—Infinitesimal! It merely heralded the arrival of the outsider_.

#### **16.8 Pretty Patterns, Pretty Pi**

Professor Benson declares the power of the concept of infinity through the power of the calculus but, as for all the above scenes, he suggests such power while providing no detail whatsoever. This is hardly surprising: the beauty and appeal of higher mathematics are anything but easy to convey, and the movie-going public is hardly primed to receive such material. So even a mathematically ambitious movie-maker is advised to employ more familiar, more accessible and more visually appealing material.

_π_ (1998), as we saw in chapter 4, is one movie that does so. This movie treats mathematical concepts, and infinity in particular, with thought and integrity. This is made clear in the very first scene, where mathematician Max Cohen calculates   rhythmically reciting the decimal expansion as he disappears down the stairwell. The vision of Max descending as his voice trails off gives a vivid picture of the infinite decimal expansion of

Of course, though this representation of   is infinite, the fraction is not itself an infinite creature. The same cannot be said for _π_ , the movie's central, irrational, character: the opening titles show _π_ superimposed upon the beginning of its decimal expansion.

**Fig. 16.9**

This raises an interesting issue about dots and the representation of infinite processes. If we write   we know exactly what the dots mean: just keep repeating the "18" forever. However, if we write _π_ = 3.141592... , it is not at all clear what the dots mean, what is meant to come next other than "what works." It is this very mystery, the seeming patternlessness in the infinite decimal expansion of _π_ , which is at the heart of the movie, Max's search for patterns in this apparent randomness.

Of course, there are other, more natural ways to view _π_. At one point we hear Max's thoughts, as he considers his old professor Sol. He contrasts the geometric simplicity of _π_ with the complexity and mystery of its decimal expansion.

0:12

_MAX: We see the simplicity of the circle, we see the maddening complexity of the endless string of numbers, three point one four, off to infinity_.

As Max says this, he writes the decimal expansion of _π_ , together with the familiar equations for the area and circumference of a circle (figure 16.10). It is these very natural geometric ideas that explain why we even bother with _π_ ; they contain a simplicity and beauty much less likely to drive Max crazy. Indeed, the infinite nature of _π_ has seemingly disappeared altogether.

However, the discerning eye can still spot infinity, peeking from underneath this geometric cloak of simplicity; the question is, how does one _define_ the area (similarly, the circumference) of a circle? Certainly nothing as simple as "length times width," as we declare for a rectangle, will work. But, in the end, area can really be nothing more than "length times width" used in more and more complicated settings. Pondering this, one is inevitably led to the idea of the circle itself as a completed infinity, as an infinite-sided polygon (figure 16.11).

**Fig. 16.10** _π_ = 3.14159265...

**Fig. 16.11** A circle as a limit of a sequence of regular polygons.

And so, infinity reappears in _π_ , albeit in a much more beautiful and natural form than that of the decimal expansion.

#### **16.9 Golden Infinity**

Infinity makes a last, lovely appearance in _π_ , when Max draws and describes a _golden rectangle_. As Max indicates, a golden rectangle is a rectangle from which a square can be removed, to leave a rectangle of the same proportions. There is nothing glaringly "infinite" about this construction, but Max notes that this process of "squaring" can be repeated, over and over, creating an infinite nested sequence of golden rectangles (figure 16.12).

**Fig. 16.12** Constructing smaller and smaller golden rectangles.

On the other hand, this possibility is hardly unique to the golden rectangle. In _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ (1959), for instance, there appears a beautiful infinite nest of regular pentagons and pentagrams (figure 16.13).

**Fig. 16.13** Nested pentagons and pentagrams.

In both cases, one can stop there, simply admiring the beautiful diagrams. But we can go further, applying truly infinite arguments to deduce that the golden rectangle is a truly infinite creature.

#### **16.10 A Golden Argument**

The _golden ratio φ_ is defined to be the length divided by the width of a golden rectangle. It is indeed both golden and a ratio, but there is more: _the golden ratio is irrational_. That is, although _φ_ is defined as a ratio, we cannot write   as a fraction, as the ratio of two natural numbers _A_ and _B_.

How can we see this? Suppose that _φ were_ a fraction. That would mean there was a golden rectangle with natural number sidelengths _A_ and _B_ (figure 16.14).

But then, the next golden rectangle would have natural number sides (of lengths _B_ and _A − B_ ). And, so would the next, and the next, and the next. So, we would have an infinite, descending sequence of natural numbers, and that's impossible!

**Fig. 16.14** _A, B_ , and _A − B_ are all natural numbers, with _A > B > A − B_.

#### **16.11 Poetic Summation**

Finally, we return to the _The Saragossa Manuscript_ , where Alfonse Van Worden criticizes Don Pedro's use of a mathematical analogy. Don Pedro responds, pithily describing the power of the mathematics of infinity, and of mathematics in general:

2:29

_DON PEDRO: Something like quotients which can be divided infinitely.  
VAN WORDEN: I am a captain of the guard. Not a philosopher. Your mathematics is just dead numbers_.

_DON PEDRO: Señor, this zero, plus and minus one, gave Newton and Archimedes power equal to the gods_.

### **Chapter 17  
Problem Corner**

Thérèse is a mathematical prodigy in _Antonia's Line_ (1985). We see her as a young girl, her precociousness on display:

_ANTONIA: Since when can you do additions?_

_THÉRÈSE: Since I was three_.

_ANTONIA: What is 147 times 48?_

_THÉRÈSE: 7056, of course.—Square root is 84. The square is 49,787,136._

_ANTONIA_ [to Thérèse's parents] _: I regret to have to tell you that your daughter is not normal_.

_THÉRÈSE: I am a wunderkind_.

In this chapter we collect some of the problems, from math competitions and the like, that have confronted movie characters. See also chapter 7 ("Escape from the Shrinking Square") for a movie full of puzzles. For the benefit of anyone who may not quite be a Thérèse-like wunderkind, we also supply some answers and some hints.

#### **17.1 Problems for Wizkids, and a Wizdog**

We begin with some problems from _Little Man Tate_ (1991), a movie about wizkids. The mathematical stars are little Fred and mathemagician Damon. The first few problems are from a math competition in which both participate.

**Problem 1:** How many minutes are there in 48 years?

**Answer** (courtesy of Damon): 25,228,800 minutes—151,368,000 seconds.

It seems Damon is assuming that there are 365 days in a year, which is a trifle odd. Even then, the number of seconds should be 1,513,728,000, but nobody seems to notice.

**Problem 2:** How many factors are there in 3067?

**Answer** (Damon again): Come on guys. There are no factors of 3067. The number is prime. Somebody, for God's sake, challenge me!

**Problem 3:** How about giving me a number, that when divided by the product of its digits the quotient is three, and if you were to add 18 to this number the digits would be inverted?

**Answer** (Fred): 24.

Assuming the number we're looking for has two digits, we can write it as 10 _X_ \+ _Y_ , with _X_ and _Y_ natural numbers from 0 to 9. Then the information provided gives us two equations for _X_ and _Y_ , and it's easy to show that the only integer solution is _X_ = 2, _Y_ = 4. One can also look for solutions with more than two digits: it's trickier, but it can be shown there are no further solutions to be found.

**Problem 4:** What is the cube root of 3,796,466?

**Answer** (Fred): 156.

Again, there is a mistake. For Fred's answer to be correct, the quizmaster should have asked for the cube root of 3,796,416.

The following is our favorite problem in this movie.

**Problem 5** (Teacher) How many of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are divisible by 2? [Figure 17.1]

**Fig. 17.1** How many of these numbers are divisible by 2?

**Answer** (Fred): Um, all of them.

And one more problem from the math competition.

**Problem 6:** What number has the following peculiarity. If its cube were added to five times its square and from the result 42 times the number and 40 is subtracted, the remainder is nothing.

**Answer** (Fred): 5.

If we let _X_ stand for the number we're after, then the information provided amounts to the equation _X_ 3 \+ 5 _X_ 2 − (42 _X_ \+ 40) = 0. One solution to this equation is Fred's answer, _X_ = 5. However, since it's a cubic equation, we expect two more solutions. Given that we know one answer, it is not hard to factor ( _X_ − 5) into the cubic, and then use the quadratic formula to obtain the two answers that Fred missed:   and   Possibly Fred only concerned himself with finding an integer solution. However, after making a fool of his teacher with the previous problem, it is only fair that we nitpick Fred here.

Next, we have the questions from the School Mathletes State Championship in _Mean Girls_ (2004).

**Problem 7:** Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71. What are... ?

**Answer:** 14 and 5.

Writing _X_ and _Y_ for the two numbers, it is easy to set up and solve the simultaneous equations.

**Problem 8:** Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12. The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between...

**Answer:** 741.

The quizmaster doesn't mention it, but 147, 345 and 543 also work.

**Problem 9:** Find the limit of this "equation":

**Answer:** The limit doesn't exist!

This is the problem Cady (Lindsay Lohan) must solve to grab her school the title. She gets the answer correct. However, except for the advice to herself to stop thinking about boys, she gives no clue how she does it.

Here are two nice puzzles from _Eustice Solves a Problem_ (2004).

**Problem 10:** How many ways are there of walking up a flight of 10 stairs if you take either 1 or 3 steps with each step?

**Answer:** 28.

This problem is closely related to the Fibonacci numbers. Writing _S N_ for the number of ways of walking up _N_ stairs by taking 1 or 3 steps at a time, what we're asked for is _S_ 10. Taking it slowly, it is obvious that there is only one way to climb one or two steps, so _S_ 1 = 1 and _S_ 2 = 1. Given three steps, we can either take them one at a time or do a 3-step leap, and so _S_ 3 = 2.

For _N_ beyond 3, any method of getting up _N_ steps will first arrive at the ( _N_ − 1)st step or the ( _N_ − 3)rd step. This leads to the key equation _S N_ = _S_ _N_ −1 \+ _S_ _N_ −3. We can then churn out the sequence up to the 10th term: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28. Note that, if instead we were allowed to take 1-step and 2-step moves, the key equation would be _S N_ = _S_ _N_ −1 \+ _S_ _N_ −2, which would give the Fibonacci numbers.

**Problem 11:** In a bakery the ratio of pies to cakes is 2:3 and the ratio of cakes to scones is 8:1. What is the ratio of pies and cakes to scones?

**Answer:** 40:3.

Letting _P_ , _C_ , and _S_ stand respectively for the number of pies, cakes, and scones, the information provided is   and   Then   and so

The movie _Tom_ & _Viv_ (1994) is about T. S. Eliot and his supposedly crazy wife Vivienne. It features a couple of clever math puzzles. In fact, some (truly crazy) people decide that if Vivienne cannot solve the second and third puzzles below, then this means that she is crazy and needs to be committed to an insane asylum.

**Problem 12:** A lady when asked her age replied that she was 35, not counting Saturdays and Sundays. What was her real age?

**Answer:** 49.

The lady is counting only   of the days, and so her pretend age should be multiplied by

**Problem 13:** Rupert takes his friends to the opera. Rupert is sitting next to Charles and on his left, Daphne immediately on Charles's right, and Clarissa sits somewhere to the left of Daphne. Can you put them into their correct order?

**Answer:** From left to right, the order is Clarissa, Rupert, Charles, Daphne.

**Problem 14:** A greasy pole is 10 yards high. A little brown monkey wishes to climb the pole. The monkey climbs 3 yards a day, and at night he slips back 2 yards. How many days will it take him to reach the top?

**Answer:** 8.

After the seventh night, the monkey will be 7 yards up. So he'll make it to the top on the eighth day, and then slip back down 2 yards on the eighth night.

In the Kung Fu movie _Brave Archer III_ (1981), the mysterious Auntie Ying is teased with a problem.

**Problem 15:** A number that divided by 3 leaves 2, divided by 5 leaves 3, and divided by 7 leaves 2. What is the number?

**Answer:** 23, though Auntie Ying doesn't answer.

Once we've checked that 23 works, notice that adding 3 × 5 × 7 = 85 won't change the remainders. So 108 also works, as does 23 + 85 _N_ for any natural number _N_.

_Bingo_ (1991) is the story of a very smart dog. In one scene, he helps his owner Chuckie with his homework.

**Problem 16:** What is the square root of 9?

**Answer:** Woof! Woof! Woof!

#### **17.2 Math Quiz for Mortals**

Here are some problems from the math competition in _Lambada_ (1991). Some supposed no-hopers come through on the big day.

**Problem 17:** You plotted the position of a star in relation to the background stars six months ago and again last night. The angle of shift in the star's position is eight-tenths of a second. How would you determine the distance of this star from the Earth?

**Answer:** "With a big tape measure. [ _Laughter_ ] Okay, okay. But if I couldn't find no tape measure, I guess I'd have to use the trigonometric parallax. See, I'd start with a right triangle formed by the Sun, the stars and the position of the Earth last night. That makes my angle of interest 0.4 seconds, and the far side is the distance from the Earth to the Sun in one astronomical unit. The near side, with the length we don't know, is the distance from our solar system to the star. Now you measure the ratio far side over near side for a right triangle when the angle of interest is 0.4 seconds. Uh, somethin' like that."

The suggested solution is not precisely correct, although it is probably close enough in practice. The star, the Earth, and the Sun will not in general form a right triangle, and the angle of interest will not in general be 0.4 degrees. And, because of the Earth's elliptical orbit, the Sun will be at a focal point of the orbit rather than at the center. However, because the star is so far away in comparison to the Sun-Earth distance, treating the triangle as a right triangle is a quick and reasonable method for obtaining an estimate of the distance to the star.

**Problem 18:** Describe the Cartesian coordinate system.

**Answer:** It's a system where points on a plane are identified by pairs of numbers that represent distances from two perpendicular lines.

**Problem 19:** The abscissa of a point in the plane is the distance of the point from the _x_ -axis. The ordinate is the distance of the point from the _y_ -axis. Given an equation 2 _x_ \+ 3 _y_ = 12, what are the coordinates of the solution?

**Answer:** "You got the question wrong." "Young lady, if you can't answer the question, leave the microphone." "No, see you reversed them. The abscissa is the vertical line from the point in the plane from the _y_ -axis."

No one is doing very well here, with both getting the definitions wrong: if the coordinates of a point are ( _x, y_ ) then the abscissa is _x_ , i.e., the distance from the point to the _y_ -axis, and the ordinate is _y_. Anyway, the no-hoper answers with one of the infinitely many correct solutions.

In _Little Big League_ (1994) the Minnesota Twins baseball team has to help their teenage manager finish his homework before the big game. Absolutely hilarious.

**Problem 20:** If Joe can paint a house in three hours and Sam can paint the same house in five hours, how long does it take for them to do it together? [Figure 17.2]

**Answers:** "You never said this was a word problem." "What color paint?" "It's simple, 5 times 3, that's 15" "No, no, no. Look, it takes 8 hours, 5 plus 3." "Check it out, there is one, two of them. It only takes 4 hours." "I should know this, my uncle's a painter." "Why don't they just get a house that's already painted." "You know, maybe there is no answer, maybe this is one of those trick questions. Did you ever think of that?" "I don't know, I mean 8 sounds good to me." "Fellows, fellows, fellows, fellows, fellows. The chalk, if you please. Thank-you. Using the simple formula _A_ times _B_ over _A_ plus _B_ , we arrive at our answer of   equals one and seven eights." "Wow, are you sure." "Oh ho, but of course, my diminutive leader. Long have I been familiar with the exactitudes of the mathematical world."

**Fig. 17.2** What color paint?

Here is a problem attempted by one of the protagonists in _Wish Upon a Star_ (1996).

**Problem 21:** A cleaning solution is made up of three chemicals. _A, B_ , and _C_. There are equal amounts of _A_ and _B_ and four times as much _C_ as there is _A_. What percentage of the bottle is full of _C_?

**Answer:** _B_ = _A_ and _C_ = 4 _A_. So _A_ \+ _B_ \+ _C_ = _A_ \+ _A_ \+ 4 _A_ = 6 _A_. Therefore, your percentage is   the _A_ s cancel,   is converted to   Therefore, the percentage is 66.6%.

#### **17.3 Devilish Problems**

The first devilish problem appears as homework in _Bedazzled_ (2000), with Elizabeth Hurley playing the devil.

**Problem 22:** _x n_ \+ _y n_ \+ _z n_. Solve for _n >_ 2. Show your work!

**Answer:** See chapter 14 ("Pythagoras and Fermat Go to the Movies").

In _Diabolique_ (1955), the teacher tests her students with the following geometry problem.

**Problem 23:** The area of a hexagon in relation to the radius of the circumference?

**Answer:** In the movie, the answer is given as   with _AB_ equal to the radius and _OH_ the altitude of one of the equilateral triangles making up the hexagon (figure 17.3). This is correct as far as it goes, but does not really answer the question. The precise answer is

In 1996, _Diabolique_ was remade, again titled _Diabolique_. Sharon Stone appears as the math teacher, and there is a corresponding classroom scene. As a sign of the times, the problem posed is of a slightly different caliber:

**Fig. 17.3** Calculating the area of a regular hexagon in _Diabolique_.

**Problem 24:** 10 plus _x_ when _x_ equals 3 is?

Any reader who struggles with this problem should feel free to contact us for the solution.

#### **17.4 Crazy Problems for Extra Credit**

Here is a very tough problem, although it doesn't phase the robot Brainman in the _Thunderbirds_ episode "Sun Probe" (1965).

**Problem 25:** I want you to calculate the following equation. What is the square root to the power of 29 of the trigonometric amplitude of 87 divided by the quantitative hydraxis of 956 to the power of 77?

**Answer:** 45,969, apparently.

In the teen slasher flick _Cutting Class_ (1989), Paula and her math teacher are set a word problem to solve. The answer will inform them whether they can safely exit by door number 1 or door number 2.

**Problem 26:** Which door? Get it right or die! A train leaves Chicago at 8, heading east. Another train leaves Boston heading west at 8. At what time do the trains collide? _X_ equals 1 or 2?

**Answer:** Not _X_ = 1. The killer gruesomely informs the math teacher that he got it wrong, because he forgot to allow for the difference in time zones.

Finally, here is a problem from the Abbott and Costello movie _Buck Privates_ (1941).

**Problem 27:** You're 40, she's 10. You're four times as old as that girl. Now you couldn't marry her, so you wait 5 years. Now the little girl is 15, you're 45. You're only three times as old as that little girl, so you wait 15 years more. Now the little girl is 30, you're 60. You're only twice as old as that little girl. How long do you have to wait until you and that little girl are the same age?

**Answer:** "What kind of question is that?" "Answer the question." "That's ridiculous." "What's ridiculous?" "If I keep waiting for her she'll pass me up." "What are you talking about?" "She'll wind up older than me."

### **Chapter 18  
Money-Back Bloopers**

It's pretty hard for a movie with math to totally avoid bloopers. However, some are simply unforgivable, or are forgivable and just really, really funny. In this chapter, we've collected some of the best.

#### **18.1 Boosting the Computer**

In the _Star Trek_ episode "Court Martial" (1967), Captain Kirk comes up with a brilliant idea:

_CAPTAIN KIRK: Gentleman, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power_.

#### **18.2 Playing the Percentages**

In _Alien Hunter_ (1987), the mathematician Julian is calculating the chances:

_SHELLY: It still could be hidden in the protein_.

_KATE: You know how unlikely that is.  
JULIAN: How unlikely? What are the odds?  
SHELLY: 99.999 to the infinite_.

_JULIAN: But not 100_.

In the second episode of the TV series _FlashForward_ (2009), the FBI is pondering the chances of everyone on the planet blacking out at exactly 11 a.m. (Pacific time):

_AGENT: There are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute. So the chances of something happening at exactly the top of any hour are 1 in 3600_.

It's reassuring to know that the FBI are on the case.

In _The Bridge on the River Kwai_ (1957), Major Warden is deciding whether Commander Shears should take some practice parachute jumps before the big mission:

_WARDEN: They say if you make one jump you've only got 50% chance of injury, two jumps 80%, and three jumps you're bound to catch your packet. The consensus of opinion is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump and hope for the best_.

_SHEARS: With or without a parachute?_

They're in the middle of a war, so one can understand they'll go with rough and ready calculations. However, assuming that the chance of getting injured on any jump is independent of the other jumps, the percentages should be 50%, 75%, and 87.5%. And, one would hope that the benefit of practice is that the later percentages would be lower.

In _The Arrival_ (1996), Ilana and her fellow climate scientist are discussing the increases in certain gases:

_ILANA: 700% increase over the last five years. How can that be?  
SCIENTIST: My very question. Just how accurate is this data you sent us, Ilana?_

_ILANA: Well, that's hard to say. We cobbled it together from ground stations, weather balloons, Uncle Earl's aching corns. Some of your own numbers are in there_.

_SCIENTIST: Well, you've obviously got some ratty data_.

_ILANA: We checked this as best we could_.

**Fig. 18.1** Some brilliant combining of percentages in the _The Arrival_.

Their data may well be ratty, but not nearly as ratty as their method of combining percentages (figure 18.1).

#### **18.3 The Curse of Pi**

Apparently, almost any movie that tries to nail down more than a few digits of the decimal expansion of _π_ is doomed to fail. In _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ (1959) the birdlike pi creature recites: " _π_ is equal to 3.14159265389747, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." Oddly, the last two digits are wrong, and it should be 3.1415926535897 **93**... In _The Virgin Suicides_ (1999), a classroom displays what are supposed to be the first forty-seven digits of _π_ ; sadly, things already go wrong after the eleventh digit. The title sequence of the movie _π_ (1998) has thousands of digits scrolling across the screen, clearly meant to be digits of _π_ , but only the first nine digits are correct. And the grand prize goes to _Never Been Kissed_ (1999), with an earth-shattering three correct digits (figure 18.2):

**Fig. 18.2** _π_ (more or less) in _Never Been Kissed_.

Another interesting attempt occurs in Kate Bush's song "Pi," from her album _Aerial_ (2005). It's a beautiful song, but her attempt to recite the first 138 digits of _π_ goes awry:

3.

1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510

5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825 3421170679

8214808651 3282306647 0938446095 5058223.

All the underlined digits are missing. But it's a weird song, so maybe it's just that the deeper meaning was lost on us.

It seems that _π_ can also curse movies in other ways. In _St. Trinians_ (2007), there begins a very funny scene where Peaches answers that the volume of a sphere is "quite loud." Unfortunately, the intended humor is overshadowed by the unintended humor, when everybody agrees that the correct answer is actually _πr_ 3. This exact same blooper, along with the traditional blooper   appears in the Pyecraft episode of _The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells_ (2001); see figure 18.3.

**Fig. 18.3** Some good and bad _π_.

#### **18.4 Prime Problems**

In _Contact_ (1997), the heroine Ellie (Jodie Foster) explains what a prime number is:

_ELLIE: Prime numbers. That would be integers that are only divisible by themselves and 1_.

Almost. Except that Ellie should have specified integers greater than 1. After all, it is an important convention not to count the number 1 among the prime numbers. True, this is nitpicky, but sometimes it is important to get this right.

For example, in _The Core_ (2003), the hero is told that a secret message can be decrypted using prime numbers. He immediately types in 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. Voilà, it works! Luckily both he and the person who encrypted the message are under the impression that 1 is a prime number.

Even experts can get this wrong. Here's math professor Gregory Larkin in _The Mirror Has Two Faces_ (1996):

_GREG: My number here is 01712577355, all prime numbers, by the way_.

Well, there are definitely a few that are not...

In _The Music of Chance_ (1993), the weird duo of Flower and Stone explain how they chose their winning lottery numbers:

_FLOWER: Prime numbers. It was all so neat, and elegant. Numbers that refuse to cooperate, that don't change or divide. Numbers that remain the same for all eternity_.

_STONE: 3, 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 31,..._

_FLOWER: Ah, it was the magic combination, the key to the gates of heaven_.

We're very happy for Stone and Flower. We're just not sure why the meaning of "prime number" doesn't also remain the same for all eternity: what happened to 2, 5, 17, and 29?

Everybody knows that if a positive integer ends in 2 or 5 then it is not prime (unless the number is 2 or 5 itself). Nonetheless, Leaven, the math genius in _Cube_ (1997), takes a _very_ long time figuring out that 645 and 372 are not prime numbers. She then sees immediately that 649 = 11 × 59, and so 649 is not prime. Also, in the same movie, Kazan, an idiot savant, is supposedly very good at factoring numbers, but actually gets quite a few wrong; see chapter 6 ("Escape from the Cube") for details.

A more testing game of "prime not-prime" is played by McKay and Zelenka in the episode "Hot Zone" of _Stargate: Atlantis_ (2004). They tease the jockish Lieutenant Ford for refusing to play, and Ford misses a great opportunity to squish them: they have just incorrectly declared that 4021 is not prime.

Finally, returning to _Contact_ , Ellie and her colleagues have pinpointed a signal from outer space. Initially, we hear two pulses:

_ELLIE: Come on_. [We hear three pulses.]

_ELLIE: All right. It's restarting. Wait a minute, those are numbers. That was 3, the one before it was 2. Um, base ten numbers, just start counting now and see how far we can get_. [Five pulses.]

_WILLIE: Five_. [Seven pulses.]

_ELLIE: Seven. Those are primes 2, 3, 5, 7. Those are all prime numbers, there's no way this is a natural phenomenon!_

That may well be. But, as nitpickers, we have to point out that we have no idea what a "base ten number" is.

#### **18.5 Slips of the Tongue**

In the Z-grade horror movie _Shrieker_ (1997), the heroine math major Clark is apparently studying "multidimensional topography." However, unless the Earth suddenly became four-dimensional, we assume she meant "multidimensional topology."

In the episode "Trees Made of Glass, Part 2" (2005) of the TV series _Threshold_ , the resident math genius Arthur Ramsey mentions "isomorphic group therapy." Just "group theory" would have made (a little bit) more sense.

#### **18.6 Less Is More**

In _Karate Kid,Part II_ (1986), the Karate Kid discovers that the bad guys are cheating farmers by using weights that are too light. Actually, since the weights go on one side of the scales and the farmers' goods on the other, this means that the bad guys were cheating themselves.

#### **18.7 Simple Arithmetic?**

In _The World Is not Enough_ (1999), a bomb is traveling at 70 miles per hour and is 106 miles from its target. James Bond immediately declares that they have 78 minutes to stop it. In fact, they have 91 minutes.

In _Entrapment_ (1999), Catherine Zeta-Jones says she wants a security clock to lose 10 seconds. She then rigs the clock to lose   of a second each minute, for an hour.

In _Bloodhounds of Broadway_ (1952), Numbers Foster is a bookie who practices multiplication to help himself relax. At one point, he declares that 52 × 95 = 5044.

In _Butterfly Dreaming_ (2008), math professor Rob estimates the number of leaves on a tree to be 212: "about 8000."

In the episode "From Agnes with Love" of _The Twilight Zone_ (1964), El-wood is testing Agnes, his jealous and erratic computer. He asks her to calculate "the first prime number larger than the 17th root of 9,000,355,126,606." Agnes "correctly" gives the answer as 5, when in fact the answer is 7. (Agnes's answer would actually have been correct if Elwood had asked for a number around nine billion instead of nine trillion.)

In "The Mind Robber" story of _Doctor Who_ (1968), the Master explains how much he has written:

_MASTER: For twenty-five years, I delivered five thousand words every week.  
ZOE: Well, that's over half a million words!_

Zoe is correct, and the Master has indeed delivered _over_ half a million words: six million over.

In _Super Mario Bros_. (1993), a lizard-man exits an evolution machine. He promptly, and incorrectly, declares that the square root of 26,481 is 191. He should have started with 36,481.

In _Il Posto_ (1961), the main character applies for a job. A main part of the assessment test is to solve the following problem: _We have a roll of copper wire 520 meters long. Three-quarters of it are cut off. Of the remainder, we cut off four-fifths. How many centimeters of wire are left on the roll?_ He's given one hour to solve this problem, and his answer, 24, is wrong. (The correct answer is 26.) Still, he gets the job.

#### **18.8 A Very Tough Quadratic**

In _Outside Providence_ (1999), the teacher solves the quadratic equation 2 _X_ 2 \+ 7 _X_ \+ 3 = 0 on the blackboard and then, with the solution still there, asks Dunphy to solve it; Dunphy fails. Later, after lots of hard work, Dunphy has to solve the exact same equation; this time he succeeds.

#### **18.9 The Algebra Problem**

In the episode "The Algebra Problem" in the TV series _Meet Corliss Archer_ (1954), everybody and their uncle is trying to solve Corliss's "algebra" homework problem:

_CORLISS: There are 17 prisoners in a jail, and there are 9 policemen in the courthouse, but they have one police car that holds 6 people, including the driver, and only a policeman can drive it. At no time can there be more prisoners than policemen, in the courthouse, in the jail, or in the car. The policemen have to bring the prisoners to the courthouse. How can all the prisoners be moved in 5 round trips?_

The problem is impossible for a number of simple reasons, but no one seems to notice. At the end of the episode, it turns out that the teacher made a mistake: there are 15 prisoners, and 7 trips are permitted. However, the problem is still impossible.

#### **18.10 A Tough Competition**

In the episode "Looks and Books" of _Freaks and Geeks_ (2000), Lindsay rejoins the mathletes and takes part in a competition. In the longest ever blooper, every answer in the competition is incorrect: the hour hand of a clock moves 0.4 radians in 48 minutes; a rhombus with long diagonal 10 and large angle 100 degrees has area 42; if arcsin _X_ = 2 arccos _X_ then _X_ = 0.9; the inscribed sphere of a cube has 0.52 times the volume of the cube.

#### **18.11 Scary Geometry**

In _The Man Without a Face_ , (1993) Mel Gibson plays a scary man, teaching his pupil Norstadt some even scarier geometry; see figure 18.4:

**Fig. 18.4** A very unlikely right angle.

_SCARY MAN: Draw a circle_ ABC. _Draw within it any straight line_ AB. _Now bisect_ AB _at_ D _and draw a straight line_ DC _at right angles to_ AB. _You are following so far Norstadt?_

_NORSTADT: Yes, Sir_.

_SCARY MAN: Okay, any other straight line_ AC. _Bisect_ AC _and you get the center of the circle_.

In _Cabiria_ (1914), we see Archimedes designing his parabolic mirrors. Unfortunately, he's using a compass to do so (figure 18.5).

In _Stargate_ (1994), Dr. Jackson is explaining a strange astronomical scroll to General West:

_JACKSON: Now these constellations were placed in a unique order forming a map or an address of sorts. Seven points to outline a course to a position. And, uh, to find a destination in any three-dimensional space you need six points to determine an exact location_.

**Fig. 18.5** Archimedes and his famous compass?

_WEST: You said you needed seven points_.

_JACKSON: Well, no, six for the destination. But to chart a course you need a point of origin (figure 18.6)_.

**Fig. 18.6** To locate the gray point, you need the six midpoints of faces of the cube and one point outside the cube.

Jackson seems to be confusing points in space with coordinates for points. Given a frame of reference, three coordinates are needed. To establish a frame of reference, four constellations could be chosen, one at the origin and then three along the chosen coordinate axes. Then any point in that coordinate system could be specified with three coordinates: a total of seven pieces of information.

And a final, quick, coordinate geometry blooper: in _Annapolis_ (2006), Navy recruits learn calculus and plot their maps with strange bearings: "65 degrees 85 minutes north."

### **Chapter 19**

The previous chapter was dedicated to listing the funniest mathematical bloopers. Here, we list the funniest math scenes that are _intentionally_ funny.

#### **19.1 Sex**

##### **Rules of Attraction (2002)**

Lauren and Lara are discussing safe sex:

_LARA: Okay, we'll do the math. If a condom is 98% safe, and he wears two, then you're 196% safe. A better percentage than the pill can offer.  
LAUREN: I don't think it works that way, Lara. Abstinence is 100% safe, which is less a percentage than—_  
 _LARA: Whatever. I don't care, I don't major in math_.

##### **The Favor (1994)**

The mathematician Peter is in the kitchen making a sandwich and rabbiting on about nonlinear dynamics. His wife Kathy walks in, dressed in a sexy nightie, and tries various food-based techniques to entice Peter—totally without success. Finally he concludes she's hungry and offers her a sandwich.

For more details on the first five entries, see chapter 14 ("Pythagoras and Fermat Go to the Movies").

##### **The Wizard of Oz (1939)**

The Scarecrow proves to himself that he has a brain by misquoting Pythagoras's theorem: "The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side." Homer Simpson rips off the Scarecrow's Pythagorean declaration in the episode "$pringfield (or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)" (1993) (figure 19.2).

**Fig. 19.2** The Scarecrow's (and Homer's) mutilation of Pythagoras's theorem.

##### **Merry Andrew (1958)**

EVERYBODY EXCEPT BATMAN: A cat!_  
 _BATMAN: Yes, Gentlemen, the criminal catless to this entire affair: our old arch enemy, Catwoman_.  
 _COMMISSIONER GORDON: Penguin, Joker, Riddler, and Catwoman, too. The sum of the angles of that rectangle is too monstrous to contemplate!_

##### **Battlefield Earth (2000)**

A tedious movie, but it does contain one interesting and funny math scene. After being passed through a learning machine by the monster captors, our hero Tyler explains some mathematics to his fellow prisoners:

_PRISONER 1: This is the monster's language?_

_HERO: No, no, this is mathematics. This is the unifying language of the entire Universe. Look, this symbol is called the triangle. If all its sides are equal, then these three angles must also be equal_. [Figure 19.3]  
 _PRISONER 2: Equal to what?_

_HERO: To each other. It's the basic foundation of Euclidean geometry.  
PRISONER 3: Seems pretty hard to understand_.

**Fig. 19.3** If the sides are equal, then the angles must also be equal. Very tough stuff.

##### **Better Off Dead (1985)**

##### **Family Guy: "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein" (2003)**

A fantasy scene demonstrating Chris's need to learn math to function in the real world. He's getting directions at a gas station: "Okay, now whatcha gotta do is go down the road, past the old Johnson place, and you're gonna find two roads, one parallel and one perpendicular. Now, keep going until you come to a highway that bisects it at a 45 degree angle. Solve for _X_."

#### **19.3 Arithmetic**

##### **In the Navy (1941)**

Our all-time favorite math scene, in which Abbott and Costello prove that 7 × 13 = 28; see chapter 10 ("7 × 13 = 28") for details, and a list of the many other movie versions.

##### **Team America: World Police (2004)**

This movie features a very funny running joke:

_COMPUTER: Several terrorist groups are being organized for one massive worldwide attack_.

_SPOTTSWOODE: From what intelligence has gathered it would be nine eleven times a hundred_.

_GARY: Nine eleven times a hundred. Jesus, that's—_

_SPOTTSWOODE: Yes, Ninety-one thousand, one hundred..._

_SPOTTSWOODE: Team, if the Durkadurkastanis have weapons of mass destruction, I'm afraid it could be nine-eleven times a thousand_.

_SARA: Jesus, you mean—_

_SPOTTSWOODE: Yes, nine hundred and eleven thousand..._

_LISA: So you're the bastard planning nine-eleven times a thousand_.

_KIM JONG IL: Nooh! You think so small. You see, I'm about to have an elaborate peace ceremony. And while all the World's most important people are distracted here, I will detonate the WMDs, which I have given to terrorists all around the globe. It will be nine-eleven times two thousand three hundred and fifty-six_.

_GARY: My God, that's—I don't even know what that is!_

_KIM JONG IL: Nobody does!_

##### **Stand and Deliver (1988)**

##### **Love and Death (1975)**

Boris (Woody Allen) with a drill sergeant:

_SERGEANT: One, two, one, two, one, two,—_

_BORIS: Three comes next, if you're having any trouble_.

Later, Boris and Sonja plan their kissing:

_SONJA: Kiss me_.

_BORIS: Which one do you want?_

_SONJA: Give me number eight_.

_BORIS: Number eight. That's two fours. That's easy_.

##### **The Road to Hong Kong (1962)**

Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's last road movie, with a couple of fun mathematical references. For example, to check that Chester (Hope) has regained his memory, Harry (Crosby) quizzes him:

_HARRY: How much is two and two?_

_CHESTER: Four_.

_HARRY: Four and four?_

_CHESTER: Eight_.

_HARRY: Eight and eight?_

_CHESTER: Seventeen_.

_HARRY: That's our boy!_

##### **Clueless (1995)**

Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is giving advice to Elton on how to look after Tai, who has been knocked to the floor:

_ELTON: What's seven times seven?_

_CHER: Stuff she knows!_

##### **Dick Tracy (1990)**

Madonna sings a fun math song: "Count your blessings, one, two, three. I just hate keeping score. Any number is fine with me. As long as it's more. As long as it's more! I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition. I find counting a bore. Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting..."

##### **Mr. Bean: "Good Night, Mr. Bean" (1990)**

To get to sleep Mr. Bean counts sheep in a picture. Losing patience, he uses a calculator to count them as 27 × 15, and immediately drops off.

_BETSY: Let's try some arithmetic: If you had six apples and your neighbor took three of them what would you have?_

_SLADE: A dead neighbor and all six apples_.

##### **Straw Dogs (1971)**

In one scene, the wife of the mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) decides to annoy him by changing a plus to a minus on his blackboard. It works (figure 19.4). Actually, the formula also changes in mysterious unintended ways; see figure 19.5. A similar scene appears in the movie _Ring_ (1998).

##### **Blackadder II: "Head" (1986)**

_BLACKADDER: Right Baldrick, let's try again. This is called adding. If I have two beans and then I add two more beans, what do I have?_

_BALDRICK: Some beans_.

_BLACKADDER: Yes—and no. Let's try again, shall we? I have two beans, then I add two more beans what does that make?_

_BALDRICK: A very small casserole_.

_BLACKADDER: Baldrick, the ape creatures of the Indus have mastered this. Now, try again. One, two, three, four! So how many are there?_

_BALDRICK: Three_.

_BLACKADDER: What?_

_BALDRICK: And that one_.

**Fig. 19.4** Dustin Hoffmann spotting the destruction of his plus sign in _Straw Dogs_.

**Fig. 19.5** The _Straw Dogs_ mystery: These are consecutive views of the formula on the blackboard. To annoy the mathematician his wife changes the plus sign on the right to a minus sign. Strangely the sign on the left also keeps changing. Since this is not a ghost story, it is presumably not intentional.

_BLACKADDER: Three and that one. So if I add that one to the three what will I have?_

_BALDRICK: Ah! Some beans_.

##### **Mozart and the Whale (2005)**

This is a lovely movie, a very sweet romance between Donald and Gracie, both afflicted with Asperger's syndrome. Donald is a mathematical prodigy, and there are a number of funny and touching math scenes. At one point Donald is looking to call Gracie and is discussing it with his similarly handicapped friends:

_DONALD: Gonna find another phone. I know the number_.

_GRACIE: Is it as good as a number as say two-eight-oh-nine?_

_DONALD: Two-eight-oh-nine is 53 squared, and 5 plus 3 is 8. The cube root of 8 is 2, which is her dress size. I bought her this beautiful little dress the other day that has these little flowers on it..._

_ROGER: Six!_

_DONALD: It's not a richly textured number, but it is her shoe size_.

##### **Knocked Up (2007)**

Ten years ago Ben got $14,000, and he has $900 left. "So that should last me for like—I mean I'm not a mathematician, but like another two years, or some shit, I think." He's out by sixteen months.

_FRED: Hmm?_

_TEACHER: I know that you can tell me. How many of these numbers are divisible by two?_

_FRED: Um, all of them_.

##### **Small Time Crooks (2000)**

The small time crooks, led by Ray (Woody Allen), are discussing how to split their prospective haul:

_DENNY: How much is my share?_

_RAY: I figure it's got to be two million, right? I'm counting the jewellery in there, too. Divided four ways that's half a million bucks apiece_.

_RAY: What about Frenchy?_

_BENNY: What about Frenchy? She's just a front_.

_RAY: Yeah, but without Frenchy we're dead_.

_TOMMY: Come on we can get any broad to sell cookies. Geez_.

_BENNY: Alright, you know what I say? She gets a share, but not a full share_.

_DENNY: Yeah, what if we each get a fourth, and she gets like a third?_

_BENNY: What are you nuts? Then she'd be getting more than us?_

_DENNY: How you figure?_

_BENNY: Where are you gonna get four fourths and a third? Can't you add?_

_DENNY: I don't do fractions, all right?_

##### **Clue (1985)**

Wadsworth the butler and Miss Scarlet are debating whether her gun is empty:

_WADSWORTH: The game's up Scarlet. There are no more bullets left in that gun_.

_MISS SCARLET: Come on, I'm not going to fall for that old trick_.

_WADSWORTH: It's not a trick. There was one shot at Mr. Body in the study, two for the chandelier, two at the lounge door, and one for the singing telegram_.

_MISS SCARLET: That's not six_.

_WADSWORTH: One plus two plus two plus one_ [1+2+2+1].

_MISS SCARLET: Nah-ah. There was only one shot that got the chandelier. That's one plus two plus one plus one_ [1+2+1+1].

_WADSWORTH: Even if you were right, that would be one plus one plus two plus one_ [1+1+2+1], _not one plus two plus one plus one_.

_MISS SCARLET: Okay, fine one plus two plus one—Shut up! Point is, there is one more bullet left in this gun, and guess who's going to get it?_

##### **Life Is Beautiful (1997)**

During WWII, the local Nazis in an Italian town are discussing how to save money:

_SCHOOLMASTER: And I'm talking about Berlin, the countryside, 3rd grade. Listen to this one. Really, it's quite shocking. The problem: Supporting a lunatic costs the state 4 marks a day, supporting a cripple costs_   _marks, an epileptic_   _marks. Figuring the average is 4 marks a day and there are 300,000 of them, how much would the state save if these individuals were simply eliminated?_

_SHOCKED_ [for the right reasons] _BYSTANDER: Completely unbelievable!_

_SCHOOLMASTER: That's exactly how I reacted. Completely unbelievable. I can't believe an elementary school child is expected to solve something like this. It's a difficult calculation. The proportions, the percentages, they need some algebra to solve these equations, right? That would be high-school material for us_.

_OTHER NAZI: No, no, it's just multiplication. What did you say it was, 300,000 cripples?_

_SCHOOLMASTER: Yes_.

_OTHER NAZI: 300,000 times 4. We'd be saving about 1,200,000 marks a day if we killed them all. It's easy_.

_SCHOOLMASTER: Exactly, bravo, but you're an adult. In Germany 7-year-olds are given this problem to work out. The most amazing race indeed_.

#### **19.4 Algebra and Word Problems**

##### **Freaky Friday (2003)**

Jamie Lee Curtis is caught in her daughter Anna's (Lindsay Lohan's) body. She's reading a math exam question to herself: "The sum of the areas of the shaded regions above in terms of _D_ is equal to (a) _D_ squared times the sum of pi divided by 4 minus _D_ divided by 2, (b) _D_ squared times the sum of pi cubed divided by D minus 2. Now, what is pi again? 3 point something? Oh this is ridiculous, I've never used pi. Anna's never gonna use pi. Why's it called pi anyway? Okay, focus—Or (c) _D_ cubed minus the sum of pi squared minus—"

##### **Twin Peaks: "1.5" (1990)**

The sexy Audrey Horne correctly sums up the situation: "I've been doing some research. In real life, there is no algebra."

##### **Quality Street (1937)**

Phoebe (Katharine Hepburn) and Susan are struggling to run their little school:

_SUSAN: Phoebe. If a herring and a half costs three ha'pence, how many for elevenpence?_

_PHOEBE: Eleven_.

_SUSAN: William Smith says it's fifteen, and he's such a big boy. Do you think I ought to contradict him? May I suggest there are differences of opinion about it? One can't be really sure, Phoebe_.

_PHOEBE: It is eleven! I once worked it out with real herrings_.

##### **I Went Down (1997)**

A hilarious scene, with a kidnap victim tied to a bed, and left holding a remote so he can watch TV. He's flicking through the channels, and just gets to an education channel when he drops the remote. He's stuck watching some very nerdy mathematicians proving the fundamental theorem of algebra.

##### **Idiocracy (2006)**

An average Joe from today wakes up in the future and finds himself the most intelligent man on Earth. He is forced to take an IQ test: "If you have one bucket that holds 2 gallons, and another bucket that holds 5 gallons, how many buckets do you have?"

##### **Desk Set (1957)**

Richard (Spencer Tracy) tests Bunny (Katharine Hepburn):

_RICHARD: A train started out at Grand Central, with seventeen passengers aboard and a crew of nine. At 125th Street, four got off and nine got on. At White Plains, three got off and one got on. At Chappaqua, nine got off and four got on. And at each successive stop thereafter nobody got off, nobody got on, till the train reached its next-to-the-last stop, where five people got off and one got on. Then it reached the terminal_.

_BUNNY: Well that's easy, eleven passengers and a crew of nine_.

_RICHARD: Uh, that's not the question_.

_BUNNY: I'm sorry_.

_RICHARD: How many people got off at Chappaqua?_

_BUNNY: Nine_.

_RICHARD: That's correct!_

_BUNNY: Yes, I know_.

_KID 1: Louis left his house at 2:15, and has to travel the distance of 6.2 miles at the rate of 5 miles per hour. What time will Louis arrive?_

_KID 2: Depends if he stops to see his ho_.

_KID 1: That's what we call a variable_.

Later, a senator proposes fining the El Dorado Tobacco Company infinity billion dollars; another senator suggests that fining them a real number would be more effective.

#### **19.5 Mathematicians in Action**

##### **The Big Bang Theory: "Pilot" (2007)**

_SHELDON: There's some poor women who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm. What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve for the area under a curve?_

_LEONARD: I'm sure she'll still love him_.

_SHELDON: I wouldn't_.

##### **Flubber (1997)**

Professor Phillip Brainard, played by Robin Williams, stumbles into a life drawing class and begins lecturing about gravity. Great improvisation involving the nude models and a dead pheasant.

##### **Wonder Woman: "The Pluto File" (1976)**

Professor Warren uses the harmonic equation and other partial differential equations to create earthquakes. He then struggles to figure out how to stop them, but Wonder Woman comes to the rescue. She declares "integral calculus is always problematical," and then shows the professor the critical substitutions.

##### **That's Adequate (1989)**

We are shown a scene of the new movie _Einstein on the Bounty_. Albert Einstein, as the young sea captain of a sailing ship, is talking to his crew, with an active volcano in the background:

_EINSTEIN: Whoa! Look at those girls on the beaches. Especially the ones that aren't on fire. You know, there's a lot to learn here. You know one can contemplate the secrets of time, space, matter, energy, all that bullshit. Molecules heating, gases expanding, atoms colliding, matter exploding. It's just fucking brilliant! Wait, wait, now let's see. I was on to something there. E—equals—m—a—no_. [The volcano erupts.] _Jesus Christ! I got it! Time! Space! Matter! Energy! E equals m fucking c squared! Yeah!_ [At that moment, another ship appears.] _Oh, shit! Look, it's the pirates from the Berlin Academy of Physics. They roam the seas looking for radical physicists with new ideas. Off with their heads!_

[Cut to the fighting.]

_PIRATE 1: Fuck relativity!_

_PIRATE 2: Down with new theory!_

[Einstein is crossing swords with a third pirate.]

_EINSTEIN: E—equals—m—c—squared—you bad boy!_

##### **Insignificance (1985)**

This movie contains a very long, absolutely brilliant scene in which Marilyn Monroe demonstrates to Albert Einstein the theory of relativity. The movie also contains a great scene in which Einstein describes to Marilyn the shape of the Universe (as a three-dimensional sphere); see chapter 15 ("Survival in the Fourth Dimension").

##### **Eureka: "Blink" (2006)**

Two stereotypically ditzy cheerleaders are chatting as they walk to class: "which basically means certain nonlinear dynamical systems, extremely sensitive to initial conditions..." "exhibits a phenomenon known as chaos. Come on Courtney, that's a textbook definition. You gotta take specific evaluation..."

##### **Magik and Rose (1999)**

A hilarious New Zealand movie, featuring a square-dancing mathematical prodigy who is into chaos theory.

##### **Everybody Loves Raymond: "Ally's F" (2004)**

Ray and Debra go to see Ally's math teacher. He is unsympathetic: "The thing about math is, numbers are constant, they're clear. They're—logical, they're organized. Thirteen-year-olds are—not.—Their home lives and their love lives and their social lives, are not my problem. That is my problem, and the answer is pi!" Ray sums him up: "If _X_ equals lame, that guy is four times _X_."

##### **Lucky Pierre (1974)**

The DVD of this French comedy comes without subtitles. However, you don't have to understand a word to enjoy the hilarious scene where Pierre Richard plays a manic teacher giving a math lesson; see page 145 for a screenshot.

#### **19.6 Doing the Impossible**

##### **Lambada (1991)**

In one scene the supercool math teacher Blade is making a close to impossible three-cushion billiards shot using a protractor and his knowledge of the "Cartesian coordinate system"; see also chapter 5 ("Nitpicking in Mathmagic Land").

##### **Teresa's Tattoo (1994)**

Teresa is a PhD student in applied mathematics. There are some very funny scenes featuring her trying (unsuccessfully) to tell various clueless people what she does. Also, when she is heavily drugged, Teresa recites the quadratic formula.

##### **Graveyard Disturbance (1987)**

This is a cheap but fun horror movie, where five teenagers get lost in a cemetery building that loops around in an impossible way. One of them tries to make sense of it by referring to Escher's impossible drawings.

Similar impossible geometry pops up in a number of other movies, always in fun ways. In _The Matrix Revolutions_ (2003), Neo gets stuck in a train station, which loops around à la Pacman. In the sitcom world of _Pleasantville_ (1998), a geography teacher explains how the town loops back on itself; it's a very funny scene, although the DVD commentary makes clear that the writer-director didn't completely understand what he was doing.

There are also a few scenes based on Escher's drawing _Relativity_ , a picture of an impossible staircase in which gravity seems to be pulling in three different directions. These include _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer the Great" (1995), in which the beginning couch gag is modeled after this drawing; and the staircase in _Labyrinth_ (1986), on which David Bowie (who plays the king of the goblins) walks around.

_AURA: They've changed the code!_

_BARIN_ [romantically] _: I've changed too, Aura.  
AURA_ [equally romantically] _: And I've changed, too.  
ZARKOV: Oh it's okay I think I can work it out_.

As Barin and Aura talk and look deep into each other's eyes, Zarkov focuses on the problem at hand and succeeds in opening the door.

_ZARKOV: Ah, I thought it was one of the prime numbers of the Zeeman series. I haven't changed!_

##### **Bingo (1991)**

_CHUCKIE: What is the square root of nine?_

_BINGO: Woof! Woof! Woof!_

##### **Proof (2005)**

This excellent movie features a scene where a rock group composed of mathematicians is performing their song entitled " _i_ ": It consists of them just standing there not playing at all.

##### **Bullshot (1983)**

Bullshot Crummond is the stereotypical gentleman English hero. He is hunting pigeons with his friend Binky Brancaster, and shoots one without looking:

_BINKY: Crummond! How the Dickens did you do that?_

_CRUMMOND: Simple, Binky. By rapidly calculating the pigeon's angle of elevation in the reflection of your monocle, then subtracting the refractive index of its lens, I positioned myself at a complementary axis and fired. It was no challenge at all_.

Later Crummond is dancing with Diz White, whose father has been kidnapped in an attempt to gain his secret formula:

_CRUMMOND: Now, can you recall your father's formula?_

_DIZ: Let's think. It started with a capital N, and then there was a little A, followed by a 3. Ah, then there was a squiggle above a tick, and ah—a hot cross bun sign_.

##### **I.Q. (1994)**

In a scene reminiscent of _Bullshot_ , Einstein and his friends are helping pretend-genius Ed "remember" a formula, without letting anybody else see what they're doing one crosses his fingers and then indicates an equal sign in the same way]: " _X_ equals—" [another holds up one finger straight and then crosses it with another finger horizontally. He follows this up by using thumb and index fingers of both hands to make a "w"] "1 + _w_ " [another holds up an ice cube and has it hovering over a pie] "cubed over pi." See [figure 19.6.

**Fig. 19.6** Signaling "cubed over pi" in _I.Q_.

##### **Thunderbirds: "Sun Probe" (1965)**

_BRAINMAN: Yes_.

_BRAINS: Off you go then..._

_BRAINMAN: 45,969_.

##### **Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990)**

The two main characters toss a coin, getting 157 heads in a row, all the while discussing what it means. Trance, a very lucky character in the sci-fi TV series _Andromeda_ , tosses 58 tails in a row in the episode "Attempting Screed."

##### **Red Planet Mars (1952)**

Scientists are contacted from Mars, and are trying to figure out how to communicate with the "Martians." The breakthrough comes when the head scientist's son gets the idea of using the digits of the decimal expansion of _π_ (while biting into a piece of pie). Hard to describe, but the movie is a crazy must-see.

#### **19.7 What Are the Odds?**

##### **My Little Chickadee (1940)**

Very funny one-liner from W. C. Fields about whether poker is a game of chance: "Not the way I play it, no."

##### **Torchy Gets Her Man (1938)**

Gahagan has a mathematical scheme for betting on the horses: "I make my mind go blank until a number pops into it. Then I multiply the number by the same number, and the last number of the result is the horse I plunk it on." He uses his system to pick horse 7 (because 6 × 6 = 37), then 4 (4 × 4 = 14), then 9 (9 × 9 = 99), then 7 (7 × 7 = 47), and then 8 (8 × 8 = 68). He wins.

#### **19.8 Odds And Ends**

Jack Black, pretending to be a teacher, leads his class in a very funny math song: "So get off your ath and do some math."

##### **Ball of Fire (1941)**

A fun movie about a team of stuffy academics being charmed by Barbara Stanwyck. When Isaac Newton is raised in conversation, she refers to herself as just another apple. The mathematician tries to find the common denominator of Stanwyck's syncopated dance moves, and argues from relativity that the signpost ran into the academics' car. Later, the academics argue over whether the correct grammar is "two and two is five" or "two and two are five." They also use Archimedes' mirror idea to thwart the bad guys.

##### **The Simpsons and Futurama**

There is a lot of mathematics to be found in various _Simpsons_ and _Futurama_ episodes. As you would expect, just about all of it is very clever and very funny.

##### **Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay (2008)**

Kumar is writing a love poem called "The square root of 3," when he is interrupted by Vanessa struggling with her "fucking calculus final." Kumar helps her with a double integral. Later, Kumar reads his poem:

_I fear that I will always be a lonely number, like root 3.  
A 3 is all that's good and right. Why must my 3 keep out of sight  
Beneath a vicious square root sign? I wish instead I were a 9.  
For 9 could thwart this evil trick with just some quick arithmetic.  
I know I'll never see the Sun as 1.7321_.  
 _Such is my reality, a sad irrationality_.  
 _When Hark!, what is this I see? Another square root of a three  
Has quietly come waltzing by. Together now we multiply  
To form a number we prefer, rejoicing as an integer.  
We break free from our mortal bonds, and with a wave of magic wands  
Our square root signs become unglued, and love for me has been renewed_.

## **Part III  
Lists**

### **Chapter 20  
People Lists**

For this chapter, we have compiled a number of annotated lists of mathematical people:

1. Real mathematicians

2. Female mathematicians

3. Notable math teachers and classroom scenes

4. Wizkids

5. Murderous mathematicians

6. Famous actors being mathematical

7. Math consultants

For a comprehensive list of titles and summaries of the relevant movies, check out our MathsMasters website (www.qedcat.com). We'll continue to add to that website after this book has appeared.

#### **20.1 Real Mathematicians**

Real mathematicians seldom appear as characters in movies, and it seems that many of the mathematical greats have never appeared. The following is essentially a complete list.

**Jean d'Alembert** appears in _Si Versailles M'Était Conté_ (1954), but he has no speaking lines.

**Archimedes of Syracuse** is one of the most frequently featured mathematicians. He appears in the earliest math movie of which we are aware, _Cabiria_ (1914), in which he performs the usual geometrical construction to burn the usual Roman warships. Incredibly, Archimedes is also the hero of a sword and sandals flick, _The Siege of Syracuse_ (1960), complete with a final climactic fight (which he wins!). In this movie, Archimedes burns not only Roman warships, but more interestingly the clothing of a bathing beauty. Among Archimedes' bit roles are his being killed by Roman soldiers in _Quest of the Delta Knights_ (1993) and his Eureka scene (with towel) in _Gulliver's Travels_ (1996). A much funnier role occurs in _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_ (1982), in which Archimedes stars for Greece against Germany in the philosophers' football match: his Eureka moment comes when he decides to kick the ball.

**Charles Babbage** collaborates with Ada Byron, and his analytical engine features prominently in _Conceiving Ada_ (1997).

**Benjamin Banneker** , a black American mathematician (more astronomer and engineer) from the eighteenth century, is the main character in the TV movie _Freedom Man_ (1989). The movie ends with a very moving voiceover: "My whole life has been a mathematical proof of what a black man can do. I've been a clockmaker, a farmer, an astronomer, a surveyor, an almanac writer, a mathematician.—And I add this, and this. And I hope the sum proves something to the World."

**Isaac Beeckman** , the seventeenth-century Dutch mathematician, appears posting a problem on gravitation in _Cartesius_ (1974).

**Ada Byron** works together with Charles Babbage on the analytical engine in _Conceiving Ada_ (1997).

**Renato Caccioppoli** , one of the founders of geometric measure theory, commits suicide in _Death of a Neapolitan Mathematician_ (1992).

**Chen Jingrun** , the famous Chinese mathematician who worked on the Goldbach conjecture, is the subject of the nine-hour soapie _Chen Jingrun_ (2001).

**René Descartes** is the subject of Roberto Rossellini's _Cartesius_ (1974). The focus is much more on philosophy than mathematics. One extended scene has Descartes solving a gravitational problem posed by the mathematician Isaac Beeckman. Descartes also makes a brief appearance in Rossellini's _Blaise Pascal_ (1972) (figure 20.1).

**Euclid** is haunting the AfterMath in the mathematical musical _Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001).

**Pierre de Fermat** is the vain antihero in the mathematical musical _Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001).

**Évariste Galois** writes down his mathematical discoveries the night before the duel in _Évariste Galois_ (1965). The last days of Galois are also the subject of an extended animation sequence in _3:19_ (2008).

**Carl Friedrich Gauss** haunts the AfterMath in _Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001).

**Kurt Gödel** makes an appearance as Albert Einstein's friend in the comedy _I.Q_. (1994).

**Fig. 20.1** Marin Mersenne and Blaise Pascal meet with René Decartes in _Blaise Pascal_.

**Hua Luogeng** , the famous Chinese mathematician, appears in _Chen Jingrun_ (2001).

**Hypatia** , the first notable female mathematician in history, is the central character of _Agora_ (2009).

**Ted Kaczynski** , the Harvard-trained mathematician and notorious Unabomber, is the subject of _Unabomber: The True Story_ (1996). There is no clear reference to his being a mathematician.

**Omar Khayyam** , the famous Persian mathematician and poet, appears in a number of movies, although usually much more in the role of a poet. An improbable example is Vincent Price playing the role in _Son of Sinbad_ (1955). There are more mathematical references in _The Keeper: The Legend of Omar Khayyam_ (2005) and _Omar Khayyam_ (1957), the latter with Cornel Wilde in the starring role.

**Sonya Kovalevskaya** is the subject of the dark _A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon_ (1983).

**Gottfried Leibniz** is the vanquished goalkeeper in the philosophers' football match in _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_ (1982).

**Marin Mersenne** makes brief appearances in _Blaise Pascal_ (1972) and _Cartesius_ (1974).

**John Milnor** is the model for Hansen, John Nash's friend and competitor in _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001).

**Magnus Gustaf Mittag-Leffler** makes an appearance in _A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon_ (1983), about the mathematician Sonya Kovalevskaya.

**John Nash** is the subject of _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001).

**John von Neumann** makes a fleeting appearance in _Race for the Bomb_ (1987) (seemingly edited down from a larger role). Also Helinger, John Nash's supervisor in _A Beautiful Mind_ (2001), is modeled after von Neumann.

**Isaac Newton** has brief appearances in many movies. Most famously, he was played by an aging but still funny Harpo Marx, being hit on the head with an apple in _The Story of Mankind_ (1957). In a similar vein, Sir Isaac appears in a Mr. Peabody episode of the cartoon _Rocky and Bullwinkle_ (1961): he's having trouble proving the law of gravity, because his apples (and banana) keep going up rather than down.

Newton also discusses his _Principia_ with Peter the Great in _Peter the Great_ (1986), is the Royal Astronomer in _The King's Thief_ (1955), and is an alchemist in _Quest of the Delta Knights_ (1986). And Newton appears in hologram form in two _Star Trek_ episodes: "Descent, Part 1" from _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ (1993), and "Deathwish" from _Star Trek: Voyager_ (1996).

Newton has a larger role in the AfterMath in _Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001). He is also the subject of the romanticized biography _Newton: a Tale of Two Isaacs_ (1997). This latter movie is designed for adolescents. It is cheesy but fun, with a little mathematics of gravitation.

**Blaise Pascal** is the subject of Roberto Rossellini's _Blaise Pascal_ (1972), and appears briefly in _Cartesius_ (1974).

**Pythagoras** meets Donald Duck in _Donald in Mathmagic Land_ (1959) and haunts the AfterMath in the musical _Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001).

**Bertrand Russell** visits the barber in _Wittgenstein_ (1993) (a sly reference to Russell's version of the liar paradox), and Russell also has a minor role in _Tom & Viv_ (1994).

**Theon of Alexandria** , the father of Hypatia, makes an appearance in _Agora_ (2009).

**Alan Turing** is beautifully portrayed in _Breaking the Code_ (1996). Thomas Jericho, the main character in _Enigma_ (2001), is also modeled on Turing.

**Karl Weierstrass** makes an appearance in _A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon_ (1983), about the mathematician Sonya Kovalevskaya.

**Andrew Wiles** is one of the main characters (as Daniel Keane) in the mathematical musical _Fermat's Last Tango_ (2001).

**Nikolai Zhukovsky** , the Russian fluid dynamicist, is the subject of the movie _Zhukovsky_ (1950).

#### **20.2 Female Mathematicians**

Female mathematicians, either real or fictional, are definitely in the minority in the movies. Here's our list.

**Agora** (2009): The subject of this movie is Hypatia, generally considered to be the first notable female mathematician. Not actually a lot of math.

**Antonia's Line** (1995): A movie about a wunderkind who becomes a mathematics professor. We see her lecturing on homological algebra.

**Clan of the Cave Bear** (1986): Daryl Hannah as the first ever mathematician? She is a Cro-Magnon woman, who learns how to count in fives, using a combination of fingers, doubling, and notches on a stick.

**Conceiving Ada** (1997): The subject of this movie is Ada Byron, the famous mathematician who collaborated with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine.

**Cube 2: Hypercube** (2002): One of the victims, Mrs. Paley, is an annoying, senile mathematician. She identifies a diagram as a picture of a tesseract (a four-dimensional cube). See chapter 15.

**Dangerous Sex Date** (2001): A movie consisting of 89 minutes of murder and kinky sex, and 2 seconds of Riemann Christoffel symbols. This seems to identify the main character, a woman, as a mathematician, although she is usually listed as a librarian.

**The Giant Claw** (1957): Sally Caldwell is "Mademoiselle Mathematician," helping to defeat a murderous chicken from outer space.

**A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon** (1983): The subject of this dark movie is the Russian mathematician Sonya Kovalevskaya.

**Inspector Lewis** (2006): In this TV pilot, a female student thinks she has found a proof for the Goldbach conjecture, invalidating the work of her professor, which earned him the Fields medal. Although her proof is not correct, the professor realizes that it pinpoints a serious mistake in his work. He murders her to maintain his secret.

**It's My Turn** (1980): A light romance, with the main character a mathematics professor specializing in finite group theory. She gives a full proof of the snake lemma in the first scene and also demonstrates how to deal with annoying, uppity students. See chapter 12.

**Julie Johnson** (2001) is a downtrodden white trash housewife, who turns out to be brilliant at mathematics. There is a funny scene where she tries to explain the Cantor set to her daughter (Mischa Barton).

**Las Vegas Shakedown** (1955): A math teacher travels to Las Vegas to do research for her book, which is supposed to show that the casinos always win (well, duh).

**My Teacher's Wife** (1995): The smart and attractive wife of the math teacher herself has a PhD in math. She demonstrates that she is very good at mental calculations and calculus.

**Presumed Innocent** (1990): A murder mystery, and a morality tale for PhD students. The wife of the lead character has been working for ten frustrating years on her math thesis. In the end it turns out that she committed the murder. However, she gets away with it, finishes her PhD, and lives happily ever after.

**Proof** (2005): Gwyneth Paltrow plays a troubled mathematician, coming to terms with the death of her troubled and famous mathematician father, in whose shadow she has been living. Toward the end of the movie it turns out that she came up with her own major piece of research, outshining the work of her father.

**She Wrote the Book** (1946): A woman math professor lectures about the radius of convergence of power series. In another very funny scene she discusses whether she likes bridges and applies (correctly!) the law of tangents.

**Shrieker** (1998): One of the main characters is Clark, a female math student specializing in "multidimensional topography."

**Smilla's Sense of Snow** (1997): Smilla does mathematical research on snow and ice. At one point she says to a child: "A point is that which cannot be divided. A line is a length without a breadth. This can't possibly interest you."

**Spaceways** (1953): The crew of the rocket ship includes Dr. Lisa Frank, a "higher mathematician" who "has everything, including emotions, neatly reduced to equations and theorems."

**Teresa's Tattoo** (1994): Teresa is doing a PhD in applied math. In a number of funny scenes, she tries and fails to communicate her work to nonmathematicians.

#### **20.3 Interesting Math Teachers and Classroom Scenes**

There are a many, many movies featuring math teachers. Here is a list of movies with teachers or classroom scenes that are particularly notable.

**Au Revoir Les Enfants** (1987): A teacher discusses the fact that for a quadrilateral circumscribed around a circle, the sum of two opposite sides equals the sum of the remaining sides (figure 20.2).

**Fig. 20.2** The sum of two opposite sides equals the sum of the remaining sides.

**Bedazzled** (2000): Elizabeth Hurley plays a devil-teacher, denouncing Fermat's last theorem as useless.

**The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells** (2001): The Pyecraft episode in this miniseries is a fun fantasy about a gentle mathematician working as a math teacher.

**Lambada** (1990): _Stand and Deliver_ with dirty dancing. Blade is a supercool math teacher who inspires his students. Most memorable cheesy scene: Blade demonstrates the usefulness of math by making a near impossible three-cushion pool shot using "the rectangular coordinate system" and a protractor.

**Little Man Tate** (1991): A movie featuring two mathematical prodigies. In one classroom scene a math teacher writes the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 on the blackboard and asks: "Who can tell me how many of these numbers are divisible by two?" One of the prodigies offhandedly answers: "Um, all of them."

**Lucky Pierre** (1974): The DVD of this French comedy comes without subtitles. But you don't have to understand a word to enjoy the hilarious scene where Pierre Richard plays a manic teacher giving a math lesson.

**The Man Without a Face** (1993): Mel Gibson as a scary math teacher quizzes a boy on Pythagoras's theorem, and teaches him a Euclidean theorem on how to find the center of a circle: he goofs it!

**Mean Girls** (2004): A great movie for math spotting on blackboards. The main character is a very pretty girl (Lindsay Lohan) who is also very good at math. Encouraged by her teacher and against the advice of her friends ("social suicide"), she joins the school math club and wins the big math competition for them.

**Merry Andrew** (1958): Danny Kaye plays a math teacher who teaches Pythagoras's theorem by singing and dancing.

**My Teacher's Wife** (1995): The math teacher in question is nicely evil, and his smart and pretty wife has a PhD in math.

**The Prince and the Pauper** (1990): Mickey Mouse as the prince has to sit through a very boring trigonometry lesson.

**Rushmore** (1998): The movie begins with a dream sequence in which a mathematical underachiever fantasizes that he becomes the class hero, by solving a superdifficult math problem. The problem shown is to calculate the area of an ellipse, which is actually pretty easy.

**The School of Rock** (2003): Jack Black is intent upon teaching his students rock music. When surprised by the principal, he improvises a very funny math song.

**Six Feet Under: "Brotherhood"** (2001): This episode includes a class scene, culminating in the math teacher's head exploding.

**Stand and Deliver** (1988): A terrific movie about the legendary math teacher Jaime Escalante motivating his students in a poor school in East Los Angeles. See chapter 3.

**The Virgin Suicides** (1999): We see some teaching of Venn diagrams. One of the blackboards is adorned with a messed-up decimal expansion of _π_. In another scene we see a blackboard with problems related to finding the derivative of a quadratic function.

**Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory** (1971): Some funny scenes involving percentages. One has a teacher using Wonka Bars to teach percentages. Another has a total of 105%. A computer is programmed to find golden tickets based on the "computonian law of probability."

**Wish Upon a Star** (1996) features a funny and sarcastic math teacher.

**The Wonder Years** (1988–1993): Season 3 features a few episodes with Mr. Collins, a seemingly cold but very dedicated math teacher. A truly great character.

#### **20.4 Wizkids**

**Antonia's Line** (1995): A movie about a wunderkind who becomes a mathematician. There are wunderkind calculations, and a homological algebra lecture with commutative diagrams on the blackboards.

**Dear Brigitte** (1965): People want to use a young boy's mathematical abilities to gamble on the horses, but all he wants is to meet Brigitte Bardot. He gets his wish.

**Eustice Solves a Problem** (2004): A terrific short film, set around a children's quiz program in 1958. Eustice is a little boy who knows all the answers.

**Good Will Hunting** (1997): Movie about a math prodigy with tons of mathematics. See chapter 1.

**Little Man Tate** (1991): A movie featuring two mathematical prodigies. Lots of math: math competitions, building tensegrity icosahedra (figure 20.3), and so on.

**Fig. 20.3** Fred builds himself a tensegrity icosahedron in _Little Man Tate_.

**Mercury Rising** (1993): features an autistic boy who is a wiz at cracking ciphers. There are other movies that feature autistic people with strong mathematical abilities in the genius category: _Rain Man_ (1988), _Cube_ (1997), _Mozart and the Whale_ (2005), and _The X Files: "Roland"_ (1994).

**Raising Genius** (2004): This movie contains the most annoying math character of all time. The monumentally whiny Hal is a prodigy who has locked himself in the bathroom to do his math (partial differential equations). And to ogle Lacy, the practicing cheerleader over the fence (Danica McKellar). He refuses to come out ("I can't leave my Lipschitz conditions") and gets annoyed at Lacy's repeated losing the beat on "seven." At the end, he realizes that the "Lacy perturbation" is the key to solving his equations.

**Real Genius** (1985): A movie about a child prodigy. The running joke in the movie involves three consecutive math lectures in which more and more students are replaced by recording devices. In the last scene even the lecturer is replaced by a recording.

**Rushmore** (1998): The movie begins with a dream sequence in which a mathematical underachiever fantasizes that he becomes the hero of the class, by solving a superdifficult math problem. The problem shown is to calculate the area of an ellipse, which is quite routine.

**Star Trek: The Next Generation** (1987–1994): Wesley Crusher, the most annoying character in _Star Trek_ , definitely fits the description of a wizkid. For example, in the episode "The Vengeance Factor" (1989), he does homework which involves the "locally Euclidean metrization of a _k_ -fold contravariant Riemannian tensor field."

**Village of the Damned** (1960): Creepy blond children learn things quickly, including some relativity equations.

**Young Einstein** (1988): A quirky comedy, where Albert Einstein grows up on an apple farm in Tasmania and rediscovers Newton's theories. He later moves to a great city, falls in love with Marie Curie, and discovers everything else that the (real) Albert Einstein is famous for.

#### **20.5 Mathematicians and Murder**

So you're one of those stereotypical, highly strung mathematicians, and something or somebody has just sent you over the edge. How to get even with this special someone and the world in general? If you're looking for some clues in the movies you'll be disappointed. There is no shortage of murderous mathematicians, but despite being smart they don't seem to go about their murderous business in particularly smart ways. In fact, all but one in our list get caught.

**The Adding Machine** (1969): A counting-obsessed accountant named Zero commits a murder.

**Bianca** (1984): The movie features a murderous math teacher, who also doesn't know his magic squares.

**Brutal** (2007): A movie about a mild-mannered science teacher who uses flowers and Fibonacci numbers to plan his gruesome murders (figure 20.4). An awful movie, but the main math scene is pure gold.

**Fig. 20.4** The Fibonacci murderer is about to strike again in _Brutal_.

**Casino Royale** (2006): M identifies the villain Le Chiffre (whose name roughly translates as "digit") as a mathematical prodigy.

**City Homicide: "Hot House"** (2010): Some disgruntled ex-students arrange to kill some mathematicians. The bodies are covered by equations. See chapter 8.

**Class Action** (1991): An actuarial bean counter shows why it is cheaper to deal with lawsuits than to fix a deadly fault in some cars.

**Colossus: The Forben Project** (1970): Colossus is a supercomputer placed in charge of running America. It uses mathematics to establish communication with its Russian counterpart and then decides to take over the world, murdering a few people in the process.

**Death of a Cyclist** (1955): The cyclist dies after being run over by a math professor. The movie features cycloids as well as cyclists.

**Diabolique** (1996): Sharon Stone, as a murderous math teacher, is doing simple algebra in class and is trying to drive her victim mad.

**Der Elefant: "Liebesbrief eines Toten"** (2004): A math student was murdered 20 years ago, and a fellow student, now professor, is a suspect. One of the detectives apparently understands the math: "The arithmetic mean of omega plus 1.23 to the power of phi equals the limit of the inverse function lambda and the square root of _k_ , whereby _k_ must be a constant. Simple." "Sure. For someone who never had any friends in school."

**Fermat's Room** (2007): A mathematician who succeeded in proving the Goldbach conjecture concocts an evil plan to prevent another mathematician from publishing first. The centerpiece of this plan is a deadly trap consisting of a shrinking room and four mathematician captives. See chapter 7.

The idea is to show that under the Ricci flow, positive curvature tends to spread outwards, uh, until at infinite time, the manifold will achieve constant curvature. Now let us consider a generalization of this, the form _F_ is a nice, smooth function. Even in this state the flow will develop singularities in finite time. But, by using a local version of the Gromov compactness theorem, I've been able to get a model of all possible singularities."

**My Teacher's Wife** (1995): The opening titles feature lots of integrals in the background. In one of the first scenes, the mean teacher comments on the outcome of a calculus test: "Calculus is not for wimps."

**Rushmore** (1998): The movie begins with a dream sequence in which a mathematical underachiever fantasizes that he becomes the hero of the class, by solving a superdifficult math problem. The problem shown is to calculate the area of an ellipse, which is a pretty easy calculus exercise; see figure 21.8.

**Fig. 21.8** Working on the "hardest geometry equation in the world" in _Rushmore_.

**The Seven-Per-Cent Solution** (1976): Sherlock Holmes: "The only time Professor Moriarty really occupied the role of my nemesis was when it took him three weeks to make clear to me the mysteries of elementary calculus."

**She Wrote the Book** (1946): A woman math professor lectures about the radius of convergence of complex power series.

**Stand and Deliver** (1988): A great movie about the legendary math teacher Jaime Escalante, motivating his students in a poor school in East Los Angeles. At some point Escalante decides to prepare the class for the Advanced Placement mathematics exam, which consists primarily of calculus. In the movie he shows his students how to calculate the volume of surfaces of revolution, integration by parts, and so on. See chapter 3.

**Strangers on a Train** (1951): A Hitchcock movie, which includes a very funny scene with a drunk mathematician discussing calculus.

**Torn Curtain** (1966): A Hitchcock movie in which Paul Newman plays an American scientist supposedly defecting to the East. Great scene where the mathematical theories are competing with lots of differential equations on blackboards.

#### **21.14 Infinity**

See also list 21.15 on paradoxes, list 21.6 on topology, as well as the entries featuring the phrase "parallel lines never meet" in list 21.4 on geometry. Also check out chapter 16 ("To Infinity and Beyond").

**Alien Hunter** (2003): The main character is an expert cryptanalyst. Very funny blooper involving the chances of something being 99 to the infinite—but not 100.

**The Bank** (2001): A math prodigy takes revenge on a bank. Tons of math. The infinity sign appears in several scenes. In particular, in one scene the infinity sign appears on the screens of the computers of the bank, signalling that the losses of the bank have just gone beyond what the computers can display.

**A Beautiful Mind** (2001): A movie about the brilliant mathematician John Nash. A beautiful scene, where Nash rides his bicycle in the form of an infinity sign; see figure 16.7.

**Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey** (1991): Bill and Ted (Keanu Reeves) run into Colonel Oats, who makes them do infinity push-ups. They contemplate whether it might be possible if they are allowed to do them girly style.

**Drowning by Numbers** (1988): In this Peter Greenaway movie we see a girl counting from 1 to 100 while jumping rope. She is actually counting stars and stops at 100 because "once you've counted 100, all the other hundreds are the same." Signs counting from 1 to 100 appear throughout the movie.

**Forbidden Planet** (1956): Dr. Morbius has mastered the language of an extinct civilization. At one point he illustrates very nicely their immense power resources, showing off a huge exponentially calibrated sequence of meters.

**Hotel Hilbert** (1996): David Hilbert's vision of infinities is brought to life in this brilliant educational film. The movie features a version of Zeno's arrow paradox, Thompson lamps, an Archimedes-like character counting all the grains of sand in the world, and many other puzzles of infinity.

**Infinity** (1996): A movie about Richard Feynman, featuring a very interesting discussion of infinity.

**The Mirror Has Two Faces** (1996): A romantic comedy about a math professor who is dragged out of his shell. At one point, frustrated by a student, he exclaims: "Don't you know that it is possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still have an infinite number of elements left over?"

**Moebius** (1996): A subway train goes missing in the subway network of Buenos Aires. A topologist is called in to investigate. He concludes that the new section is acting like a Möbius band (whatever that means) and remarks upon the newly infinite nature of the subway network (whatever that means).

**The Phantom Tollbooth** (1970): When Milo visits Digitopolis, its ruling Mathemagician convinces him of the infinity of numbers by adding 1 again and again. Earlier, the Mathemagician sings a version of Zeno's paradox, suggesting that Milo keep dividing his troubles in 2 until they disappear.

**_π_** (1998): The mathematical prodigy Max is looking for patterns in nature, the stock market, and the infinite decimal expansion of _π_. In one scene a little girl asks him to divide seventy-three by twenty-two. His answer: "Three point three one eight one eight one eight..." His voice trails off into the distance as he keeps walking down the stairs. He keeps saying "one" on one step and "eight" on the next,—a very nice portrayal of the infinite decimal expansion of this number. See chapter 4.

**The Saragossa Manuscript** (1965): Some noblemen ponder the nature of infinity.

**Star Trek: "Wolf in the Fold"** (1967): Spock cures a computer possessed by an alien, by commanding it to calculate _π_ to the last digit.

#### **21.15 Paradoxes**

Also see the various paradoxical Escher-like constructs contained in list 21.6 on topology.

##### **Liar Paradox and Puzzle**

**Bedazzled** (1967): Peter Cook, as the devil, explains to Dudley Moore that everything he's ever said to him is a lie. A very funny display of the liar paradox.

**The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser** (1974): A pompous professor presents Kaspar Hauser with a misworded version of the liar puzzle: given one question, how do you tell whether a person is a truthteller or a liar? Kaspar's simple and hilarious solution is to ask the person if they are a tree-frog. The professor is not amused.

**Fermat's Room** (2007): Four mathematicians are trapped in a shrinking room that can only be stopped from shrinking by solving a number of puzzles. The liar puzzle is one of the problems that the mathematicians have to solve. See chapter 7.

**Labyrinth** (1986): A fun fantasy version of the liar puzzle: deciding which of two doors to choose when one is guarded by a truthteller and one by a liar.

##### **Zeno's Paradoxes**

**I.Q.** (1994): Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins provide a romantic illustration of one of Zeno's paradoxes; see page 180.

**Jam Films 2: Armchair Theory** (1994): In a fantasy sequence we see one Japanese warrior shoot an arrow at a second warrior who is running away, illustrating another of Zeno's paradoxes: when the arrow has reached the point at which the second warrior was when the arrow was fired he has already moved to a second point, when the arrow reaches that point he has moved to a third point, and so on (figure 21.9).

**Fig. 21.9** Zeno's paradox, as a warrior fleeing an arrow in _Armchair Theory_.

**The Phantom Tollbooth** (1970): When Milo visits Digitopolis, its ruling Mathemagician convinces him of the infinity of numbers by adding 1 again and again. Earlier, the Mathemagician sings a version of one of Zeno's paradoxes, suggesting that Milo keep dividing his troubles in 2 until they disappear.

##### **Self-Reference**

**The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells** (2001): The Pyecraft episode in this mini-series is a fun fantasy about a gentle mathematician Pyecraft. At some point Pyecraft notes that: "There is actually nothing very interesting about the number 39. But of course when one thinks about it in this way makes it an especially interesting number, because it is the smallest number having the property." "The smallest number having the property of being uninteresting. So, it's interesting and uninteresting at the same time."

#### **21.16 Probability, Gambling, and Percentages**

**12 Angry Men** (1957): Probability is used by a jury member to cast doubt on the accused's guilt.

**Aces** (2006): Math majors, one with the alias "Theorem Girl," spend the summer playing poker. Their probability isn't quite right.

**A-Ducking They Did Go** (1939): The three stooges have a funny one-liner on percentages.

**Alien Hunter** (2003): The main character is an expert cryptanalyst. This movie includes a funny blooper involving the chances of something being 99 to the infinite—but not 100.

**The Arrival** (1996): There is a very funny blooper involving an incorrect way to add percentages.

**The Bridge on the River Kwai** (1957): "If you make one [parachute] jump you've got 50% chance of injury. If you make two, 80%, and three you are bound to catch a packet.—Go ahead and jump and hope for the best," Response from the jumper: "With or without parachute?"

**Chicago** (2002): "In 47 years, Cook County ain't never hung a woman yet. So, the odds are 47 to 1 that they won't hang you."

**Class Action** (1991): An actuarial bean-counter shows why it is cheaper to deal with lawsuits than to fix a deadly fault in some cars.

**Jason X** (2001): A cute android named Kay-Em calculates the probability of the team's survival at 12%. After her friend Tsunaron kisses her, she calculates the odds at 53%. He suggests they try for 100%.

**Las Vegas Shakedown** (1955): A math teacher travels to Las Vegas to do research for her book, which is supposed to show that the casinos always win (duh). Some humorous lines about a companion's gambling system.

**Loser Takes All!** (2003): A math teacher claims to have found a system for predicting the lottery and he proves it by winning the jackpot twice. An expert gambler with a perfect memory is called in by the police to find out what is going on. A fun movie with lots of math, gambling, and mathematically minded people.

**Magic Town** (1947): Somebody locates the ideal town for polling: its population thinks exactly like America as a whole.

**My Little Chickadee** (1940): A very funny one-liner from W. C. Fields about whether poker is a game of chance: "Not the way I play it, no."

**Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead** (1990): Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have a coin come up heads 157 times in a row. As they keep tossing the coin, they discuss what this means.

**The Rules of Attraction** (2002): A very funny scene where a girl decides that wearing two condoms is 196% safe.

**Sex and the City: "Old Dogs, New Dicks"** (1999): "Hey. If 85% aren't circumcised, that means I've only slept with 15% of the population. Tops." "Wow. You're practically a virgin."

**Threshold: "Outbreak"** (2006): The mathematician Ramsey is "determining the corresponding probability characteristics of a system of random variables" (by asking people in a market how many tomatoes they just bought and how many people make up their family.)

**Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory** (1971): Some funny scenes involving percentages. One has a teacher using Wonka Bars to teach percentages. Another has a total of 105%, and a computer is programmed to find golden tickets based on the "computonian law of probability."

#### **21.17 Famous Formulas, Identities, and Magic Squares**

Also check out list 21.3 on Pythagoras's theorem and Fermat's last theorem for _a_ 2 \+ _b_ 2 = _c_ 2 and _x n_ \+ _y n_ = _z n_ and chapter 14 ("Pythagoras and Fermat Go to the Movies").

##### **1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 5**

1 + 1 = 2 is one of the identities floating around in the strange mathematical world that Homer stumbles into in _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer3" (1995). A person is brainwashed into believing that 2 + 2 = 5 in _1984_ (1984), and in _Ball of Fire_ (1941) academics argue over whether the correct grammar is "two and two is five" or "two and two are five." In _The Gambler_ (1974) 2 + 2 = 5 is used as a metaphor for the gambler's belief that he can overcome the odds. In _The Road to Hong Kong_ (1962) Bing Crosby tests Bob Hope's memory by asking him what 2 + 2 is. Finally, the gangster movie _Force of Evil_ (1948) features an accountant called Two and Two, who is great at mental arithmetic.

##### **Times Tables**

In _Colossus: The Forben Project_ (1970) two supercomputers are figuring out a way to communicate with each other—starting with the times tables. In _Box of Moon Light_ (1996) a very nerdy father prescribes gigantic flash cards to his son for learning the times tables. In _Fahrenheit 451_ (1966), schoolchildren drone the nine times table. Some singing of times tables can also be admired in _Calabuch_ (1956).

##### **_e πi_ \+ 1 = 0**

Euler's identity, one of the most beautiful in mathematics, is one of the identities floating around in the strange mathematical world that Homer stumbles into in _The Simpsons_ episode "Homer3" (1995). _The Professor and His Beloved Equation_ (2006) is a beautiful movie, the story of a mathematics professor who only remembers things for a short time. He likes perfect and amicable numbers and his favorite equation is Euler's identity.

**sin 2 _θ_ \+ cos2 _θ_ = 1**

This identity makes an appearance in _Lambada_ (1990).

##### **Quadratic Formula**

The quadratic formula is one that the hero learns from a machine in _Battlefield Earth_ (2000). In _Love, Math and Sex_ (1997) the wizkid applies this formula on several occasions. The quadratic formula is mentioned in the famous math song in _The Pirates of Penzance_ (1983) "I am the very model of a modern Major-General... I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical. I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical. About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o'news..." In the _Family Guy_ episode "Let's Go to the Hop" (2000) there is a flashback to a pilgrim correctly reciting the quadratic formula. She is praised; then, being a girl who can answer math problems, she is declared a witch.

##### **Binomial Formula**

The famous math song in _The Pirates of Penzance_ (1983) mentioned above also contains the binomial formula. While the kids are making out in _Schoolgirl_ _Report 4_ (1972), the mathematically minded viewer will be sidetracked by the binomial formula on the blackboard.

##### **Magic Squares**

_Bianca_ (1984) has a classroom scene with Dürer's famous magic square as the centerpiece. This special magic square also appears in the background in one of the scenes in _Münchhausen_ (1943). In the kung fu flick _Brave Archer 3_ (1981), the properties of magic squares are explained by the heroine using the usual 3 × 3 magic square. She also uses these properties to complete a 10 × 10 magic square (figure 21.10).

**Fig. 21.10** Two magic squares in Chinese characters from _Brave Archer 3_ , and one from _Bianca_. In the 10 × 10 magic square all the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to 505. In the movie, the circled 63 is mistakenly drawn as a second 62.

##### **The Circumference and Area of a Circle**

The latter allows Tom Hanks in _Cast Away_ (2000) to calculate the circular area that his rescuers will have to search. In the Pyecraft episode of _The_ _Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells_ (2001), the hero is a seriously overweight mathematician. When he is talking about the circumference of the circle, with the relevant formula displayed on the blackboard, his pupils make fun of his "circumference." See also figure 18.3. In _π_ (1998) the mathematical prodigy Max is looking for patterns in nature, in the stock market, and in _π_. While pondering _π_ Max writes both formulas on a piece of newspaper. In _Red Planet Mars_ (1952), a boy biting into a piece of pie has the idea of using the decimal expansion of _π_ to communicate with aliens. His reasoning is that for the aliens to be able to build a radio dish they have to know the ratio of the diameter to the circumference, _π_.

##### **The Volume of a Sphere**

This can be found in the Pyecraft episode of _The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells_ (2001) as well as in _St. Trinians_ (2007). In both movies the volume formula is given incorrectly as _πr_ 3. See figure 18.3.

#### **21.18 Mathematical Games**

**21** (2008): A math professor organizes some of his students into a team of blackjack players. The Monty Hall puzzle has a large scene.

**A Beautiful Mind** (2001): A movie about the brilliant mathematician John Nash. In the extras on the DVD, there are some deleted scenes in which Nash is talking about the game of Hex, which the real John Nash invented.

**Last Year at Marienbad** (1961): A pretentious movie, which uses the mathematical game of Nim in an absurd manner. The starting position in this movie is always four rows of matchsticks. The rows are of sizes 1, 3, 5, and 7. A move is to take any number of matchsticks from one row only, removing them from the game. The game ends when the last object is taken. The player who takes the last object loses the game. With the particular starting position in _Marienbad_ , the player who moves second can always force a win. A Nim-like game is also played by the detective and the mathematician murderer in the much more fun _Furuhata Ninzaburõ:_ "Murder of a Mathematician" (1995).

**_π_** (1998): The mathematical prodigy Max is looking for patterns in nature and in the stock market. He and his former supervisor are playing Go together, and Max uses the predictability of end games in this complex game to argue that there might be a pattern in similarly complex systems such as nature, the stock market, or the digits of _π_.

**Teen Patti** (2010): A weird Bollywood version of _21_ (2008). Professor Subramaniam has some theory of randomness, and he and his students apply it to win at Teen Patti (basically three-card poker). The professor gives an awful and incorrect explanation of the Monty Hall problem (where the door to be opened is chosen randomly).

 This is a famous though apocryphal story, with Nobel's fellow Swede Gösta Mittag-Leffler usually assigned the role of offending mathematician. It is true that there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics, but there is no evidence that the lack of such a prize is due to Nobel having animosity toward Mittag-Leffler, or any mathematician, for any reason.
 O'Donnell is referring to the two common ways of writing an integral: ∫ _f_ ( _x_ ) d _x_ and ∫ _f_. The former notation is common in school and undergraduate classes, and in more applied areas of mathematics, while pure mathematicians tend to use the latter notation.
 This refers to Parseval's theorem, visible on the bottom of the right blackboard in figure 1.2. This and the other math on the blackboards is part of what is usually referred to as _Fourier analysis_.
 O'Donnell's source for this set of problems was P. W. Kasteleyn, Graph theory and crystal physics, in _Graph Theory and Theoretical Physics_ , ed. Frank Harary (Academic Press, New York, 1967), 63–65.
 In case you're wondering where this formula comes from, here is a clue. Apply the formula   to the formal sum   and you get (don't worry about the details) ((1 − _Az_ )−1) _ij_. Now, apply Cramer's rule to calculate the matrix inverse.
 Eigenvalues, often represented by the Greek letter _λ_ , are special numbers associated with square matrices. They are visible on the blackboards in figure 1.5.
 F. Harary and G. Prins, The number of homeomorphically irreducible trees, and other species, _Acta Mathematica_ 101 (1959), 141–162. See, in particular, page 150 and Appendix II on page 161.
 This refers to the first diagram in the middle row of the blackboard in figure 1.6.

 The source for this question was J. W. Moon, Counting labeled trees, in _Lectures delivered to the Twelfth Biennial Seminar of the Canadian Mathematical Congress_ (Vancouver, 1969), Canadian Mathematical Monographs 1 (Canadian Mathematical Congress, Montreal, 1970). See, in particular, the summary on page 3. The list of graphs on page 2 was also one of the items that O'Donnell had earmarked for use on the blackboard in this scene.
 This is an example taken from R. Brualdi, _Introductory Combinatorics_ (third edition) (Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1999), 514.
 The sources for the graphs and "complicated" equations that the simple "new" thing is overthrowing were inspired by material from the book by J. W. Moon referenced in footnote 9 on page 14: in particular, pages 58 and 59; and, from J. W. Moon, Graphical enumeration problems, in _Graph Theory and Theoretical Physics_ , ed. Frank Harary (Academic Press, London, 1967), 1–41.

 The problem Bayer is referring to can be seen in figure 2.2. The subset that gets removed from  3 is denoted by _X_.
 Another scene in which David Bayer's name is playfully mentioned is when John says 'Papers in hand, Mr. Bayer' to one of the students exiting his classroom.
 The _Riemann hypothesis_ is one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. It is concerned with the zeros of the so-called _Riemann zeta function_. It is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize problems. Proving that the Riemann hypothesis is true would give major insights into the distribution of prime numbers. See figures 2.5 and 2.6 for more details about the zeta function, and the connection between the Riemann hypothesis and prime numbers.

 The expression 1.4142135623... is the start of the well known infinite decimal expansion of  . Another way of writing  , familiar to mathematicians if not more generally, is the infinite

All real numbers can be expressed as both decimal numbers and continued fractions. The continued fraction expansion of a number is actually the more natural, usually telling mathematicians a lot more about the number.
 The quaternions are numbers that extend the complex numbers similarly to the way in which the complex numbers extend the real numbers. The idea that Bayer is putting into Nash's mind is in a sense very natural: a problem that is difficult when expressed in terms of complex numbers may turn out to be much simpler when thought of in terms of quaternions. This process of "simplifying by generalizing" is very common in mathematics. A famous example is the solution of polynomial equations in terms of complex rather than real numbers.
 This is a similar idea to that mentioned in the previous footnote, regarding the quaternion numbers. The new "numbers" here are the so-called _finite fields_. If you succeed in finding the solution in the new setting of finite fields, you can then hope to solve, or at least gain insight into, the original problem.
 The following is a variation of a game that Robert Osserman mentions in his conversation with Sylvia Nassar and David Bayer; see footnote 3.

 The probability   is the unique solution between 0 and 1 of the equation

1 · (1 − _p_ )2 = 4 · _p_ 2.

Then, if each of the players plays 1 finger with probability _p_ and 2 fingers with probability 1 − _p_ , the expected winnings of each player are   per play of the game:

$1 · (1 − _p_ )2 _p_ \+ $4 · _p_ 2(1 − _p_ ) = $0.44.

If then just one of the players changes his probability from _p_ to _q_ , it is easy to see that this player's average winnings will remain the same:

$1 · (1 − _p_ )2 _q_ \+ $4 · _p_ 2(1 − _q_ ) = $0.44.

This confirms that we are actually dealing with a Nash equilibrium.
 In the movie, John's friend and competitor is Martin Hansen, who is modeled on the famous mathematician John Milnor.

 One attempt at a mathematical interpretation can be found in Lynne M. Butler's review of _A Beautiful Mind_ in the _Notices of the American Mathematical Society_ ; see footnote 6.
 A commutator of two "numbers" _α_ and _β_ is simply the expression _αβ − βα_. If both numbers are real numbers, then this commutator is always equal to 0, because real numbers "commute." However, there are other types of numbers in mathematics (for example, the quaternions that we mentioned earlier) that may not commute. So the commutator of such numbers could be different from 0. The commutator then "measures" how far away the two numbers are from commuting.
 In fact, John Nash discusses this in a conversation with Ron Howard included on the DVD.
 If the speeds of the bicycles are not the same, the same ideas still work. However, the calculations are messier, involving two geometric sums.

 This method also makes it obvious that the final answer does not depend upon the individual speeds of the bicycles, only the sum of their speeds.

 John von Neumann also appears briefly as a character in _Race for the Bomb_ (1987).
 The Advanced Placement Program is a scheme by which students in the United States can gain university credit for study undertaken in high school. The AP subjects are usually taught at school, but the exams are administered and independently assessed by the College Board, who are effectively the villains in _Stand and Deliver_.

 For a clear and thoughtful telling of the story, see Jay Matthews, _Escalante: The Best Teacher in the World_ (Henry Holt, New York, 1988).

 Rare among human spirit movies, _Stand and Deliver_ doesn't make us embarrassed to write "human spirit."
 The _Columbo_ -like detective _Furuhata Ninzaburõ_ performs a similar fingerman trick, computing 7 × 8 = 56 to introduce the episode "Murder of a Mathematician" (1995).
 For a lovely exposition of the history of zero, see Robert Kaplan, _The Nothing That Is_ (Penguin, London, 1999).
 The director's shooting script includes deleted scenes, containing more math. At the time of writing, this script was freely available from various websites. Highly recommended reading.
 Are you thinking of memorizing a couple of hundred digits of the decimal expansion of _π_ but are unsure where to stop? If so, we recommend memorization to the 767th decimal place. If you do this, you will be able to finish reciting your expansion proudly and correctly with "... nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, and so on." These six consecutive 9s are sometimes called the Feynman point, named after the famous physicist Richard Feynman, who once remarked on the humorous "application" of this curiosity.
 D. H. Baily, P. B. Borwein, and S. Plouffe, On the rapid computation of various poly-logarithmic constants, _Mathematics of Computation_ 66 (1997), 903–913.

 The movie _π_ is definitely not the only one that gets it wrong. Just about every movie character who tries to recite or display more than a few digits of _π_ seems to be doomed to fail; see chapter 18 ("Money-Back Bloopers") for details.

 A bit of trivia: The first song on the soundtrack (written by Clint Mansell) has the title " _πr_ 2," and the last song is "2 _πr_."

 Is there anybody who still takes The Bible Code seriously? If so, they should be directed to the very funny and thoroughly debunking website of the Australian computer scientist Brendan McKay. There, they can learn of the hidden messages in _Moby Dick_.
 At a later point, Max begins this calculation. He calls the short side of the golden rectangle _A_ and the long side _A_ \+ _B_. Then the defining relation of a golden rectangle translates into the equation

or equivalently

After substituting   and multiplying both sides by _φ_ , this equation turns into a quadratic equation. Doing the familiar _b_ 2 − 4 _ac_ stuff, we find that the positive solution to this equation is

 However, this particular link is weaker than first appears. Replace the two 1s at the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence by your two favorite positive numbers, and generate a sequence of numbers using the same Fibonacci addition rule. Then the ratio of consecutive numbers in this new sequence will also approach the golden ratio.
 For a well-written and accessible account of these ideas, see Mario Livio's excellent book _The Golden Ratio_ (Broadway, New York, 2003).

 For an excellent account separating fact from fiction, see Mario Livio's book referred to above in footnote 10.

 A similar spiral drawing appears in _The Giant Claw_ (1957), when the heroes try to determine the path of the chicken monster.
 For an excellent movie about one man's obsession with one particular number, watch Jim Carrey's _The Number 23_ (2007). A lot of fun, but no math, except for the number 23 appearing over and over and over and over.
 Plateau's Problem: After a wire loop is dipped in soap solution, what is the shape of the soap film that forms? Plateau's Rules: 1. Soap films attach to smooth surfaces at right angles. 2. In a soap bubble cluster, soap films always join along an edge in threes, and the angle between any two such films is 120 degrees. 3. Where edges meet at a point, they always do so in fours, and at the same angle as the four segments joining the center with the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron.
 Actually, no mathematician would ever say this, since it is clearly impossible to list all 216-digit numbers, even for a religious fanatic.
 "Math section" is the term used in the shooting script.
 For a very thorough study, see Walter Burkert, _Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism_ (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1972).

 It is clear that even the ancient Babylonians knew of Pythagoras's theorem, long before Pythagoras. And the earliest known proof of the theorem appears in Euclid's _Elements_ , dating to about 200 years after Pythagoras's death.
 Again, it is not clear whether Pythagoras should really be credited with this discovery.

 By "three-digit number" we're including the possibility that the digits in the hundreds and tens places might be 0. For example, the incinerator thing had prime label 083, for which _a_ = 0.
 We are not told this in the movie, but it is indicated in David Pravica's and Heather Ries's article, referred to in footnote 1.

 See David Pravica and Heather Ries's article referred to in footnote 1.
 When we talked to David Pravica, he suggested that the Cube was _not_ intended to have synchronized room movements.
 The Goldbach conjecture is a very old, very famous, and still unsolved mathematical problem. It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. That is 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 5 + 3, and (so goes the conjecture) so on. The Goldbach conjecture also plays a central role in the murder mystery _Inspector Lewis_ (2006) and in the biopic _Chen Jingrun_ (2001). Jimmy Stewart also plays around with it in _No Highway in the Sky_ (1951). And, in the _Futurama_ episode "The Beast With a Billion Backs" (2008), Farnsworth and Wernstrom collaborate on "another elementary proof."
 We've slightly reworded some of the puzzles, to clarify them and to remove some ambiguities.
 A variation of this puzzle appears as Problem 79 in the Rhind Papyrus dated to around 1650 BC.
 _Cube 2: Hypercube_ (2002) also features a corpse decorated with equations. And in _Believers_ (2007), the leader of a crazy cult has discovered a formula that will transport his followers to a safe place before the apocalypse; the cult members have the formula tattooed on their bodies.
 A very similar plot is the basis of the episode "Bright Boy" of the TV series _Law and Order: Criminal Intent_ (2006).

 Episodes 2.36 and 1.8, respectively.

 W. H. Freeman & Company, London, 1984.

 The claim is made by Mel Watkins in his book _On the Real Side_ (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1994), 163, with a less precise claim appearing in Ronald Smith's _Comedy Stars at 78 RPM_ , (McFarland, 1998), 149. However, neither book cites a reference supporting the claim. We are also unaware of a contemporaneous theatre review that mentions the routine. A discussion of the matter with David Thompson of Agnes Scott College indicates that there is definitely some reason to doubt the claim. David and his colleagues Lyn Schenbeck and Constance Hill have produced a critical edition of the script of _Shuffle Along_ , based upon what are very likely 1921 working copies, one the former property of Flournoy Miller. The scripts and the accompanying annotations give no indication of the routine.

 A loosely related routine appeared soon after, in the Amos 'n Andy movie _Check and Double Check_ (1930). This skit is much simpler but still quite funny.

 Episode 3.4.

 Perhaps an early example of mathematical product placement.
 Mention must be made of the episode "The Prisoner of Benda" (2010) of the TV series _Futurama_. This terrific episode involves the switching of minds between pairs of bodies, which then cannot be directly switched back. At the end of the episode, the Harlem Globetrotters declare that all the minds can be returned to their original bodies, with the assistance of two new bodies. A full proof, specifically worked out for the episode, is displayed in the background.

 There is some factoring of Lie groups in the background of _Codename Icarus_ (1981). And, in case it counts, reference is made to "isomorphic group therapy" in the episode "Trees Made of Glass, Part 2" (2005) of the TV series _Threshold_.
 The snake lemma is just one of a number of catchily named lemmas concerning commutative diagrams. There are also the four lemma, the five lemma, and the 3 × 3 lemma, to name just a few. As with the snake lemma, the names are suggestive of the associated commutative diagrams.
 For a popular account of the classification, see Markus du Sautoy's book, _Symmetry: A Journey into the Patterns of Nature_ (Harper, 2008).

 Eleanor Bergstein was the screenwriter for _It's My Turn_.

 In the original children's story by L. Frank Baum, the Scarecrow wisely refrains from testing out his new brains (made of bran).

 Actually, the Wizard in Baum's story is similarly unimpressed, as clearly is Baum himself, with the whole concept of granting brains to someone. The chapter in which the Scarecrow is brained is titled "The Magic Art of the Great Humbug."

 In _The Simpsons_ episode "$pringfield (or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)" (1993), Homer finds some Henry Kissinger glasses. Deciding that he is now smart, he promptly recites the Scarecrow's Pythagoras line. To his surprise, he receives a response:

_NEARBY MAN: That's a right triangle, you idiot!  
HOMER: D'oh!_
 The lyrics of the song are by Johnny Mercer, more famous for _Moon River_ and _Jeepers Creepers_.
 Sheesh! The movie is actually an extraordinarily tedious lesbian chick flick. However, it did introduce us to the unforgettable expression "She's aardvarking with the hypotenuse."
 Any square multiple of a Pythagorean triple is again a Pythagorean triple. For example, multiplying the previous triple by 22, we find 62 \+ 82 = 102. Here is a simple trick to derive infinitely many Pythagorean triples that are not so related.

Pick a natural number _n_ and consider the identity (2 _n_ \+ 1) + _n_ 2 = ( _n_ \+ 1)2. This will be a Pythagorean triple as long as the odd number 2 _n_ \+ 1 is a square. But that's easy to arrange: just pick any odd square, and then choose _n_ accordingly. For example, the odd square 9 = 32 arises from choosing _n_ = 4, and then the identity can be written as 32 \+ 42 = 52. Similarly, the odd square 25 = 52 (from the choice _n_ = 12) leads to the Pythagorean triple 52 \+ 122 = 132. In fact, all possible Pythagorean triples can be obtained from similar identities.
 And perhaps not. The International Movie Data Base (IMDB) lists a Brazilian musical, _Matemática Zero, Amor Dez_ (1958). We have been unable to determine absolutely anything about this movie, much less obtain a copy.

Looking for a footnote? There isn't one. "Homer3" is actually the title of the episode.
 All the scenes in the three-dimensional world can be experienced in full 3D, as part of the IMAX movie _Cyberworld_ (2000).
 There is obviously no shortage of movies with plots tied to time travel and the like, but there is seldom much explicitly mathematical in the telling. One beautiful movie that gives the sense of time and its irreversibility, as well as containing some clever geometric pondering, is the aptly named _The 4th Dimension_ (2006). There is also the terrific _Futurama_ episode, "The Late Philip J. Fry" (2010), in which Professor Farnsworth, Fry, and Bender accidentally go forward 10,000 years into the future. The professor's time machine cannot go backward in time, and so they are stuck there. They decide to go forward instead, and discover that time loops around, so they arrive back safely (eventually, after a second trip through the loop).
 Similarly stylish looping occurs in _Graveyard Disturbance_ (1987), _Pleasantville_ (1998), _The Avengers_ (1998), _Matrix Revolutions_ (2003), and the _Futurama_ episode "Bender's Game" (2008).
 Jack, the precocious schoolboy in _The 4th Dimension_ (2006), tries this argument out on his teacher. He explains it very well, but she doesn't seem at all impressed.

 A similar explanation can also be found in _Déjà Vu_ (2006).
 It would appear that the four-dimensional man in the movie _4D Man_ (1959) is doing something similar, but it is never really explained. More clearly, in _The Big Bang Theory_ episode "The Pants Alternative" (2010), Sheldon correctly describes how he could take his pants off over his head in a four-dimensional world. Unfortunately, he then attempts it in the regular three-dimensional world.

 If we follow Einstein's instructions, but begin only with the two endpoints of the line segment, then we actually _do_ obtain the hollow hypersphere.
 For a beautiful popularization of mathematics written from this perspective, see John Stillwell, _Yearning for the Impossible_ (A K Peters, Wellesley, MA, 2006).
 Mathematically, we would be describing just as valid a potential infinity if the meters increased according to the sequence 1, 2, 3,... Of course, this slower growth is far less suggestive of the psychological sense of infinity.

 A similar discussion, concerning the infinite collection of prime numbers, appears in _The Mirror Has Two Faces_ (1996); see chapter 11.
 As simple examples, it is clear that we should have _∞_ \+ _∞_ = _∞_ , and _∞_ \+ 0 = _∞_. Difficulties arise if we try to define quantities such as _∞−∞_ , so we simply don't. This pick-and-choose approach is not uncommon. For example, though 0 is a bona fide number, we usually make no attempt to define  
 The feature-length cartoon _The Phantom Tollbooth_ (1970) considers infinity in a similar manner: when Milo visits Digitopolis, its ruling mathemagician convinces Milo of the infinity of numbers by adding 1 again and again. Earlier, the mathemagician sings a version of Zeno's paradox, suggesting that Milo keep dividing his troubles in 2 until they disappear!

 That is, we have demonstrated that an infinite set can be the same size as one of its subsets. This is in fact a much more common introduction to the weirdness of infinite sets, with Feynman's "twice as many numbers as numbers" observation usually an afterthought.

 Consideration of the size of these sets suggests the numerical equation _∞ − ∞_ = _∞_ , to be contrasted with the "natural" _∞ − ∞_ = 0. This demonstrates the fundamental danger with the arithmetic of _∞_ , referred to earlier. Subtraction of _∞_ from _∞_ can mean many different things. So, since we don't have just one meaning for _∞ − ∞_ , we have no better choice than to leave it undefined.
 One source of encouragement for this association of the Möbius band with infinity is the manner in which paper Möbius bands will naturally form the shape of the symbol _∞_. This is charming but is of no particular mathematical importance.
 For explicitly stated confusion on this point, see the writer-director's commentary on _Pleasantville_ (1998).
 Sadly almost all of the expansion is incorrect; see chapter 4 for details. See also _Red Planet Mars_ (1952), where the fundamentally infinite nature of the decimal expansion of _π_ is used to communicate with the "Martians."
 Even if we consider numerical expressions, there are much more elegant ways to represent _π_ than by its decimal expansion. For example, the following is _π_ as an infinite product (discovered by seventeenth century mathematician John Wallis):

 In Paul Auster's excellent novel, upon which the movie is based, the same list of primes is given, except 11 is also omitted. Possibly, Auster and the director just liked the sound of certain primes.
 John Stillwell, a writer of many excellent university textbooks, once received the draft cover for his latest book _Topological Group Theory_ , which read "Topological Group Therapy." Luckily, this mistake was caught before the book was sent off to the printers.
 Regrettably, the movie omits some further dialogue from J. M. Barrie's play. Susan goes on to ask what algebra is: "Is it those three-cornered things?" Phoebe replies: "It is _X_ minus _Y_ equals _X_ plus _Y_ and things like that. And all the time you are saying they are equal, you feel in your heart: why should they be?"
 We have not included Albert Einstein in the list, since he was much more a physicist than a mathematician. And, needless to say, the appearances of this iconic character are too numerous to list.
 Newton is also listed as a character in "The Darking" from _Star Trek: Voyager_ (1997). This episode includes a crowd scene of hologram people, but Newton himself does not seem to appear on camera.
 As well as being an aspiring actress, Danica McKellar is an aspiring mathematician. Her popularizations of mathematics have been well received.
 eBay has been one of our methods of finding obscure math movies, with unpredictable results: we're not always sure what we're buying. In the case of _Schoolgirl Report 4_ , we certainly did not predict that the video would be seized by Australian customs. Confirming with the eBay seller that there was nothing to worry about, we contested the seizure. This led to the film being reviewed by a customs officer. He then agreed to release the video after a short conversation: "You realize that this is a badly dubbed softcore movie from the 70s?" "Yep." "Uh—well, I hope you enjoy it." And we did indeed enjoy the scene with the binomial formula.
