Preface

Special Relativity arises from the need for a textbook at intermediate level, especially in North-American universities. There are nowadays several technological applications of Special Relativity in everyday life, including the GPS system, PET scanners, and other medical instruments. There are plenty of college-level, deliberately watered-down introductions to Special Relativity. These introductions typically serve a Modern Physics course and devote two chapters to the subject. Such short introductions are inadequate for physicists or scientists requiring a modern university course. What is worse, and few teachers will deny that, fundamental aspects of Special Relativity are usually not understood by the students and often not presented by the teachers. The four-dimensional world view is usually introduced only in a very colloquial way while the mathematical formalism of four-vectors and four-tensors, which is necessary to understand and formalize the idea of spacetime, is ignored. Yet, the latter is not so complicated and is accessible to students who have taken a linear algebra course provided that room is made in the relativity course for it. For most students the Modern Physics course is the only introduction to Special Relativity that they receive in their entire curriculum and, as a result, physics and mathematics students (the very ones who must know it) miss this fundamental subject. This knowledge gap is very serious since Special Relativity is, without doubt, one of the great intellectual achievements of mankind, exactly the kind of stuff that a student gets into physics for. From a teacher's logistical point of view, it is also relatively simple in comparison with, e.g., General Relativity or particle physics. Yet, too often the science student is robbed of this part of his or her education by systems too bent on entertainment and student counts. An essential part of the physics curriculum is sacrificed for fear of mathematics.

For students carrying on to a course on General Relativity, perhaps in graduate studies, this problem quickly becomes irrelevant but such students are a minority and physics departments in many small universities do not offer a General Relativity course or offer it infrequently. This situation is too common and it is true that the mathematical background of second- or third-year undergraduates is limited and that the formalism of tensors necessary for the study of Special Relativity needs to be taught in the course. One problem of this rationalization of the curriculum is the lack of a proper textbook on Special Relativity at a level higher than college physics or current Modern Physics courses, yet accessible to undergraduates who are not prepared to tackle General Relativity textbooks or Special Relativity classics such as Wolfgang Rindler's Introduction to Special Relativity .

Another complication is that, in an elementary course in Special Relativity, typical undergraduates have not yet taken a serious course in electromagnetism and do not yet master the Maxwell equations. Therefore, the usual textbook approach using Maxwell's theory as a trampoline for Special Relativity ends up being ineffective for students at this level. In retrospect, although the historical line of thought and the traditional pedagogical approach was electromagnetism first and then Special Relativity, and it is true that Maxwell's theory receives its most elegant and revealing formulation in Special Relativity, the latter is not just electromagnetism pushed to the extreme (this point was stressed early on by Pauli). Although electromagnetism was a useful trampoline to discover relativity, Einstein's 1905 theory is about the unveiling of the four-dimensional nature of the world, spacetime and its Lorentzian geometry, the equivalence of mass and energy, the modified mechanics, and the fundamental symmetries of this theory. The Maxwell field is only one of the possible forms of mass-energy that can live in Minkowski spacetime. This point of view is obvious after one takes a course in General Relativity or particle physics, but it is at odds with the discover-Special-Relativity-through-electromagnetism approach of many textbooks. An axiomatic approach to Special Relativity based on the Principle of Relativity and the constancy of the speed of light seems the best option here—the key physical concepts of the theory (relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction) can be derived easily from these two postulates, and this is the path originally followed by Einstein. A constructive approach would need to be based on electromagnetism and the average undergraduate at this point still views the Maxwell equations as rather abstract or has not seen them at all. It is possible, however, to introduce the Lorentz transformation as the transformation relating inertial frames which leaves electromagnetism invariant without considering explicitly the Maxwell equations. An example showing a simple electromagnetic phenomenon will do, and this is the avenue taken in this book. The Lorentz invariance of the full Maxwell equations can be checked later when the student is familiar with them.

The book begins at an elementary level exposing and discussing in Chap.​ 1 and Chap.​ 2 all the basic concepts normally contained in college-level expositions, including the Lorentz transformation. Then, in Chap.​ 3 , it introduces the student to the four-dimensional world view, making clear that this is implied by the Lorentz transformations mixing time and space coordinates. This is as far as the best Modern Physics textbooks seem to get. In addition, we make use of spacetime diagrams already in this part of the book (as well as, of course, in the following parts) to visualize the relevant discussion. Following this introduction, in Chap.​ 4 , is the part that is avoided in lower-level courses; the formalism of tensors. It is my experience, gained by teaching Special Relativity courses in Canada, that once the student is persuaded that space and time do mix and is motivated by the need to understand the four-dimensional world, and once time is made during the course to explain this part, this chapter goes surprisingly easily and the fear of tensors proves unfounded. Chapter 5 then introduces the essential concept of causality missed in the Modern Physics courses and details the application of the general formalism of tensors to Minkowski space. The following Chap.​ 6 discusses the relativistic mechanics of point particles, four-momentum and four-force, the equivalence between mass and energy, and some applications. Chapter 7 describes relativistic optics and, whenever possible, uses the similarities between the motion of massless and massive particles to facilitate understanding and memorization. An optional short Chap.​ 8 follows, in which measurements in Minkowski spacetime are discussed to dispel the widespread impression that physical observables are coordinate components of four-vectors or four-tensors (and therefore, that all measurements are based on coordinate-dependent components).

Matter in Minkowski spacetime is discussed in Chap.​ 9 . Here the energy-momentum tensor of a continuous distribution of mass-energy and its covariant conservation are introduced, and various (optional) energy conditions are presented. Angular momentum is discussed briefly. This part is followed by a discussion of the scalar field (presented first, as this is the simplest field in theoretical physics), of perfect fluids, and of the Maxwell field (which is now presented as one of the possible energy distributions in Minkowski space, although as an important one describing one of only four fundamental interactions).

For pedagogical reasons, it is easier to work in Cartesian coordinates and all the material introduced thus far (with the exception of the tensor formalism of Chap.​ 4 , which is quite general) is restricted to these coordinates. This restriction facilitates the introduction of the ideas and concepts of Special Relativity, but is too restrictive. At this point, Chap.​ 10 introduces general coordinates, covariant differentiation, and geodesics (the emphasis is on computational skills rather than rigour or proof) and reformulates the previous material in arbitrary coordinate systems using covariant formulas. This chapter could be skipped if short of time during a course.

The mathematics essential to study Special Relativity is relatively simple: some calculus and linear algebra. The real difficulties are conceptual, not mathematical. The beginning student is fighting his or her own physical sense derived by everyday low-speed intuition, which conflicts with the results of Special Relativity. Mathematics is a tool which facilitates understanding and, by banning it from the course, current low-level oversimplified courses preclude the understanding of the basic concepts of the theory. It is much better to allow room for it in the course, although stripping it down to the essential, and then use it rather than paraphrasing it with obscure and wordy discussions which invariably fail to convey the essence of relativity.

Every chapter is supplemented by a section containing practice problems. These exercises constitute an essential part of the textbook and the student is urged to try them. The solution to selected exercises, as well as the numerical answers to others, appears at the end of the book.

For pedagogical purposes, in this book we retain explicitly the speed of light c in the formulas, i.e., we do not set c to unity except in spacetime diagrams and we include several steps in the calculations to facilitate comprehension by the beginner. We avoid the obsolete notions of rest mass and dynamical mass, transversal and longitudinal mass which were popular in old textbooks. Sections marked with an asterisk are optional and can be omitted without jeopardizing the understanding of the material which follows. Exercises referring to optional sections are also marked with an asterisk.

I hope that this book will help many students enjoy the beauty, elegance, and power of Einstein's theory. Have fun!

Abstract

Our everyday experience is about objects moving at speeds much smaller than the speed of light in vacuo,  . Newtonian mechanics was developed to describe phenomena at typical speeds   and fails when speeds are not negligible in comparison with  . This situation is not infrequent; for example, it is relatively easy to accelerate electrons to speeds   in accelerators. However, as their velocities become closer and closer to  , it becomes harder and harder to accelerate these electrons further.

Concepts that have proven useful in ordering things easily achieve such authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable givens.

## 1.1 Introduction

The theory of Special Relativity formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905 [1, 2] is, without doubt, one of the great intellectual achievements of the twentieth century. Our everyday experience is about objects moving at speeds much smaller than the speed of light in vacuo,  . Newtonian mechanics was developed to describe phenomena at typical speeds   and fails when speeds are not negligible in comparison with  . This situation is not infrequent; for example, it is relatively easy to accelerate electrons to speeds   in accelerators. However, as their velocities become closer and closer to  , it becomes harder and harder to accelerate these electrons further. As we will see, it is believed that the speed of light   is a barrier that particles and physical signals cannot break.

The theory of Special Relativity was a one man's work which incorporated previous ideas and contributions (especially those of Poincaré), but in a way that nobody was able to fully grasp before Einstein. 1 To summarize, Special Relativity correctly predicts phenomena for velocities   which are not negligible in comparison with the speed of light, or for  , and it has Newtonian mechanics as its low-velocity limit. Further, it agrees with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism (which predicts electromagnetic waves travelling at speed   in vacuo) and describes physics in the absence of gravity. The class of phenomena modelled by Special Relativity includes the dynamics of particles moving at speeds comparable with  , the slowing down of clocks and the contraction of lengths in moving reference frames, the Doppler effect for electromagnetic radiation, the equivalence of mass and energy illustrated by the "most famous formula of physics"  , and the creation and annihilation of particle/antiparticle pairs. These phenomena have many applications, including particle accelerators, the Global Positioning System (GPS), commercial nuclear reactors, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners used in hospitals, and synchrotron light imaging in industry. Special Relativity has now been tested by countless experiments and is still tested every day in particle accelerators. The merging of Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics produced relativistic Quantum Field Theory, on which the standard model of particle physics is based. Nowadays it is impossible for physicists to conceive of a non-relativistic fundamental theory.2

In our exposition of Special Relativity we will omit gravity from the picture and we will assume that inertial frames extend to spatial infinity. Special Relativity is a theory for a world in which gravity is switched off; the relativistic theory of gravity, General Relativity, contains Special Relativity as the limit for vanishing gravitational fields, and was created by Einstein in 1915. We will not consider General Relativity and gravity in this book, except for some considerations at the end of it.

## 1.2 The Principle of Relativity

Physical phenomena are normally described with respect to a given reference frame, which consists of a set of spatial axes and a set of synchronized clocks with respect to which one measures positions and time intervals. Newton's second law is valid in all inertial frames, which are defined by Newton's first law. According to this law, an inertial frame is one in which a free body (i.e., a body not subject to forces) is not accelerating. Any system moving with constant velocity with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.

The Principle of Newtonian (or Galilean) Relativity states that

the laws of mechanics are invariant under change of inertial frame.

In other words, the outcome of a physical experiment performed in two different inertial frames must be the same; no experiment can detect a difference between the two frames. This statement applies not only to kinematics, but to any kind of (non-gravitational) physics. Therefore, there is no absolute motion through space, and there is no preferred inertial frame.

In pre-relativistic physics, the transformation from one inertial frame to another (change of frame) is given by the Galilei transformation. For simplicity, consider the motion of two inertial frames   and   such that the  , and   Cartesian axes of   are parallel to the  , and   axes of  , respectively, and such that the system   moves along the  -axis with constant velocity   (standard configuration), as in Fig. 1.1. We adopt the convention that the velocity   is positive if the system   is moving away from  .

Fig. 1.1

Two inertial frames   and   in standard configuration

Suppose that you synchronize clocks in the two inertial frames in such a way that the time indicated by a clock in   coincides with the time indicated by a clock in   when the origins of   and   superpose. An inertial observer refers his or her measurements to an inertial coordinate system and a clock.

The Galilei transformation relating two inertial frames   and   in standard configuration is

(1.1)

In Newtonian mechanics, time is assumed to be the same in the two frames and clocks run at the same rate in two inertial frames connected by a Galilei transformation, irrespective of their relative velocity  . The time interval between two events is the same for both observers. (As we will see shortly, in Special Relativity this assumption turns out to be incorrect, which becomes manifest when   is comparable to  . This fact is striking and counterintuitive.)

The inverse of the Galilei transformation is obtained by changing primed and unprimed quantities and by the substitution  , producing

(1.2)

This procedure is intuitive: if   sees   moving away with velocity  , then   sees   moving away with velocity  , a clear application of the Principle of Relativity.

A fact that is familiar from experience is that, in Newtonian mechanics, 3-dimensional lengths are Galilei-invariant, i.e., if   and   are the positions of two points of space and  , then

(1.3)

(the formal proof of this statement is left to the reader as a simple exercise). Physically, Eq. (1.3) means that if a rod has length   in one inertial frame, its length will be measured to be   also in any other inertial frame related to the former by a Galilei transformation, a statement that matches everyday's experience. If   and   ( ) are the Cartesian coordinates of two infinitesimally close points of space, the Euclidean line element

(1.4)

(where   is the Kronecker delta) is invariant under Galilei transformations. The importance of the Galilei transformation in Newtonian mechanics is due to the fact that

Newton's laws are invariant under Galilei transformations

To wit, consider Newton's second law   in an inertial frame  . Is it   also in another inertial frame  ? The answer is affirmative, for

and, since   is a constant,

## 1.3   Groups: The Galilei Group

Transformations acting on a physical system which leave it invariant are called symmetries of that system. For example, a ball is invariant under rotations about an axis passing through its centre (its symmetries). In theoretical physics, symmetries can be much more abstract than rotations, but the idea is still the same: certain mathematical operations are defined which leave the physical system (particle, rigid body, wave, field, etc.) invariant. Usually, the operations used in theoretical physics and acting on a physical (or mathematical) system have a mathematically well-defined structure. The simplest such algebraic structure is a group. Thinking of the symmetry transformations as elements of a set, the mathematical definition of a group follows.

Definition 1.1.

Let   be a (non-empty) set and let   denote an operation in  , i.e., a single-valued map

(1.5)

which associates to a pair of elements   another element of   which is denoted   (the image of the ordered pair   under the operation  ). The important thing is that performing the operation on   and   one obtains as a result an object   which is still an element of   or, in more technical parlance, that   be closed with respect to  .

The pair   is a group if

1.

The operation is associative, i.e.,

(1.6)

2.

There exists a neutral element e such that

(1.7)

3.

Any   has an inverse, i.e.,

(1.8)

In general, the operation   is not commutative, i.e.,  .

Definition 1.2

The group  is Abelian or commutative if the operation   is commutative,  .

Definition 1.3

A subgroup of the group  is a subset   which is itself a group with respect to the operation  .

A subgroup of   must necessarily contain the neutral element   of  .

Example 1.1

The set of integers   is not a group with respect to the addition   because the inverse of any   (which would be  ) does not belong to  .

Example 1.2

The set   is a group with respect to the addition  . It is not a group with respect to the multiplication.

Example 1.3

The set of real numbers   is a group with respect to addition.

Example 1.4

The set of real numbers without the zero   is a group with respect to multiplication.

Example 1.5

The set of real functions  , where   is an interval of  , is a group with respect to the sum of functions defined as

(1.9)

* * *

Let us return to the physics related to the change of inertial frames:

the Galilei transformations form a commutative group with respect to the composition of transformations.

In fact, let g be a Galilei transformation that sends   into   and consider the set G of all Galilei transformations. The composition of Galilei transformations is still a Galilei transformation: if   represents the map   and   represents the map  , we then have that   is

and   is

hence   is still a Galilei transformation and the operation   is commutative.

Let us now check the associativity:

1.

if   is another Lorentz transformation with velocity  ,   acting on   produces

while

produces  , which is identical to the previous expression, hence

(1.10)

2.

Let us check now for the existence of a neutral element (identity). This is obviously the Galilei transformation with zero velocity  , or the map   described by  . It is    .

3.

Finally, let us check for the existence of an inverse. Let g be the Galilei transformation with constant velocity v. Then its inverse   is the transformation with velocity  . In fact,   is given by

so that  .

We conclude that the Galilei transformations form an Abelian group. Since each transformation of this group corresponds to one and only one value of the constant velocity v, it is said that the Galilei transformations form a 1-parameter group. The statement that Newton's laws are invariant under Galilei transformations is rephrased by saying that the Galilei group is the symmetry group of Newtonian mechanics.

Group theory is an abstract branch of mathematics that plays a fundamental role in atomic, molecular, particle, and solid state physics, to the point that the search for new or more general symmetries of the equations describing a physical theory may lead to new discoveries, or may serve as a guide for the formulation of new theories. An important result due to the German mathematician Emmy Noether states that conserved quantities are associated with symmetries (see. e.g., Ref. [5]): this fact makes it very valuable to know the symmetries of a physical system. For the moment, we will content ourselves with the definitions given.

One can consider two consecutive Galilei transformations with velocity vectors   and   that are not parallel, i.e., not in standard configuration. These two transformations commute (i.e., the result does not depend on the order in which the two transformations are applied). The first transformation gives

and, for two such transformations with velocity vectors   and  , it is

## 1.4 Galileian Law of Addition of Velocities

Consider two events separated by an infinitesimal distance   and an infinitesimal time   in two inertial frames   and   in standard configuration. According to the Galilei transformation, we have   (  is constant). The velocity of an object covering the space   in the time   in   is  . The velocity of an object covering   in the time   in   is  , or

(1.11)

(Galileian law of addition of velocities), which agrees with everyday's low-speed intuition. The relative velocity of two particles approaching each other along the same line with speeds   and   (and velocities   and  ) is  , i.e., "velocities add up". For example, two cars moving toward each other at   each will have a relative velocity of  . If Eq. (1.11) were correct for light signals, then the relative velocity of a light beam and an observer approaching the beam would be larger than  . However, in Special Relativity the Galilean transformation formula (1.11) is incorrect and leads to wrong results when applied to electromagnetic waves or to particles moving at relativistic speeds.

(where   is the electric charge density,   is the current density,   is the electric field,   is the magnetic field and cgs Gaussian units are used), summarize the entire theory of electromagnetism, together with the law for the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle of charge  , mass  , and velocity   in electric and magnetic fields

(1.16)

Fig. 1.2

A spherical flash of electromagnetic waves irradiated by a point-like source at the origin at time

It was noted early on that the Maxwell equations are not invariant under Galilei transformations, as one can deduce by checking these equations explicitly. Instead of doing this exercise consider, for illustration, a phenomenon ruled by the Maxwell equations, a spherical flash of electromagnetic waves irradiated by a point-like source and propagating radially outward with speed  . For a pulse emitted at time   at the origin (Fig. 1.2) one has, at the time  , that  , or

(1.17)

in the   inertial frame. But in the inertial frame   moving with constant velocity   with respect to the previous one, it is not  . Instead we have, using Eq. (1.17),

(1.18)

In general, the Maxwell equations and the phenomena that they rule are not Galilei-invariant. Based on the success of Maxwell's theory and on the inconsistence of Newtonian mechanics which, with its forces dependent only on the position of particles, requires an instantaneous action at distance and an infinite propagation speed of interactions, Special Relativity rejects the Galilei transformation and replaces it with the transformation which leaves the Maxwell equations invariant under changes of inertial frame (this is the Lorentz transformation which we are going to see in Chap. ). Newton's theory, which is invariant under Galilei transformations and therefore is incompatible with electromagnetism, is discarded (in the sense that it is only believed to be valid in the limit  ), while Maxwell's theory is retained. After all, the latter correctly predicts electromagnetic waves which, propagating with speed  , are the most relativistic physical entities already well known in Einstein's time.

### 1.5.1 The Ether

Newtonian mechanics is incompatible with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. Consider, for example, two particles interacting at a distance. In Newtonian mechanics, a change in the position of one particle is felt immediately at the position of the second particle, implying an infinite speed of propagation of interactions. By contrast, the electromagnetic interaction between two charges propagates at finite speed   in Maxwell's theory. At the end of the 1800s it was proposed that electromagnetic waves are disturbances of, and propagate in, a medium called luminiferous ether and that   is the speed of these waves with respect to a frame in which the ether is at rest.4 Then, according to Galilei's law of composition of velocities, in any other frame moving with speed   with respect to the ether, the speed of light would be  .

Fig. 1.3

The motion of the earth with respect to the ether at two opposite points of the orbit

Since the earth orbits the sun with a linear speed  , one could regard the earth as a moving frame with respect to the ether and would detect a velocity   instead of   when the earth is at opposite positions in its orbit around the sun (Fig. 1.3). Various experiments, and especially the famous Michelson–Morley experiment, failed to detect changes in the speed of light and the motion of the earth with respect to the ether.

### 1.5.2 The Michelson–Morley Experiment

The purpose of the 1881 Michelson–Morley experiment [6] was to measure the speed of the earth with respect to the ether. The result of this classic experiment is negative and contradicts the ether hypothesis.

The experimental apparatus, now known as the Michelson interferometer, is described in Fig. 1.4. It consists of two perpendicular arms of equal length  .

Fig. 1.4

The Michelson interferometer

Fig. 1.5

The velocity of the light beam in the vertical arm of the interferometer with respect to the earth

Monochromatic light from a source passes through a beam splitter (a half-silvered mirror) at the origin and is sent trough each arm, the light in the two arms starting out in phase. In each arm, the light beam bounces off a mirror at the end of the arm and is reflected back to the origin, where it is collected and sent to a telescope. There, the light beams collected by both arms interfere and, if their phases differ, an interference pattern is observed. Assume, for simplicity, that the ether is moving in the direction of the horizontal arm of Fig. 1.4 and that the light moves with speed   with respect to the ether: then the travel times in the two arms will be different.

Non-relativistic analysis: consider arm 2 (horizontal) of the interferometer, oriented in the direction of the motion of the earth through the ether. This means that the ether is moving by at speed   and that the speed of light with respect to the earth is   before reflection on the mirror   and   after reflection on  . The time of travel to the right is   and the time of travel to the left is  . The total travel time for the round trip on the horizontal arm is

(1.19)

Let us consider now arm one of the interferometer (the vertical one in Fig. 1.4) perpendicular to the ether wind: the speed of this light beam relative to the earth is   (see Fig. 1.5).5 The travel time for a round trip in the vertical arm is

(1.20)

The time difference between the two arms is

by expanding this formula using  , one obtains6

The two light beams start out in phase and return with a phase difference. The difference in the length of the paths is  , while the resulting shift of the fringes is   to second order in  , as follows from the fact that the phase is  , where   and   are the wavelength and frequency of the monochromatic light, respectively. If the entire apparatus is rotated by  , the phase difference   is doubled. Furthermore, multiple reflection (  round trips) in the mirrors could increase the length   to  . If  ,   m (as in the original Michelson interferometer),   nm, then

The Michelson interferometer was capable of detecting phase shifts   but no shift in the fringe patterns was detected.

The experiment has now been repeated many times, at different times of the year (i.e., at different points on the earth's orbit), yielding negative results.7 The simplest explanation of this experiment, which was probably known to Einstein although it is not mentioned explicitly in his 1905 paper, is that there is no ether and light does not require an ether medium to propagate.

To summarize the situation before 1905, Maxwell's theory predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves and de facto incorporated optics into electromagnetism. These waves were detected and generated experimentally by Hertz and constitute a major success of the theory. Since at that time physicists were used to the idea that waves need a medium to propagate, the existence of an ether in which electromagnetic waves can propagate was postulated. Then the earth should move through this ether and it should be possible to detect its absolute motion through the ether. The 1881 Michelson–Morley experiment designed to measure the speed of the earth relative to the ether provided a negative result, which leads to three possibilities:

1.

The ether is attached rigidly to the earth, which is clearly an ad hoc explanation and raises more problems than it solves.

2.

It was assumed that rigid bodies contract and clocks slow down when moving through the ether (an hypothesis advanced independently by Lorentz and FitzGerald in 1892 and 1889, respectively [17, 18], who could not motivate it convincingly). This ad hoc assumption does not lead to new predictions and is not falsifiable.8

3.

There is no ether. This simple explanation, adopted by Einstein, leads to the loss of absolute time and simultaneity, as we will see in the following. The disappearance of the ether concept makes the speed of light in vacuo a fundamental quantity, instead of being merely a property of the medium in which light propagates.

## 1.6 The Postulates of Special Relativity

The failure of measuring the motion of the earth with respect to the ether motivates the introduction of the two basic postulates of Special Relativity, on which the entire theory is based.

1.

Principle of Relativity: The laws of (non-gravitational) physics assume the same form in all inertial reference frames. All inertial observers are equivalent.

2.

Constancy of the speed of light: The speed of light in vacuo has the same value   in all inertial frames, regardless of the velocity of the observer or the source.

The first postulate implies that all inertial observers are equivalent and experiments cannot distinguish between different inertial observers. This assumption is not new, in fact this postulate was already contained in Newtonian mechanics. As a consequence, there is no preferred inertial system and one cannot distinguish whether a body is at rest or in uniform motion. Absolute motion does not exist—motion is relative to a frame, position and velocity are relative concepts, and only the relative motion between two inertial frames is relevant (hence the name "relativity" given to the theory). Since it is impossible to detect absolute motion, the first postulate eliminates the ether and makes a revolution of ideas possible.

The first postulate is not only a statement about mechanics and electromagnetism but comprises all kinds of physical laws (except gravitation, which is left out of Special Relativity). In retrospect, there is no purely mechanical experiment: looking at things involves light (hence optics), and matter is made of subatomic particles, nuclei, atoms, and molecules which interact through the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces,9 hence the restriction of a fundamental postulate to purely mechanical phenomena would seem artificial.

The second postulate is consistent with the first one:10 if the speed of light were not   in all inertial frames, but only in one, then a preferred frame would be selected. There is no ether and light moves with speed   with respect to any inertial observer, which explains the Michelson–Morley experiment in the simplest possible way (in Einstein's words, the concept of ether becomes "superfluous" [1]). The second postulate contains a feature that should not be overlooked, namely the isotropy of space: the speed of light has the same value in every direction in all inertial frames.

A basic feature of Special Relativity, which is ultimately unsatisfactory, is that it is based on a special class of observers, the inertial observers. It would be preferable to formulate physics in a way that is valid for all observers, inertial or not (in fact, strictly inertial reference frames extending to spatial infinity do not exist when gravity is included in the picture). This conceptual improvement is accomplished in the theory of General Relativity.

### 1.6.1 The Role of the Speed of Light

It is by now clear that the speed of light plays a major role in the theory and should rightly be regarded as a fundamental constant. The speed of light in vacuo is independent of the motion of the sources and of the observers. The mere appearance of the constant   in a formula immediately signals that electromagnetism and/or relativity are at play.

Fig. 1.6

A light signal is emitted by an observer  , bounces off a mirror  , and is reflected back to  . Units are used in which

Most relativists adopt relativistic units in which the speed of light assumes the value unity. In these units, the dimensions of a length are the same as those of time,

For clarity, we will retain the constant   in our formulas but we will set   in drawings ("spacetime diagrams") in which the horizontal axes represent one or two spatial dimensions   or   and the vertical axis represents the time  . Due to the large value of the constant   in ordinary units, these diagrams would be unreadable if standard units were used. For example, the straight line representing the equation of a light ray directed in the positive  -direction,  , would have a slope indistinguishable from zero by the eye. Choosing units in which   is particularly convenient for these diagrams.

Instead of using a rigid ruler to measure distances, in Special Relativity it is more useful to define distances operationally by using electromagnetic signals (light, radar, etc.).11 The distance between an observer and an object could be measured this way: a mirror is placed on the object and the observer sends a light signal at the time  , which is reflected off the object back to the observer and received at the time   (Fig. 1.6). The distance between the observer and the mirror is then

(1.21)

## 1.7 Consequences of the Postulates

The two postulates of Special Relativity allow one to make startling predictions concerning space, time, and simultaneity which conflict with our intuition based on everyday's experience at speeds  . These predictions originate many famous apparent paradoxes, such as the car-in-the-garage/pole-in-the-barn paradox and the twin paradox. These puzzles are not true paradoxes, they only seem paradoxical because they conflict with our intuition derived from the non-relativistic regime. Before proceeding, let us provide some definitions.

An event is defined as a point in space and time labeled by four coordinates, e.g., Cartesian coordinates  . Examples of events are 2:25 pm in the centre of the Quad at Bishop's University (although it may not look very eventful in the common sense of this word); the collision of two particles at a given instant of time; or the flash of an explosion at 12 noon at a certain point in space. The same event is assigned different coordinates in different inertial frames.

A reference frame is a coordinate grid equipped with a set of clocks located at the grid intersections and synchronized. Synchronization can be achieved by using light signals; for example, a clock sends a laser pulse to a second clock located at a distance  . It takes a time   for the signal to reach the second clock. If the second clock reads the time   when it receives the laser pulse, then the two clocks are synchronized (note that these are two clocks in the same inertial frame).

### 1.7.1 Relativity of Simultaneity

In Newtonian physics there is an absolute time  , the same for all inertial (and non-inertial) observers. Thus, if two events are simultaneous in an inertial reference frame, they are simultaneous for all inertial observers. In Special Relativity, instead, the result of the measurement of a time interval depends on the reference frame in which the measurement is made. This fact can be illustrated by a simple thought experiment (or gedankenexperiment 12): a boxcar moves with uniform velocity along a straight track. Two lightning bolts strike the ends of the boxcar simultaneously with respect to an inertial observer   who is stationary with respect to the track, leaving marks on the ground and on the boxcar (Fig. 1.7). The observer   on the ground is located midway between the marks   and   left by the lightning bolts on the ground. An inertial observer   on the boxcar is located midway between the marks   and   left on the boxcar.

Fig. 1.7

A thought experiment demonstrating the relativity of simultaneity. Two lightning bolts strike the ends of the boxcar, leaving marks on the ground and on the boxcar

According to the inertial observer  , the two light signals reach   at the same time: the events at   and   are simultaneous for  . According to the other inertial observer  , by the time light reaches  ,   has moved.13 Light from   has moved past  , while light from   has not yet reached  . But the fact that light travels at the same speed   in both frames implies that, as seen by  , lightning struck the front of the boxcar   before it struck the back  . The two events are not simultaneous for  . Hence,

events that are simultaneous in an inertial frame are not simultaneous in another inertial frame (relativity of simultaneity).

Simultaneity is not absolute: it depends on the state of motion of the observer. Both observers are correct: there is no preferred observer or preferred inertial frame. Together with the constancy of  , this fact leads to an apparent paradox in conflict with everyday's intuition. One can use a diagram with space   and time   on its axes (and units in which  ) to visualize the boxcar experiment, as shown in Fig. 1.8. Light signals from   and   reach   (represented by a vertical line in the diagram) simultaneously; the same light signals reach   (represented by an oblique line) at different times according to  .

Fig. 1.8

### 1.7.2 Time Dilation

Now consider a vehicle (for example the boxcar of the previous thought experiment) moving to the right with constant velocity  , and with a mirror attached to its ceiling. A passenger   shines a flash of laser light toward the ceiling using a laser pointer. This flash is reflected and then is received by  . Let us examine this experiment according to the inertial observer   in the moving frame   (Fig. 1.9).   carries a clock to measure the time interval   between emission and reception of the flash

(1.22)

where   is the height of the boxcar travelled twice vertically by the pulse. According to the inertial observer   in the system  , for the light to reach the mirror and return to the observer, it is necessary that light is not sent vertically, but at an angle (Fig. 1.10). It takes a time   for light to travel to the mirror and back to  . By the time the light reaches the mirror, this has moved by   and, by the time the light is back to  , the laser has moved by   after reflection. We have

or

which yields

while   is given by Eq. (1.22). Then   and   are related by

(1.23)

where

(1.24)

is the Lorentz factor, which is plotted as a function of   in Fig. 1.11. Clearly, if  , then   and  . This effect is known as time dilation: the time interval between two events depends on the state of motion of the observer. The process in the   plane is illustrated in Fig. 1.12. We define the proper time interval between two events as the time interval measured by an observer who sees the two events occurring at the same point of space. For example,   in Eq. (1.23) above is the proper time. In short,

the proper time is the time measured by a clock in the inertial frame in which it is at rest.

(Often, the proper time is denoted by the symbol   and Eq. (1.23) appears as  .) In general, a proper quantity relative to a body is one measured in its rest frame.

Fig. 1.11

The Lorentz factor   as a function of

Fig. 1.12

The time dilation experiment visualized in the   plane of the observer  . This observer measures a time interval   on the  -axis, while the moving observer   measures a different time interval   on the  -axis

The formula for time dilation (1.23) is often interpreted by saying that time "runs slower" for a moving clock than for a clock at rest, or that a moving clock "runs slower" than a clock at rest by a factor  . No reference is made to the nature of the clock: the derivation of Eq. (1.23) applies to any clock, whether it is mechanical, atomic, biological, or of unknown nature.

Example 1.6

An astronaut on a spacecraft moving at speed   with respect to his twin on earth will measure a different time interval between his departure and his return than the time interval measured by his twin. For the astronaut, time "runs slower" by a factor   with respect to the time measured by his twin on earth, but the astronaut would not have any perception of this fact.

* * *

It is clear from Eq. (1.23) that time dilation is a second order effect in  . In fact, by expanding the Lorentz factor in powers of  , one obtains

(1.25)

for  .

Example 1.7

Another example of time dilation is given by the measured lifetime of muons in cosmic rays. A muon ( ) is an unstable particle which decays into electrons (e ) or positrons (e ), neutrinos ( ), and antineutrinos ( ) according to

(here   denote the electron and muon neutrinos, respectively) in   (proper lifetime) in a reference frame in which it is at rest. Muons are produced as secondary cosmic rays by primary cosmic rays colliding with nuclei in the upper troposphere and travel at speeds  . It is observed that they reach the surface of the earth before they decay, hence, in the frame in which they move at  , their lifetime is much > . In   they would only cover   m, while the upper troposphere reaches an elevation of approximately 10 km. It is time dilation that makes the muon lifetime longer for an observer in an inertial frame attached to the earth in which the muon moves with speed  , according to

If  , then  ,   in the earth's frame, and the distance travelled by the muon is   m. A classic experiment was performed in 1941 by Rossi and Hall by measuring muon fluxes at the top and at the bottom of Mt. Washington in New England, which are separated by an elevation difference of 2,000 m (the muon speed is  ) with results agreeing with the time dilation formula (1.23) [22]. The experiment was repeated with higher accuracy at CERN in 1971 for muons with speed   [23] and it is now feasible as a training experience for undergraduates [24]. Time dilation is tested every day in particle physics experiments; synchrotrons and modern accelerators would not work if they were based on Newtonian mechanics instead of Special Relativity.

Another classic experiment testing time dilation was performed by Hafele and Keating in 1972 [25]. Atomic clocks were flown on airplanes and, at their return to the air base, were compared with stationary clocks. The result agrees with Special Relativity (plus a correction due to General Relativity because of the different values of the gravitational field of the earth on the ground and on the airplane).

It is common in the literature to denote the ratio of a speed to the speed of light as

(1.26)

and the Lorentz factor with  .

It is easy to see that the Lorentz factor  satisfies the relations

### 1.7.3 The Twin "Paradox"

A famous apparent paradox of Special Relativity is the so-called twin paradox.14 Consider two identical 20 years old twins, John and Slown. John takes off in a spaceship travelling at   relative to Slown, reaches a planet 10 light years away, and then returns. Due to time dilation, John finds that Slown is much older than himself. How is this possible?

According to Slown, the spaceship has travelled   light years at speed  , taking   years; Slown is now 60 years old (this is the proper age of Slown). For John, the travel time is

John is now 54.6 years old (proper age of John). Were we to allow John to travel at speed  , instead, John would be 28.7 years old and Slown would be 42.2 years old.

A common objection is the following: why are the two reference frames not symmetric? Can't we invert the argument by saying that John moves at speed   with respect to Slown? The answer is negative: to invert the trip and return home, John must undergo acceleration, while Slown does not. Even though acceleration lasts only for a short period of time, it cannot be neglected. The two frames are not symmetrical, and there is no paradox.15 Asymmetry between the two frames is the key to understanding the twin "paradox". In an   diagram, comparing the ages of the twins amounts to comparing the proper times elapsed for two different observers, i.e., to comparing Lorentzian lengths along their representative curves in this diagram. These two curves are not symmetric.16

### 1.7.4 Length Contraction

As we have seen, time intervals are not absolute in Special Relativity. Likewise, lengths depend on the motion of the observer. We define the proper length   of an object as the length of that object measured in a frame in which it is at rest.

The length of an object measured in a frame in which it is moving is always less than its proper length, according to

(1.31)

a phenomenon called Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction. In the limit  , length contraction is a second order effect in  . This formula was derived by Lorentz in 1892 and was interpreted by Lorentz and Poincaré as a mysterious contraction of matter related to the ether. It was only with Einstein's 1905 theory that the correct interpretation of Eq. (1.31) emerged as a consequence of the two simple postulates of Special Relativity.

Fig. 1.13

The Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction of the distance between two stars seen by the inertial observer   in a spaceship

To derive the formula (1.31), consider a (point-like) spaceship travelling at uniform speed   and two inertial observers,   on earth and   on the spaceship, respectively. The observer on earth measures the distance travelled by the spaceship (e.g., the distance between two stars, fixed in the reference frame of  ) as   (Fig. 1.13). According to the observer   on earth, the time taken for the spaceship to go from the first to the second star is

Because of time dilation,  measures the time   given by   or  , and concludes that the second star travels toward him with speed   and, in the time  , it covers the distance

Therefore, we obtain the formula for the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction

If an object has proper length  , its length will be   when measured by an observer in uniform motion with velocity  . Note that the two inertial frames are not symmetric, in the sense that the object is at rest in one frame (rest frame), but not in the other.

Example 1.8

Let us discuss again muons generated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere and travelling to the surface of the earth. A muon in motion sees the length   of the atmosphere Lorentz-contracted to   and can cover it in only  . In the frame of the earth there is time dilation but no length contraction; in the rest frame of the muon there is no time dilation but there is length contraction.

Example 1.9

What is the length of a rod which is 2 m long in its rest frame, when seen passing by at  ?

Its length will be   m, a significant reduction compared to the proper length.

* * *

Consider now an extended object in motion with constant speed   with respect to an inertial observer. Let   be the proper volume of that object, i.e., the volume in its rest frame. Since, in a change of inertial frame, the transversal directions are not altered, the relation between the volume in an inertial frame moving with speed   with respect to the rest frame and the proper volume is

(1.32)

#### 1.7.4.1 The Car-in-the-Garage "Paradox"

Another of the apparent paradoxes of Special Relativity, known as the car-in-the-garage paradox (also known as the pole-in-the-barn paradox), arises from the phenomenon of length contraction. A man has an   m long garage and buys an   m long car (proper length of the car). He reasons that, if he drives sufficiently fast, the car will fit in the garage due to length contraction (ignore the fact that he is going to ruin his new car by smashing it against the garage wall). Using the formula for length contraction (1.31), he easily finds that he must drive at speed   (corresponding to a Lorentz factor  ). But how can a 7 m long car fit into a 5 m long garage? This apparent paradox defies everyday's intuition, yet the conclusion is sound according to Special Relativity (which is certainly more appropriate than everyday's intuition for high speeds). The proper length of the car is still 7 m, but it will fit into the 5 m garage when the man's brother closes the door behind him.

A natural objection is: why the car, which is at rest in its own rest frame, does not see the garage approaching with velocity   and Lorentz-contracted to   m (in which case the car won't fit in the garage)? The answer lies in the fact that the two events "front of the car at the garage wall" and "back of the car at the garage door" are not simultaneous in the rest frame of the car, while they are simultaneous in the rest frame of the garage. In the rest frame of the car, the front of the car is against the garage wall which is moving toward it. Because it takes a finite time for the shock wave to cross the length of the car and reach its back, the latter is still at rest while the approaching garage takes with it, in its motion, the front of the car for a while. During this time interval, the information that the front of the car is in contact with the garage wall has not yet reached the back of the car. Because of this time delay, the back of the car gets in the garage after its front. By contrast, in the frame attached to the garage, both ends of the car are in the garage simultaneously when the door is closed. The phenomenon is real as seen in any inertial frame: its explanation, however, is quite different in different inertial frames (in this case, the explanation is more complicated in the rest frame of the car than in the garage frame).

## 1.8 Conclusion

Important ingredients of Special Relativity were discovered at the end of the nineteenth century by studying the then new theory of electromagnetism. However, Einstein decided to rethink the fundamental concepts of time and space, which led him to formulating the two postulates instead of focusing on the mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation and inventing ad hoc explanations. We have appreciated that the two postulates, which express simple ideas, have profound consequences such as the relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction. We are now ready to express these concepts in a mathematical form by using the law relating two inertial frames, the Lorentz transformation.

These important physical phenomena can be seen as direct consequences of the correct transformation relating inertial frames, the Lorentz transformation. This transformation is the key for the formulation of Special Relativity in an enlightening four-dimensional formalism, which we will see in the next chapter. Here we study the Lorentz transformation and its properties and derive length contraction and time dilation directly from it, in addition to the transformation property of velocities. We must emphasize that, although the Lorentz transformation was discovered by studying the Maxwell equations, its validity is more general. The Lorentz transformation relates inertial frames without reference to the kind of physics studied in them. Lorentz-invariance is a general requirement for any physical theory, not just for electromagnetism.

## 2.1 Introduction

Now that we have seen the main consequences of the postulates of Special Relativity, i.e., the relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction it is clear that the Galilei transformation, with its absolute time, is incorrect. These important physical phenomena can be seen as direct consequences of the correct transformation relating inertial frames, the Lorentz transformation. This transformation is the key for the formulation of Special Relativity in an enlightening four-dimensional formalism, which we will see in the next chapter. Here we study the Lorentz transformation and its properties and derive length contraction and time dilation directly from it, in addition to the transformation property of velocities. We must emphasize that, although the Lorentz transformation was discovered by studying the Maxwell equations, its validity is more general. The Lorentz transformation relates inertial frames without reference to the kind of physics studied in them. Lorentz-invariance is a general requirement for any physical theory, not just for electromagnetism.

## 2.2 The Lorentz Transformation

The Galilei transformation is not valid for speeds which are not negligible in comparison with the speed of light. The correct transformation relating space and time coordinates in two inertial frames   and   moving with relative velocity   in standard configuration was discovered by Fitzgerald in 1889 and by Lorentz in 1892 as the transformation which leaves the Maxwell equations invariant.1 The Lorentz transformation or Lorentz boost is2

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

The most striking feature of this linear coordinate transformation (bear in mind that   and   are constants) is that it mixes the space and time coordinates. As a consequence, time intervals and 3-dimensional lengths are not invariant under this transformation and, therefore, time intervals and 3-dimensional lengths are not absolute quantities. The equations of electromagnetism are invariant under this transformation (it is said that they are Lorentz-invariant) but the equations of Newtonian mechanics are not.

The inverse Lorentz transformation is obtained by the exchange   and   according to the Principle of Relativity3:

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

Although the Lorentz transformation was obtained before the formulation of Special Relativity as the correct transformation between inertial frames which respects the Maxwell equations, its meaning was not grasped until Einstein's 1905 paper.

## 2.3 Derivation of the Lorentz Transformation

The Lorentz transformation can be derived on the basis of the two postulates of Special Relativity. First, due to the isotropy of space contained in the second postulate, we can orient the spatial axes of an inertial frame   with those of another inertial frame   and limit ourselves to considering motion of the two frames in standard configuration. As a starting point for deducing the transformation relating two inertial frames   and   in relative motion with velocity   in standard configuration, it is reasonable to assume that the transformation is linear

(2.9)

where   is a dimensionless constant that depends only on  . This assumption corresponds to the homogeneity of space and time since   does not depend on  . Since the spatial part of the Galilei transformation  must be recovered in the limit  ,   must tend to unity in this limit.

The laws of physics must have the same form in   and  , and then one must obtain the inverse Lorentz transformation by the exchange   and   (this is the Principle of Relativity again):

(2.10)

There is no relative motion in the   and   directions, hence these coordinates must not be affected by the transformation,

(2.11)

Consider now a spherical pulse of electromagnetic radiation emitted at the origin of   at  . It is received at a point on the  -axis and, during its propagation,

(2.12)

The same law must be true in   due to the constancy of the speed of light,

(2.13)

or   from Eq. (2.9), which leads to

(2.14)

while

(2.15)

By substituting Eq. (2.14) into Eq. (2.10), one obtains

and

Therefore, we have

the Lorentz factor, and

(2.16)

Use then   and   and substitute   into   to obtain

from which we obtain

and

Since

we have

and, finally,

(2.17)

which completes the derivation. Equations (2.16), (2.11), and (2.17) constitute the Lorentz transformation. The fact that the Lorentz transformation can be derived from the two postulates of Special Relativity is conceptually important: it means that these two postulates constitute the physical explanation of the mathematical transformation and that this transformation should not be assumed in place of the two postulates, as Poincaré seem to have intended. While Poincaré, Lorentz, and FitzGerald stopped at the transformation (which is an important ingredient of Special Relativity and unveils the mixing of space and time of the 4-dimensional world view), they tried to explain it with an ether and with length contraction. It was Einstein's genius which reduced the physical explanation of the transformation to two simple and general postulates and led to a re-examination of the concepts of space and time, developing the full theory which was missed by other researchers.

## 2.4 Mathematical Properties of the Lorentz Transformation

Let us examine the properties of the Lorentz transformation.

  * Qualitatively, the Lorentz transformation mixes   and  , therefore 3-dimensional lengths and time intervals cannot be left invariant. Quantitatively, length contraction and time dilation can be derived from the Lorentz transformation as a consequence, which will be done in the following sections.

The quantity

("Minkowski line element") is invariant under Lorentz transformations.

This invariance is easy to see: by using the Lorentz transformation we have

We will discuss extensively this aspect of Special Relativity in the following chapters.

  * The Lorentz transformation is symmetric under the exchange  :

becomes

In standard configuration, the Lorentz transformation is also symmetric under the exchange  .

  * The Galilei transformation can somehow be recovered from the Lorentz transformation in the limit of small velocities  , although the derivation is a bit finicky. First, expand the Lorentz factor  to first order in  :

(2.18)

and

Strictly speaking, the transformation of the time coordinate gives, to first order in  ,

not   as in the Galilei transformation: the relativity of simultaneity persists to first order (it is a first order effect in  ). If the Lorentz transformation reduced to the Galilei transformation to first order, then infinitesimal Lorentz transformations and infinitesimal Galilei transformations would coincide, which is not the case.4 However, time dilation is computed by considering time differences, recording two spatial events at the same location. Since  , by setting  , time dilation is eliminated to first order. In practice, when speeds are small, time intervals   are measured over spatial distances   such that   and the   term can be dropped. Although the Lorentz transformation does not quite reduce to the Galilei transformation, which is recovered only in the limit  , Newtonian mechanics and the Galilei transformation turn out to be adequate5 in the limit  .

  * Since the Lorentz transformation is linear and homogeneous, finite coordinate differences transform in the same way as infinitesimal coordinate differences:

## 2.5 Absolute Speed Limit and Causality

At this point, you are certainly aware that  , the ratio between coordinate and proper times, diverges as  . The inequality   leads to a purely imaginary  , therefore,

the relative velocity of two inertial frames must be strictly smaller than  .

Since an inertial frame can be associated with any non-accelerated particle or object moving with subluminal (i.e.,  ) speed, this statement translates into the requirement that the speed of particles and of all physical signals be limited by   (remember that   is the sped of light in vacuo: the speed of particles traveling in a medium can be larger than the speed of light in that medium).6 Never mind the fact that the Lorentz factor becomes imaginary: we can agree to define   as the modulus   if  . What is truly important7 is that

the restriction   preserves the notion of cause and effect.

In fact, consider a process in which an event   causes, or affects, an event   by sending a signal containing some information from   to  . If a signal were sent from   to   at superluminal speed   in some inertial frame  , we could orient the axes of   so that both events   and   occur on the  -axis and their time and spatial separations satisfy   and   in this frame. Then, in an inertial frame   moving with respect to   with speed   in standard configuration, we would have

(2.19)

where we used  . Now, because   it is also   which, together with  , implies that   or  , so

(2.20)

According to this result, in the frame   the event   precedes  : cause and effect are reversed or, the signal goes backward in time. The signal reaches   before being emitted by  , which creates a logical problem. The fact that there is an absolute speed limit   comes to the rescue and enforces causality: if both  , then   in Eq. (2.19) has the same sign as  . The possibility of reversing cause and effect and travelling in time would lead to logical paradoxes, which have been discussed at length in the literature (see, e.g., [9] and the references therein).

Another argument against superluminal travel is the following.8 Suppose that an observer  , at rest in an inertial frame, emits a flash of laser light in a certain direction (called the "forward" direction). A second observer   at rest in the same inertial frame sees the light, measuring that it moves with speed  . A third inertial observer   is moving with respect to   and   in the "backward" direction with constant speed  . According to the second postulate, he measures light moving with speed   in the "forward" direction. He also sees   and   moving in the "forward" direction toward him with speed  . Now, it is impossible for this speed   of the observers   and   measured by   to be larger than  . For, were this possible, the flash of laser light, when emitted by  , will remain behind  . According to  , the laser light would always remain behind   and the observer   (who is "forward" of  ) would never see this light. But then whether   sees the light or not depends on the inertial frame, which contradicts the Principle of Relativity stating that all inertial frames are physically equivalent. Therefore, the relative speed of two inertial frames cannot be larger than  . Formally, the argument works also if the relative speed of inertial frames equals   for, in that case, light will never reach   according to the observer  .

If there is an absolute speed limit   then, according to the Principle of Relativity, this limit must be the same in all inertial frames, consistent with the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light.9

The absolute speed limit refers to physical, propagating signals. Apparent motions which carry no information can have arbitrarily large speeds. In these cases, certain motions appear to be faster than light, but they are illusions and not real motions. For example, consider a searchlight spot on high clouds (Fig. 2.1).

Fig. 2.1

If   becomes sufficiently large, a searchlight spot on a high cloud can attain an arbitrarily large apparent linear velocity

Let   be the angle spanned by the light spot across a cloud in the time  . The linear velocity of the spot perceived by an observer on the ground is  , where   is the distance to the cloud. If  , the apparent linear velocity of the spot   is larger than   if  . This distance is too large for a searchlight in the atmosphere but it illustrates the principle and it is not too large for astrophysical phenomena (apparent superluminal motions do occur in astrophysics and they constituted a puzzle when they were first discovered [11, 12]). In any case, everyday experience shows the apparent amplification of velocity when a searchlight spot moves on clouds.10 The point is, the perceived velocity of the spot is not related to the velocity of propagation of the light beam.

Unphysical velocities occur also when waves propagate in a dispersive medium. In general, a wave signal11 is composed of many, or infinite, monochromatic waves of angular frequencies   and wave vectors  , with  . The properties of the medium are described by a dispersion relation  , a functional relation between   and  . The individual monochromatic waves composing the complex wave propagate at the phase velocity 12

(2.21)

while the "envelope" composed of the individual monochromatic waves travels at the group velocity

(2.22)

In Eqs. (2.21) and (2.22) the right hand sides must be evaluated at a central value13 of  .

If the dispersion relation  is linear, the medium is non-dispersive; if this relation is non-linear, it is dispersive. Then the individual component waves have phase velocities which depend on their wave vectors (or wavelengths  ) and the waveform is altered as it propagates through the medium. Phase velocity and group velocity then differ, and the physical velocity of the wave (the velocity at which energy and information propagate) is the group velocity. It is possible that, formally, phase velocities be larger than  . This fact does not violate Special Relativity because   is not the true velocity of propagation of the signal. When wavepackets are not too spread out and group velocities are well defined and physically meaningful,14 they have values which are no larger than  .

A consequence of the existence of an absolute speed limit is that the idealizations of rigid body and incompressible fluid used in Newtonian mechanics, which imply infinite sound speed, are impossible in Special Relativity. By definition, such systems would transmit information instantaneously by means of sound waves propagating with infinite speed.

Example 2.1

The fastest spinning pulsar known to date, PSR J1746-2446ad, spins with a frequency of 716 Hz [17]. What limit is imposed by fundamental physics on its radius  ?

The answer is that the equatorial speed, which is the largest rotational speed of a particle on the pulsar, must be less than  , yielding

Neutron stars are believed to have sizes   km, which brings them fairly close to achieving the largest rotational speeds that are possible in nature.

## 2.6 Length Contraction from the Lorentz Transformation

Length contraction and time delay can be derived directly from the Lorentz transformation. Consider a rod at rest in the inertial frame   and moving with speed   with respect to another inertial frame   as in Fig. 2.2. The endpoints of the rod are   and   with   the rest length of the rod. According to the Lorentz transformation, it is

(2.23)

In order to measure the rod, we must find the coordinates of the endpoints at the same time   (the two endpoints are observed simultaneously). We have

or

and

(2.24)

the Lorentz-FitzGerald formula for length contraction.

Fig. 2.2

The inertial frames   and

There is no contraction in the directions transversal to the motion. As a result of length contraction, a moving rod can be fit momentarily in a space in which it would not fit at rest (which originates the car-in-the-garage "paradox"). However, nothing has happened to the rod. If you measure it again in its rest frame, it still has the same rest length  .

## 2.7 Time Dilation from the Lorentz Transformation

Let us now derive time dilation directly from the Lorentz transformation. Let a clock at rest at   in the inertial frame   record two events happening at the same location   and separated by the proper time interval  . The two events have coordinates   and  . What is the time interval measured by a clock in the inertial frame   which is moving with constant speed   with respect to  ? The inverse Lorentz transformation (2.5)–(2.8) gives, for these two events,

(2.25)

and the time interval in   is

or

(2.26)

A moving clock "runs slower" than a static one by the Lorentz factor .

An ideal clock is defined as one that is not affected by acceleration. The finite interval of proper time recorded by an (ideal) clock between proper instants   and   is

(2.27)

Example 2.2

Because they are light, electrons can be easily accelerated to become very relativistic. Consider an electron traveling at speed   in an accelerator. The time interval   s in the laboratory frame corresponds, in the rest frame of this electron, to the interval  .

## 2.8 Transformation of Velocities and Accelerations in Special Relativity

Contrary to Newtonian mechanics, velocities do not simply "add up" in Special Relativity, otherwise an observer moving toward a light source would measure the speed of light to be larger than  , which contradicts the second postulate. In order to derive the correct formula for the composition of relativistic velocities,15 suppose that a particle has velocity   relative to an inertial frame  ; we want to find its velocity   with respect to another inertial frame  , with respect to which   is moving with constant velocity   (Fig. 2.3). Remember the convention that the velocity   is positive if the inertial frame   is moving away from  . Differentiate the Lorentz transformation (2.1)–(2.4) to obtain

and

Analogously,  , and

The relativistic velocity addition formulae are, therefore,

Fig. 2.3

The composition of velocities   and   in Special Relativity

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

Note that we did not assume that the particle has uniform velocity   in  ; the derivation is valid for instantaneous velocities. In addition, while   is restricted to be less than  ,  , and   can be the coordinate velocity components of a light ray.16

Let us consider two limiting cases. In the Newtonian limit   we have, to first order,

In the ultrarelativistic limit   we have  , in agreement with the postulate that the speed of light is   in every inertial frame. This conclusion is not surprising since it is built into the Lorentz transformation used here to derive the addition law of velocities.

If the two inertial frames are in standard configuration, planar motions remain planar under the change of frame. In fact if, for example, the motion of a particle occurs in the   plane according to  , then   and, according to Eq. (2.30), also  . A rectilinear motion along the  -axis of   (with  ) appears as a rectilinear motion along the  -axis of   (with  ). The rectilinear motion of a particle along the  -axis of   is, of course, distorted according to   (since  , and  ), as is rectilinear motion along the  -axis (since  , and  ).

According to the Principle of Relativity, the inverse velocity transformation is obtained with the exchange   yielding

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

### 2.8.1 Relative Velocity of Two Particles

Consider two particles moving instantaneously along the same line with speeds   and   in an inertial frame  . Their relative velocity is computed by using an inertial frame   in which particle 1 is at rest. In this frame, which has a velocity (and speed)   with respect to  , particle 2 has the velocity

(2.34)

where   is the velocity of particle 2 in the frame  . This is the relativistic law of composition of velocities. Then, it is

(2.35)

The relative speed of the two particles is given by

(2.36)

Example 2.3

In a science fiction movie two spaceships are moving head-on toward each other with speeds   and   with respect to an observer on earth. What is the relative speed measured by the astronauts on each ship?

The relative speed is

which is obviously larger than the speed of each spaceship with respect to earth but still less than  .

* * *

Let us study now the function of two variables

(2.37)

appearing in the law of composition of relativistic speeds, in the relevant range  . Here   and  . Physics tells us that the value of this function should never exceed unity, which is confirmed by the following mathematical considerations. Note that  ,   is continuous with all its derivatives of any order in  ,  ,

and   at  . The differential of   is

The maximum of the function   is attained at   and

hence  . The function   is plotted in Fig. 2.4.

Fig. 2.4

The function   of   and

### 2.8.2 Relativistic Transformation Law of Accelerations

In a way similar to how the relativistic transformation law of velocities is derived, one can obtain the relativistic law of transformation of accelerations under a change of inertial frames (found by Tolman in 1912 [21])

(2.38)

(2.39)

(2.40)

where   (the detailed derivation is left as an exercise). From these transformation properties it follows that all inertial observers agree on whether a particle is accelerated or not. Moreover, if a particle has 3-dimensional acceleration  constant in one inertial frame, its acceleration is necessarily non-constant in another inertial frame. Finally, we note that in the Newtonian limit   the acceleration is Galilei-invariant,  , and Newton's second law is invariant under Galilei transformations, as already discussed.

## 2.9 Matrix Representation of the Lorentz Transformation

The Lorentz transformation

is a linear homogeneous coordinate transformation in the space   and can be represented by a symmetric   matrix   with components given by

(2.41)

where   and  . This is a real symmetric   matrix parametrized by the parameter  . To check that this representation is correct, take the product

therefore,

which is the Lorentz transformation.

The matrix   of the Lorentz transformation has unit determinant:

The inverse of the matrix   is the matrix   corresponding to the inverse Lorentz transformation,

(2.42)

In fact, we have

and

The matrix corresponding to   and   is obviously the identity matrix.

## 2.10   The Lorentz Group

As Poincaré realized, the Lorentz transformations   form a group with respect to the composition of transformations  . In fact,

  * if   are Lorentz transformations, then   is a Lorentz transformation   with parameter

(2.43)

given by the relativistic law of composition of velocities. Of course, one can obtain this result directly using the matrix representation of   and  , which has the advantage of providing an alternative derivation of the law of composition of velocities. Let   and   be Lorentz transformations represented by

and

respectively. Then

and letting  , we have

Then

and finally

(2.44)

which is the law of composition of velocities. Two consecutive Lorentz transformations with parallel velocity vectors   and   commute, i.e., the result of the combined transformations does not depend on the order in which they are performed. This is no longer true if   and   are not parallel, contrary to the case of Galilei transformations. To conclude, the composition of two Lorentz transformations is a Lorentz transformation.

  * The operation   is associative.

  * The transformation   corresponding to   is the neutral element of the group.

  * For any Lorentz transformation   there is an inverse Lorentz transformation

(2.45)

The fact that   is invertible follows from the fact that its determinant is unity.

To conclude, the Lorentz transformations   form a group. Since they depend on a continuous parameter  , this is called a continuous 1-parameter group.

Pure Lorentz transformations in standard configuration form a group but other linear coordinate transformations which leave the interval   invariant can be added, including continuous transformations such as purely spatial rotations (which themselves form a 3-parameter group called special orthogonal group SO(3)), spatial translations  , and time translations  ; and discrete transformations such as reflections of the spatial axes and time reflection. A proper transformation is one with determinant equal to unity and an orthochronous transformation is one which preserves the time orientation, i.e.,  . The proper orthochronous Lorentz group is a 6-parameter continuous group consisting of one Lorentz boost in standard configuration (parametrized by one continuous parameter  ), two spatial rotations needed to align the  -axis of the inertial frame   with the velocity   of the inertial observer   (which needs two angles as continuous parameters), and three spatial rotations to rotate the frame   of the inertial observer   in the same orientation of the frame   of the inertial observer  , accounting for the remaining three continuous parameters, which are rotation angles about the three spatial axes).

By adding the translations in space and time  , where the   are constants, one obtains the ten-parameter Poincaré group consisting of linear inhomogeneous transformations   which leave the interval   invariant.

## 2.11 The Lorentz Transformation as a Rotation by an Imaginary Angle with Imaginary Time

An interesting mathematical representation of the Lorentz transformation is the following. Considering again two inertial frames in relative motion with speed   in standard configuration, it is straightforward to check that the quantity   is invariant under Lorentz transformations. Define the imaginary "times"   and   in the two inertial frames. Then   is a Lorentz invariant, i.e.,

The distance from the origin is invariant under a rotation in the   plane described by

(2.46)

or, in matrix form,

(2.47)

We see that the  -axis has equation   equivalent to   and that a rotation producing this axis satisfies

Therefore,

(2.48)

corresponds to an imaginary rotation angle  . Since

we have   and

while

so that

Then  ,  , and  . It is customary to define the rapidity   by17

(2.49)

then the relation   gives   and, using the identity  , one obtains  , or

and

(2.50)

We can revisit the fact that Lorentz transformations form a group by viewing Lorentz boosts as rotations by imaginary angles in a space with imaginary time.

The composition of   and   is a Lorentz boost   with speed  . To prove this statement, note that

(2.52)

in other words, the rapidity  is additive, like all angles (Fig 2.5).

The trivial transformation   is a rotation by an angle  . Moreover,   because   corresponds to   and   corresponds to  .

## 2.12   The GPS System

The Global Positioning System (GPS) nowadays used for navigating aircrafts, shipping, in private and commercial vehicles, and for urban navigation and wilderness recreation, originated in the 1970s for military navigation purposes following a few predecessors and early ideas dating back to the 1940s [22, 23]. More exotic applications include the monitoring of shifts in plate tectonics and more mundane applications include the precise time-stamping of financial transactions. GPS receivers available in outdoor stores have a typical position accuracy of 15 m, while differential techniques using multiple receivers next to each other can potentially achieve an accuracy of centimeters ("survey grade GPS").

The GPS system consists of a constellation of twenty-four satellites (plus spares) in six orbital planes, in each of which reside four satellites, in high (  km radius) orbits all with a period of twelve hours. Each satellite carries a stable atomic clock which keeps track of time with fractional stability better than one part in  . This network of satellites is designed so that, from any point on the earth with unobstructed line of sight, at least four satellites are visible above the horizon at any time. GPS receivers on the ground, in flight, or on a ship detect signals emitted by these satellites and determine their own position by means of triangulation.

When a signal is emitted from a satellite, it carries encoded with it information about the precise time and position at which it was emitted. The distance between the satellite and a GPS receiver detecting it is the time difference between emission and detection of this signal multiplied by  . The receiver communicates with several satellites and it is a straightforward triangulation problem to compute the receiver's location using four or more satellites. However, for this task to be performed, the time must be kept to high accuracy, and this is where relativistic effects come into play. In order to achieve an accuracy of 15 m, times must be known with an error not less than   s (50 ns). Since the satellites are moving with respect to an observer on the ground, a ship, or an aircraft, the relativistic time dilation effect is present. The linear speed of a satellite in a circular orbit of radius   and angular velocity   with respect to the ground is

The proper time   of the satellite and the time   of the observer on the ground are related by  ; the ratio   is the percent frequency shift of a signal   and  . Over 24 h, the time error is  . A more precise calculation takes into account the fact that the earth rotates and the position is referred to a rotating reference frame and not an inertial frame. Moreover, the satellites' orbits are not exactly circular but elliptical and are perturbed by the moon and the sun, while the earth is not perfectly spherical and has local overdensities and underdensities affecting these orbits. When all these effects are taken into account, the error arising from neglecting Special Relativity would amount to 7 ms per day. Even more important is a general-relativistic effect which consists in the slowing down of clocks in a gravitational potential well with respect to clocks far away. If   is the Newtonian gravitational potential and   is the difference in the values of this quantity at the emission and detection points, the frequency shift of a signal is  . This second effect, if not accounted for, would be responsible for an error of 45  s per day. The two effects subtract from each other, since a moving click ticks slower than a stationary one while a clock far away from a mass ticks faster than one closer to it. As a result, there would be a net error of 38  s per day in neglecting these effects. Since errors larger than   s ruin the required 15 m precision, at the rate of   s day it would take 114 s   minutes to build up the necessary error for the GPS to fail. In a full day, the accumulated time error of   s would correspond to a position error of   km, certainly not what you want when landing a commercial aircraft in poor visibility, piloting a large ship in narrow straits, or trying to find a precise spot on an arctic expedition or crossing a desert. The GPS system automatically corrects for the general- and special- relativistic effects. Without these corrections the GPS system would become completely useless in a matter of minutes or hours. This example shows how the seemingly abstract theory of Special Relativity and the seemingly even more abstract theory of General Relativity (whose effects are actually about six times more pronounced than Special Relativity in the GPS system), have become essential to the functioning of modern life.

## 2.13 Conclusion

The theoretical discovery of the Lorentz transformation was an important step of the learning process leading to Special Relativity, but its deep meaning was not understood before Einstein. In our presentation we have made it clear that the Lorentz transformation can be derived from the two postulates of Special Relativity, which are physically more transparent than what, at first sight, appears "only" as a mathematical transformation. From the physical point of view it is more satisfactory to construct the theory beginning from two very clear ideas rather than from a telling, but less transparent, mathematical symmetry. However, the Lorentz group constitutes the symmetry group of Special Relativity and suggests a unified view of space and time, a new way of looking at nature which we present in the next chapter.

His interpretation, however, is rather misleading: the Lorentz transformation relates measurements performed in two different inertial systems.

A priori, the constant   appearing in the Lorentz transformation is a fundamental velocity which needs not coincide with the speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuo, and is only later identified with it.

Abstract

We have seen the basic physical consequences of the two postulates of Special Relativity and we know how to derive them from the mathematical transformation relating two inertial frames, the Lorentz transformation. The mathematics gives us an insight into how space and time are inextricably mixed and the most natural way to see this is in a representation of the world with four dimensions, three spatial and one temporal. This is not just mathematics: the physics just makes so much more sense when viewed in four dimensions than in three spatial dimensions with time as a parameter (because that's all time is in Newtonian physics). In this chapter we begin to study the geometry of the 4-dimensional continuum. The description of physics in this continuum requires the formalism of tensors, which is presented in the next chapter. After learning this formalism, we will study the kinematics and dynamics of point particles and systems of particles. However, it is not until Chap. 9 (when continuous distributions of matter and fields are introduced into the spacetime arena), that the power and elegance of the 4-dimensional world view are fully revealed.

Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.

## 3.1 Introduction

We have seen the basic physical consequences of the two postulates of Special Relativity and we know how to derive them from the mathematical transformation relating two inertial frames, the Lorentz transformation. The mathematics gives us an insight into how space and time are inextricably mixed and the most natural way to see this is in a representation of the world with four dimensions, three spatial and one temporal. This is not just mathematics: the physics just makes so much more sense when viewed in four dimensions than in three spatial dimensions with time as a parameter (because that's all time is in Newtonian physics). In this chapter we begin to study the geometry of the 4-dimensional continuum. The description of physics in this continuum requires the formalism of tensors, which is presented in the next chapter. After learning this formalism, we will study the kinematics and dynamics of point particles and systems of particles. However, it is not until Chap.  (when continuous distributions of matter and fields are introduced into the spacetime arena), that the power and elegance of the 4-dimensional world view are fully revealed.

## 3.2 The 4-Dimensional World

Let us compare the Galilei and the Lorentz transformations:

Since the Lorentz transformation mixes the time and space coordinates, it implicitly suggests to treat these quantities on the same footing and to contemplate a 4-dimensional space  . The 4-dimensional world view was developed by Hermann Minkowski after the publication of Einstein's theory. In Minkowski's words,1 "Henceforth space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality".

In the Newtonian picture of the world, space and time are separate entities with time playing the role of a parameter in the Newtonian equations of motion. An event is now simply a point in the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. If we consider two simultaneous events   and  , the 3-dimensional Euclidean distance (squared)

(3.1)

between the two spatial points is invariant under Galilei transformations. In the 4-dimensional view of the universe of Special Relativity, time and space merge into a continuum called spacetime. Given any two events   and  , the quantity that is invariant under Lorentz transformations is not the 3-dimensional length   nor the time separation   between these events, but rather the 4-dimensional spacetime interval (squared)

(3.2)

which is not positive-definite (in spite of the use of the symbol  ). For infinitesimally close events   and  , the infinitesimal interval or line element in Cartesian coordinates is

(3.3)

3-dimensional lengths and time intervals are relative to the inertial observer, while the 4-dimensional   is absolute in Special Relativity; it is the same for all inertial observers related by a Lorentz transformation,

(3.4)

or

(3.5)

as we already checked in Sect. 2.​4. A 4-dimensional spacetime continuum equipped with the line element (3.3) which is invariant is called Minkowski spacetime. The background geometry for Special Relativity is the space   but not with the usual Euclidean notion of distance between points. The notion of distance needs to be generalized by the line element   given by Eq. (3.3) because Lorentz transformations leave invariant   but not the quantities  ,  , or  . It is   which is fundamental—in fact, the geometry of Minkowski space is even more fundamental than the theory of electromagnetism which led us to Special Relativity. Electromagnetic waves in vacuo, or zero-mass particles, and any signal which propagates at light speed satisfy the equation   or

(3.6)

Example 3.1

We are now ready to revisit our example of Chap.  in which a flash of light is emitted at the origin of an inertial system at   and, at time  , is found on the surface of a sphere of radius  . We have seen that the Galilei transformation to another inertial frame does not preserve this sphere, nor the equation  . However, Lorentz transformations leave this equation invariant because it corresponds to  . Since the Maxwell equations are left invariant by Lorentz transformations, so is the propagation of light in this example.

* * *

We have already seen that the speed of light is a boundary that can never be crossed, or reached, by adding velocities smaller than  . Geometrically, this means that signals emitted at a spacetime point do not go out of the light cone emanating from that point, which is a surface generated by light rays passing through that point. In a two-dimensional   diagram using units such that  , the light cone through a point is the locus of spacetime points forming two straight lines inclined at   and passing through that point (Fig. 3.1).

Fig. 3.1

The future light cone of the spacetime point   and a tachyonic trajectory. The region   marked as "forbidden" cannot be reached from O using particles traveling at speeds

Massive particles are subluminal, i.e., they travel at speeds  ; luminal particles travel at the speed of light   and comprise photons, gravitons, and possibly unknown particles with zero rest mass. Superluminal particles, also called tachyons, travelling at speeds   have never been observed. Either they don't exist, or they don't interact with ordinary matter; they could travel backward in time. The trajectory of an hypothetical particle beconing tachyonic and exiting the light cone is depicted in Fig. 3.1. We will regard tachyon trajectories as physically forbidden. The fact that an event can only influence events lying inside or along its future light cone gives rise to the notion of causality. If particles which can become tachyonic and travel outside their light cone could exist, the notion of cause and effect would be in jeopardy.

Let   be a spacetime point; the set of points causally connected to   (i.e., the set of spacetime points which can affect   or be affected by   via signals propagating at speed   form the light cone or null cone through  . This surface comprises

  * the future light cone, which is the set of all events that can be reached by   with light signals; and

  * the past light cone, which is the set of all events that can influence   from the past by sending light signals.

We also identify

  * the causal future   of  , which is the set of all events that can be influenced by   through signals travelling2 at speeds  ; and the

  * the causal past   of  , the set of all events which can influence   from the past by sending signals travelling3 at speeds  .

Let   be a set of points   in Minkowski spacetime; then   is the union of the causal futures [pasts] of the events   as   varies in  .

Although events that are simultaneous in an inertial frame are not simultaneous in other inertial frames, the notion of event   preceding event   cannot be altered by Lorentz boosts with  : if the time separation between two events is  , it will be   in any other inertial frame  . The concept of causality is then Lorentz-invariant. All inertial observers agree that a certain event is in the absolute future or past of   because the time interval   between   and this event has the same sign of   if  .

Formally, one can also consider the elsewhere, the complement of the causal past and causal future  of  . This set consists of all the events which cannot be connected with   by signals travelling at speed  . Different observers disagree that an event in the elsewhere of   is in the past or the future of  . Events in the elsewhere of   have no causal connection with  .

## 3.3 Spacetime Diagrams

Consider an   diagram obtained by suppressing the   and   directions in Minkowski spacetime in Cartesian coordinates and setting   (spacetime or Minkowski diagram).4 The space   at a constant time is represented by a straight line parallel to the  -axis (a "moment of time"), see Fig. 3.2. A point of space is represented by a vertical line of constant   (with the convention that one can only move forward in time, or upward along this line).

Fig. 3.2

The worldline of a particle which is stationary at   in the inertial frame  , and a moment of time

Consider another inertial frame  , which has axes   and  : since  , the "moment of time"   in   corresponds to

in  , which is represented by a straight line with slope   and intercept at the origin  . The  -axis of equation   corresponds to

(3.7)

The line   in the   frame corresponds to (using  )

In particular, the  -axis of equation   corresponds to

(3.8)

The  -axis and the  -axis given by Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8), represented by lines with slopes   and   which are the inverse of each other, are symmetric with respect to the diagonal   (Fig. 3.3). The  \- and  -axes can make any angle between   and  .

Fig. 3.3

Two inertial frames   and  . The  \- and  -axes are symmetric with respect to the line

Since in these spacetime diagrams we use units in which  , a light ray travelling at speed   is represented by a line at   with the coordinate axes. For example, two photons travelling along the positive or negative  -axis, respectively, and going through   at the time   are represented by the lines   (since objects can only travel forward in time, in the following we will often omit the arrows denoting the time direction).

A point of coordinates   in a spacetime diagram is an event; the history of a point-like particle is described by its spacetime trajectory, called a worldline. The history of an extended object is described by a worldtube, the collection of all the worldlines of the constituent particles. Worldlines in the   plane can be given by an equation of the form  , or  , or by a parametric representation   in terms of a parameter   (for massive particles, this is usually taken to be the proper time   along the worldline). Since   is an absolute barrier in Special Relativity and no particle or physical signal travels faster than light, their worldlines have tangents with slopes larger than, or equal to, unity in the   plane.

Spacetime diagrams are useful to visualize simple processes in Special Relativity, for example, the emission of two consecutive light pulses from an inertial observer   and its reception and reflection back to   from a mirror located at   are described by Fig. 3.4, in which   is moving with constant velocity away from   in standard configuration.

Fig. 3.4

Spacetime diagram of two light signals emitted by  , arriving at  , and reflected back to  .   is at rest in the   frame, while   moves with constant velocity

The worldline of a massive particle which is accelerated in coordinates   will be a curve which is not straight (Fig. 3.5). Since   at all times for a massive particle, the tangent to its worldline will always have slope larger than unity.

Fig. 3.5

The worldline of an accelerated particle

Since the squared interval is invariant under Lorentz transformations,

(3.9)

it is of interest to draw the hyperbolae (in units  )

(3.10)

these curves coincide with the hyperbolae   and always intersect the axes at unit values of  , or   (Fig. 3.6).

Fig. 3.6

The invariant hyperbolae   asymptotic to the lines

The Lorentz transformation (2.​1)–(2.​4) allows us to conclude that:

  * the  -axis of equation   is the straight line   of slope   in units in which  .

  * The  -axis of equation   is the straight line of equation   with slope larger than unity (when  ). This is the line symmetric to the  -axis with respect to the diagonal   in the   plane. It is also the worldline of an observer at rest in the   frame, which has zero 3-dimensional velocity in this frame but for which time keeps going on.

  * The lines parallel to the  -axis are the worldlines of particles at rest with fixed   coordinate in  . The lines parallel to the  -axis are lines of constant   (lines of simultaneity of  ).

  * The  \- and  -axes make equal angles, but measured in opposite directions, with the line   (in units  , of course). As   gets closer and closer to  , these axes get closer and closer to the symmetry line   in the spacetime diagram, and they merge with it in the limit  . Formally this line is an invariant of the Lorentz transformation: .

Note that the  \- and  -axes do not appear perpendicular in the   plane in which the observer   is not at rest. Also, the length scales along the axes are not the same. To relate a length on the  -axis to that on the  -axis we use the invariant hyperbolae (3.10) (see Fig. 3.7). Since these hyperbolae intersect the axes at unit length, the intersection of this curve with the  -axis mapped into its intersection with the  -axis gives the unit of length in  , which can be used to calibrate lengths. The same procedure applies to the time axes   and  .

Fig. 3.7

A segment of unit length on the  -axis corresponds to a segment of different length (1') on the  -axis, given by its intersection with the invariant hyperbola

Fig. 3.8

The coordinates   of an event   in the inertial frame   are obtained geometrically by projecting   parallel to the  \- and  -axes

The coordinates   in   of an event of coordinates   in   can be obtained by projecting the event parallel to the coordinate axes   and   (Fig. 3.8).

It is now easy to understand graphically why two events that are simultaneous in the inertial frame   are not simultaneous in another inertial frame   (Fig. 3.9). Simultaneous events according to   all lie on a horizontal line   const. in the   plane. Projecting two events   and   lying on this line parallel to the  -axis yields two distinct intersections with the  -axis, i.e., two events which are not simultaneous according to  .

## 3.4 Conclusion

The 4-dimensional world view provides much insight into the essence of Special Relativity, the intimate relations between space and time, the momentum and energy of a particle or of a physical system, the wave vector and the frequency of a wave, and the electric and magnetic fields. Before we uncover these relations, which we have just begun to see, we need to become acquainted with the necessary mathematics: the formalism of tensors.

Abstract

At this point it is of great advantage to use the language of tensors applied to the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Tensors are mathematical objects, described by their components in a given coordinate system, which separate true geometric and physical properties from properties that are specific to certain coordinate systems and only valid there. The formalism of tensors is constructed by studying how tensorial quantities transform under coordinate changes and, since Special Relativity is based on changes of inertial frame (the Lorentz transformations) which are coordinate changes, it is natural to use 4-tensors to formulate Special Relativity. The formalism of tensors, however, is not specific to Special Relativity; it is used in many other areas of physics. For example, tensors occur in the study of the Newtonian mechanics of rigid bodies, fluids, elasticity, electromagnetism, and diffusion. This chapter is quite general and does not refer specifically to tensors in Special Relativity. The adaptation of the formalism to Minkowski spacetime and to spacetime quantities will be discussed in the next chapter.

Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.

## 4.1 Introduction

At this point it is of great advantage to use the language of tensors applied to the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Tensors are mathematical objects, described by their components in a given coordinate system, which separate true geometric and physical properties from properties that are specific to certain coordinate systems and only valid there. The formalism of tensors is constructed by studying how tensorial quantities transform under coordinate changes and, since Special Relativity is based on changes of inertial frame (the Lorentz transformations) which are coordinate changes, it is natural to use 4-tensors to formulate Special Relativity. The formalism of tensors, however, is not specific to Special Relativity; it is used in many other areas of physics. For example, tensors occur in the study of the Newtonian mechanics of rigid bodies, fluids, elasticity, electromagnetism, and diffusion. This chapter is quite general and does not refer specifically to tensors in Special Relativity. The adaptation of the formalism to Minkowski spacetime and to spacetime quantities will be discussed in the next chapter.

## 4.2 Vectors and Tensors

In various areas of non-relativistic physics one encounters 3-dimensional tensors. They generalize the notion of vector and, at a first glance, they look to the student as "symbols with two or more indices" as opposed to vectors which have only one index, or scalars which have no indices. In order to understand tensors, we first need to revisit the notion of vector. A 3-dimensional vector is usually defined as an element of the 3-dimensional real vector space   (a quantity characterized by its magnitude and direction) and can be represented on a basis of this vector space by giving all its components. For example, by choosing the orthonormal basis of unit vectors   and projecting along the  -,  -, and  -axes, respectively, a vector   can be represented by means of its components in Cartesian coordinates  ,

(4.1)

i.e., it is equivalent to use the symbol   or the coordinate representation   (where  ). We are familiar with operations on a vector or between vectors, such as the multiplication   of a vector   by a scalar  , the addition and subtraction   of two vectors   and  , the scalar product  , and the vector product  .

A simple example of a 2-index tensor can be constructed by taking the product of the components   of a vector   and   of a vector  : the symbol   denotes the components of this "bivector", which can be represented by the   matrix

(4.2)

Similarly, one can construct the tensor   out of the vectors  , and  , and so on. These objects, however, are very special tensors and the most general tensor cannot be obtained as a product of vector components.

Another example of a tensor is obtained by differentiating a vector field  , i.e., a vector that is a function of the position   in space (both its magnitude and direction can change from point to point, together with its components  , which are functions of the position). One can consider the 2-index object

(4.3)

and indeed such objects are used, for example, in fluid dynamics and field theory. If   is the velocity field in a fluid, the velocity gradient tensor

(4.4)

can be considered at any point, along with the shear tensor

(4.5)

and the vorticity tensor

(4.6)

Another example of a 3-dimensional tensor encountered in electromagnetism is the Maxwell stress tensor, defined by

(4.7)

where   and   are the electric and magnetic field, respectively. This 3-dimensional tensor is analogous to the tensor describing stresses in an elastic medium or pressures in a (possibly viscous) fluid. Yet another example occurring in a continuous medium or in a fluid is encountered when a 2-dimensional surface in the medium is identified by its unit normal   and a force   acts on it, in general not parallel to  . Let   be a vector with magnitude equal to an element   of area with unit normal   and with the direction of  . Then the  -th component of the force acting on   is  , where   is the stress tensor.

One can change the coordinates   used in the space   and correspondingly change the basis of unit vectors   associated with the coordinates:   and   (in fact, one could also consider a new basis of vectors not associated with a coordinate system). By doing this, the components of a vector   will change,  . The vector itself is a geometric object which exists independent of the coordinates used in the space in which it lives, whereas a coordinate representation of   (for example   in Cartesian coordinates  ) depends on the coordinates used. Under a coordinate change the components of   transform in a well-specified way which will be used below as a definition of vector and later generalized to define a tensor. It is not obvious why an object (vector, tensor, etc.) should be defined according to the way in which it transforms under coordinate changes, even though it seems reasonable that its properties under coordinate changes may characterize it. There is, in fact, a more direct and geometric way of characterizing vectors and tensors, which can be proven to be equivalent to the one based on coordinate transformations which we will use. However, the price to pay for this alternative definition is a higher degree of abstraction which, although appealing to the mathematician, is less attractive for the beginning physics student and we will not base our discussion on it. Before proceeding to define vectors and tensors in the space   (where  ), let us introduce some notations and conventions universally adopted in relativity.

### 4.2.1 Coordinate Transformations

Let   be a coordinate system on  , or on an open region of   and let   be another coordinate system on  , or on the same open region, and consider the coordinate change

(4.8)

The transformation matrix is the   matrix

(4.9)

and its determinant (called Jacobian of the transformation) is

(4.10)

It must be   in order for the transformation to be one-to-one and invertible (i.e., to be an admissible coordinate transformation), which guarantees the existence of the inverse transformation

(4.11)

with Jacobian determinant

(4.12)

Now differentiate the equation  :

(4.13)

Vice-versa, by differentiating the inverse relation  , one obtains

(4.14)

### 4.2.2 Einstein Convention

We adopt the Einstein summation convention according to which the summation symbol   is dropped every time that an index is repeated, appearing once in a lowered and once in a raised position. For example,   denotes   and

Example 4.1

Let   and   be two vectors in  . Then

* * *

The repeated index is a dummy index and its name is unimportant: it can be changed at will, for example

and

Often, one needs to change the name of a dummy index in order to avoid repetition and ambiguities, for example the expression   is unclear and is to be avoided because one does not know whether the first or the second index of the tensor   is contracted with that of the vector  . If it is the second index of   which is contracted, one should write instead  . An index that is not repeated (e.g.,   in   or   in  ) is called a free index. We will also use the Kronecker delta

(4.15)

For example, we have

and

The chain rule of differentiation is

(4.16)

and

A useful relation in a space of dimension   is

(4.17)

## 4.3 Contravariant and Covariant Vectors

Definition 4.1

A contravariant vector (or contravariant tensor of rank 1) is a set of   components   in a specified coordinate system   that transform according to

(4.18)

under the coordinate change  .

The vector is a geometric object defined independently of the coordinate system, while its components   change with the coordinate system adopted and merely constitute a representation of that vector on a certain basis. A vector can be represented by an   column  .

* * *

Example 4.2

The differentials of the coordinates   transform as contravariant vectors:

(4.19)

which is the reason why we conventionally write the coordinates   using superscripts and not subscripts.

Example 4.3

The position vector   of a particle in three dimensions has coordinate components   in a Cartesian coordinate system. The velocity vector   of the same particle has components  . Under the change from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates   with

(4.20)

the vector components transform according to

(4.21)

Let us compute the transformation matrix of this coordinate change:

therefore,

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

Definition 4.2

A covariant vector (or dual vector, 1-form, or covariant tensor of rank 1) is a set of   components   (note the position of the index) that transform according to

(4.25)

under the coordinate change  .

Example 4.4

If a contravariant vector in   is represented in Cartesian coordinates by an   column  , the dual vector can be represented by an   row  .

Example 4.5

The gradient of a scalar function   is a covariant or dual vector. In fact,

(4.26)

Now we can consider quantities with two or more indices.

## 4.4 Contravariant and Covariant Tensors

Definition 4.3

A contravariant tensor of rank 2 is a set of   components   which transform according to

(4.27)

under the coordinate change  .

A 2-tensor can be represented by a   matrix

(4.28)

Example 4.6

The vectors   and   can be used to form the bivector  , which can be represented by the matrix

(4.29)

Definition 4.4

A covariant tensor of rank 2 is a set of   components   which transform according to

(4.30)

under the transformation  .

Example 4.7

The second derivative of a scalar function   is not a covariant 2-index tensor. In fact, it is

(4.31)

Unless   is a linear transformation or   constant, which are degenerate cases, we have   and

(4.32)

This example shows that not all objects with indices are tensors, i.e., they do not transform as tensors under coordinate changes.

Definition 4.5

A contravariant tensor of rank   is a set of   components   which transform according to

(4.33)

under the coordinate change  .

Definition 4.6

A covariant tensor of rank   is a set of   components   which transform according to

(4.34)

under the coordinate change  .

Example 4.8

A scalar   (a  -index tensor) is a quantity that does not change under the coordinate transformation  :

(4.35)

For this reason, a scalar is also called an invariant.

Example 4.9

A vector is a contravariant tensor of rank 1:

(4.36)

while a dual vector is a covariant tensor of rank 1:

(4.37)

To summarize:

The coordinates themselves are usually written as   (and not as  ) because the position vector   with the coordinates as components is a contravariant vector. Scalars are tensors of rank 0, while vectors are tensors of rank 1. Finally,

Definition 4.7

a mixed tensor of contravariant rank   and covariant rank   is a set of   components   that transform according to

(4.38)

under the coordinate change  .

Example 4.10

  transforms according to

(4.39)

* * *

A tensor equation

(4.40)

holds in every coordinate system even though the components of the tensor appearing on both sides change (according to the rules that you now know). If the tensor equation is satisfied in one coordinate system, it is satisfied in any coordinate system. This statement can be rephrased by saying that, if all the components of a tensor (the left hand side minus the right hand side of a tensor equation) vanish in a certain coordinate system, then they vanish in any coordinate system. The proof of this statement is trivial for, if   in a certain coordinate system  , then in another coordinate system   it will be

If a free index appears on the left hand side of a tensor equation, a free index with the same name and in the same position must appear on the right hand side. For example,   is a correct equation, while   and   are wrong.

Physics must be expressed in terms of tensor equations.

Any coordinate transformation between inertial frames is in principle admissible and physics does not know about the coordinates used by humans (for us, a coordinate system can be more economical to perform calculations, e.g., spherical coordinates for a system with spherical symmetry such as the sun-earth system or the hydrogen atom, but that is another story which physics does not know). One wants the form of a physical law not to be tied to a particular coordinate system but, instead, that physical laws assume the same form in all coordinate systems. This desirable property is obtained if the laws of physics are expressed as tensor equations.

Example 4.11

The vector equation in three dimensions

is true in Cartesian coordinates   and it means

changing coordinates as in  , it is still true that

because the components of both   and   transform in the same way.

### 4.4.1 Tensor Symmetries

In general, the order of the indices in a tensor is important:   and  . However, certain multi-index tensors exhibit symmetry properties under permutation of their indices.

Definition 4.8

A tensor of rank 2 (covariant or contravariant)   or   is symmetric if

(4.41)

for all values of the indices   and  , and it is antisymmetric or skew-symmetric if

(4.42)

A rank 2 symmetric tensor in a space of dimension   has at most   independent components. An antisymmetric rank 2 tensor has at most   independent components and all diagonal components necessarily vanish in order to satisfy  .

A 2-index contravariant (or covariant) tensor can always be decomposed into a symmetric part   and an antisymmetric part   as follows:

(4.43)

where

(4.44)

and

(4.45)

are the symmetric part and the antisymmetric part of  , respectively. Eq. (4.43) is a trivial identity, but

the decomposition   is unique

(the proof is left as an exercise).

In general, the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of a tensor   are defined by

(4.46)

(4.47)

(remember that the number of permutations of   objects is  ). For example, a 3-index tensor   has symmetric part

(4.48)

and antisymmetric part

(4.49)

A totally symmetric [antisymmetric] tensor is one equal to its symmetric [antisymmetric] part. Tensors of rank higher than 2 can posses symmetries with respect to pairs of indices, for example   or  . The symmetry of a tensor is preserved by coordinate transformations or, in relativity language, it is an invariant property.

Example 4.12

The shear tensor (4.5) is, by construction, symmetric while the vorticity tensor (4.6) is antisymmetric. The Kronecker delta   is symmetric.

* * *

The notation denoting symmetrization or antisymmetrization of indices is used also for indices belonging to different tensors, for example:

or

## 4.5 Tensor Algebra

Definition 4.9

The multiplication of a   tensor by a   tensor (called direct product) produces a tensor of type   with components equal to the product of the components

(4.50)

Example 4.13

Using the tensors   and  , one constructs the direct product

Definition 4.10

The contraction of two indices of a tensor   reduces its rank by 2 and is defined by

(4.51)

a tensor of type   in which a pair of indices is reduced to two dummy indices.

Example 4.14

Consider the 4-index tensor   and contract the first and third index:

this operation reduces the rank by two, from a   tensor to a   tensor.

* * *

The contraction is equivalent to multiplication by a Kronecker delta:

Another operation that one can do on a multi-index tensor is taking the trace.

Definition 4.11

The trace of a mixed tensor   of type   is

(4.52)

and is a scalar.

Any antisymmetric 2-index tensor is trace-free, i.e., its trace vanishes.

Example 4.15

The trace of the velocity gradient tensor   is the divergence   of the vector  . The shear tensor (4.5) is trace-free by construction,  , while the vorticity tensor (4.6) is trace-free because it is antisymmetric.

Example 4.16

The trace of the Kronecker delta   is equal to the dimension   of the space:

(4.53)

Definition 4.12

The sum of two tensors of the same type   and   is the tensor of the same type

(4.54)

(i.e., the sum of tensors is defined by adding the components).

The sum of two tensors transforms in the same way as the two tensors   and  :

In the same way, one defines the subtraction of two tensors of the same type as

(4.55)

and the multiplication of a tensor by a scalar

(4.56)

Taking the inverse of the components of a tensor does not create a tensor, in the same way that the writing   is not defined for a vector   in the Euclidean space   and   are not the components of a vector.

## 4.6 Tensor Fields

A vector or a tensor are constant quantities: they are defined at a point   and are analogous to constant functions. However, one can let the point   vary spanning a region of  , thus obtaining vector fields or tensor fields, in the same way that by varying the position   of the point   one obtains a function  . Tensor fields are tensors whose values depend on the position,  .

Example 4.17

The electric and magnetic fields of Maxwell's theory   and   depend on both space and time, as does the velocity field of a fluid  .

Definition 4.13

A continuous tensor field on a region   is one such that all its components   are continuous functions of the coordinates   at all points of  .

Definition 4.14

Let   be an open region; then a differentiable,   tensor field is one whose components are all differentiable,   on  , respectively.

Definition 4.15

A smooth tensor field on   is one such that its components are   (i.e., it is differentiable with all its derivatives of all orders on  ).

One can introduce tensor calculus by taking derivatives, gradients, etc. of sufficiently regular tensor fields. Common notations for tensor fields include

(4.57)

(4.58)

In general, however,

the partial derivative of a tensor is not a tensor.

In fact, consider how the partial derivative   of a tensor   transforms:

(4.59)

because of the second last line, the tensor transformation property is spoiled. It is preserved only by linear transformations for which   and   vanish.

Higher order partial derivatives of a tensor also do not transform as tensors (except under linear coordinate transformations). Therefore, we will need to define a new notion of derivative ("covariant derivative" ) such that, in this new sense, "derivatives" of tensors are tensors. This definition is given in Chap. .

Consider a differentiable curve in   (for example the worldline of a particle in Minkowski spacetime) given by a parametric representation

with parameter   (a scalar, invariant under coordinate transformations). Then the tangent   to the curve is a contravariant vector under arbitrary coordinate transformations. In fact, under the change  , it is

(4.60)

The basic vectors of special-relativistic mechanics that we will use in the next few chapters, 4-velocity, 4-acceleration, 4-momentum and 4-force, are constructed using only differentiation with respect to a parameter and, possibly, multiplication by the particle mass, which is another scalar:

are true vectors. However, the total derivative

(4.61)

of a tensor   with respect to the scalar parameter   is a tensor with respect to linear transformations only.

Example 4.18

In fluid mechanics in   the velocity of a fluid particle   is a vector field. The tensor with components

(4.62)

in Cartesian coordinates   is a 2-tensor and is decomposed into a symmetric part   and an antisymmetric part   as

(4.63)

with symmetric part

(expansion tensor) and antisymmetric part

(vorticity tensor). The symmetric part of   is further decomposed into a trace-free part and a pure trace part as

(4.64)

where   is the trace of   and

The shear tensor   is symmetric and trace-free,

The action of the tensors  ,  , and   on a sphere of particles in the fluid describes the deformations occurring during the motion in an infinitesimal time interval  . Consider a sphere of fluid particles at time   (Fig. 4.1); then at time   the expansion  will have increased its volume without deformation or rotation. If only the shear  is non-zero, it will have deformed the sphere into an ellipsoid without changing its volume or rotating it; if only the vorticity  is different from zero it will have rotated the sphere of particles without changing its shape or its volume.

Fig. 4.1

The action of the expansion, shear, and vorticity tensors on a sphere of fluid particles

## 4.7   Index-Free Description of Tensors

For the reader who is not satisfied with the previous definition of tensor based on coordinate transformations, we provide in this section a more abstract characterization of covariant vector fields, which can be generalized to define tensors of any type. However, we will not make use of this new definition and of this geometric approach in this book.1

One can think of vectors and tensors as geometric objects defined in a way independent of their components and without referring to these. Think of a vector field   on a region   as an operator acting on functions defined on that region. For each such function  , the operator produces another function

with   linear,

Clearly   is a geometric map defined independently of the coordinates. Let us relate it now to coordinates. Let   be a coordinate system on   and consider the operators (vectors)

(4.65)

acting on functions regular on  ; then define the components   of   by

With this definition, for any smooth function   on  , the vector   is

where   are the components of the vector   with respect to the basis (4.65) (coordinate basis). In another coordinate system   it is

Now, for the vector   to remain an object defined independently of the coordinates, the components   must transform according to  ; then it is

so

which makes it clear that the vector   is defined in a way independent of the coordinate system although its components with respect to a coordinate basis are not. By considering as operations on vectors the usual multiplication by a scalar and addition of two vectors, the vectors   form a vector space of operators with dimension   (tangent space) denoted by   or  , a basis of which (coordinate basis) is given by the vectors

Let us consider now the set of linear maps   which associate real numbers to vectors of the tangent space. These maps can be added and multiplied by a scalar and, with these two operations, the set of all such linear maps forms a vector space, called dual space of   or cotangent space, denoted by   or  . The operations of sum and multiplication by a scalar are defined, as usual, by

The elements of the cotangent space are called dual vectors or 1-forms.2 The basis of the tangent space  induces a basis

of   as follows. For any vector   and for any dual vector  , it is

By denoting

we have

and

By defining the 1-forms   so that

(4.66)

we have, for any 1-form  ,

(4.67)

so   are the components of the 1-form   on the basis  . A widely used notation for the dual basis of the cotangent space is  , which emphasizes the duality between vectors and 1-forms.

It would be equivalent to study three-dimensional physics using vectors   or dual vectors  .

Definition 4.16

A tensor of type   is an operator   acting on the   tensor products of   with itself times   tensor products of   with itself and producing a real number,

which is linear in all its arguments.

The tensors of type   form a vector space denoted by   with the usual operations of addition and multiplication by a scalar. A basis of this space is obtained by taking   outer products of the basis vectors of   and   outer products of the dual vectors forming the induced basis of  . Such a tensor   has components   which satisfy

(4.68)

A coordinate change   induces the change of bases in   and

or

while the respective tensor components must transform in the opposite way to keep the geometric object   invariant. Since

the equality of   and   is guaranteed if the components transform according to Eq. (4.38); then

It is clear that the definition of vector, 1-form, and tensor are given in a coordinate-independent way and that one needs to use coordinates only to specify the components with respect to assigned bases of   and  . In practice, however, many calculations are performed more conveniently in coordinates than in abstract coordinate-free notation.

One can define the tangent space at any point of the  -dimensional space and, by varying the point, a vector in the tangent space becomes a vector field and tensors depending on the position become tensor fields.

Let   and   be vector fields. The commutator (or Lie bracket) of   and   is the vector field

(4.69)

which is defined as follows. For any smooth test function  ,

Now consider, e.g., the term  : since   is a smooth function,

and

because   (the contraction of an antisymmetric tensor with a symmetric one is always zero) and

Now, it is   and we are left with

and

The commutator satisfies the properties (the proof of which is left as an exercise)

(4.70)

(4.71)

(4.72)

If   and   are two vector fields of a coordinate basis  , they always commute:

This property follows from the fact that for any smooth test function   it is  . Conversely, given a collection   of non-vanishing vector fields which commute with each other and are linearly independent, one can always find a coordinate system   for which they are coordinate basis vector fields. However, not all bases    of   are coordinate bases, i.e., not always there is a coordinate system such that

(4.73)

In fact, for a basis to be a coordinate basis it must be   for all vectors of the basis because, if  , then for any regular function it is  .

Example 4.19

The gradient of a scalar   is the covariant vector

and the differential   is the contraction of the covariant vector of components   and of  . In 3-dimensional notation we have  .

## 4.8 The Metric Tensor

A special tensor of type  , the metric tensor or simply "the metric", provides us with the notions of distance between points and of norm of a vector and introduces a significant amount of structure on what is otherwise a set of points with only tensor fields defined on it.3

Definition 4.17

A metric is a tensor field   of type   which is

  * symmetric,    ;

  * non-degenerate, i.e.,    .

The infinitesimal distance squared between two points of coordinates   and  , or line element (squared), is

(4.74)

Definition 4.18

The scalar product between two vectors   and   is4

Definition 4.19

Two vectors are orthogonal if their scalar product is zero.

In particular, if  , one has the notion of length squared of a vector

Example 4.20

In   with Cartesian coordinates  , the Euclidean metric is given by

The distance squared between two infinitesimally close points   and   is

(4.75)

the Pythagorean theorem in   dimensions. The Euclidean metric is positive-definite since   and   if and only if  . The scalar product between two vectors defined by   is the usual dot product. In Cartesian coordinates, we have

and the length squared of a vector   is

(4.76)

and is non-negative.

### 4.8.1 Inverse Metric

Let the metric tensor   be represented by a matrix of elements   in some coordinate system. Since the metric is non-degenerate, the inverse matrix exists. Denote its elements by  ; since   is symmetric, so is  . The tensor represented by the matrix   is called the inverse metric of   and by definition satisfies the relation

(4.77)

This tensor equation is valid in any coordinate system: in fact, if   is a coordinate transformation, we have

The equation   in the coordinate system   defines uniquely the inverse of the matrix  .

The metric tensor allows one to define the algebraic tensor operations consisting of raising and lowering tensor indices.

Definition 4.20

Let   be a contravariant vector; we define

(4.78)

If   is a covariant vector we define

(4.79)

The raising of a lowered index and the lowering of a raised index give back the original object:

The operations of raising or lowering apply to any tensor index, for example

  and   are just different descriptions of the same object because it is always possible to obtain one from the other by lowering or raising indices with the metric   or the inverse metric  . In particular, Eq. (4.77) expresses the fact that the Kronecker delta is the mixed form of the metric tensor  .

The scalar product of two vectors   and   can now be written as5

and, for example,  .

The symmetries of a tensor are conserved by raising/lowering its indices:

if and only if

(the proof is left as an exercise).

Example 4.21

Consider, in three dimensions, a deformable medium in a state of rest and let   be the position of a generic point   in it. If the body is subject to stresses, it deforms so that the point   moves to  . Let   be the displacement vector of the point  . At a nearby point   of position

at rest, the displacement is

(4.81)

The symmetric part of the tensor  , i.e.,

(4.82)

is important in continuum mechanics. For the point  ,

or, in components,

(4.83)

where   is the displacement gradient and   is the deformation gradient. We have, for infinitesimal distances within the medium,

(4.84)

(the deformation does not preserve distances between points, which makes it clear that we are discussing a non-rigid body). The deformation is described by

or, in components,

where

(4.85)

is the (symmetric) deformation tensor.

### 4.8.2 Metric Determinant

The metric tensor in   is represented by an   symmetric non-degenerate matrix and the metric determinant   is the determinant of this matrix

(4.86)

The requirement that the metric tensor be non-degenerate implies that the matrix associated with this tensor in any given basis is non-singular, i.e.,

This property guarantees the existence of the inverse (or contravariant) metric   represented, in any coordinate system by the inverse matrix   of  .

## 4.9 The Levi-Civita Symbol and Tensor Densities

Definition 4.21

The Levi-Civita (or alternating) symbol in three dimensions is defined as

(4.87)

Remember that a permutation of 123 is an ordering of the set   obtained by starting with the natural order 123 and exchanging only two digits at a time, once or several times. An even (odd) permutation is one that requires an even (odd) number of such exchanges. It is useful to remember that there are   permutations of   numbers. The non-zero components of the Levi-Civita symbol  are, therefore,

We are particularly interested in the case  .

Definition 4.22

The Levi-Civita or alternating symbol in four dimensions is defined as

(4.88)

where a permutation of 0123 is an ordering of the set   obtained by starting with the natural order 0123 and exchanging only two digits at a time.

There are   permutations of four indices, which give the 24 components6

The Levi-Civita symbol transforms as a tensor only in   in Cartesian coordinates, but not in other coordinate systems (it is called a "symbol", not a tensor). In fact, it has the same components in any coordinate system, an unusual property. The Levi-Civita symbol is not a tensor, but a tensor density.

Definition 4.23

A tensor density in four dimensions7   is a quantity that transforms as

(4.89)

where   is the weight of the density.

From a tensor density   of weight  , one can obtain a tensor by multiplying it by the power of the absolute value of the metric determinant  ;

(4.90)

is a tensor because   is a scalar density of weight  .

The Levi-Civita symbol is a tensor density of weight  , while the metric determinant   is a (scalar) density of weight  .

Proof

Let   be an invertible   matrix, then

(4.91)

an expression valid for the determinant of any   matrix in linear algebra. In particular, we can choose   as the inverse matrix of the transformation  , or  ; then

(4.92)

using the fact that  , we have

(4.93)

hence the levi-Civita symbol is a tensor density of weight 1.

The determinant of the metric tensor is also a tensor density; we have

(4.94)

and taking the determinant of both sides and using the fact that the determinant of a matrix product is the product of the determinants,

or

Hence,   is a (scalar) density of weight  .

Now, Eq. (4.92) tells us that the Levi-Civita symbol   transforms as a tensor density because of the factor   in the right hand side of this equation. However, if we consider the quantity

(4.95)

this transforms according to

i.e., as a true tensor. In general, we can obtain a tensor from a tensor density by multiplying by the appropriate power of  . If   is a tensor density of weight   then

is a tensor.

### 4.9.1 Properties of the Levi-Civita Symbol in Four Dimensions

By raising indices with the inverse metric we can define   and

(4.96)

Contraction gives

(4.97)

(4.98)

(4.99)

(4.100)

Finally, if   is an antisymmetric 2-index tensor, its dual is the tensor density

(4.101)

The Levi-Civita symbol in three dimensions with the Euclidean metric can be used to define the cross-product of 3-vectors and the curl of 3-vector fields, as shown by the following examples.

Example 4.22

The cross-product of two vectors   and   in 3 dimensions in Cartesian coordinates can be expressed as  , where

(4.102)

In fact,   or

  or

and  , or

so the rule (4.102) coincides with the rule "  with i,j,k cyclic", or with the empirical rule

(4.103)

based on a pseudo-determinant.

Example 4.23

The 3-dimensional curl of a vector field   is defined as the pseudo-determinant

The curl can be defined as

In fact, we have

### 4.9.2 Volume Element

The volume element   in   dimensions does not transform as a tensor under coordinate transformations but as a tensor density because it involves the Jacobian of the transformation:

(4.104)

Using the fact that the determinant   of the metric tensor is a tensor density of weight  , it is easy to realize that the quantity   can be used to construct a covariant volume element. The quantity   is invariant:

(4.105)

and this is the "correct" volume element to use in relativity.8 Therefore, a covariant expression of the integral of a function   over a region   of   is

(4.106)

and not simply  . Similarly, the volume element  will appear in the integral of tensorial quantities:

(4.107)

This property is not new: consider for example, the integral of a scalar function   over a region   in spherical coordinates  . The metric components in these coordinates are given by the line element

or

with  . The invariant volume element is   and the integral of the scalar   on a region   is

an expression familiar from elementary calculus.

## 4.10 Conclusion

The formalism of tensors has many applications to mathematics and physics and to science and technology in general. For us, its main advantage is that it allows the equations of physics to be formulated in a manner that is independent of particular coordinate systems (covariance). The invariance of the theory under changes of inertial frame is the essence of the Principle of Relativity, one of the only two pillars of the theory, and then it is clear that covariance is essential for Special Relativity and its equations must be formulated as tensor equations. In this sense, the formalism of tensors is particularly suited for Special Relativity. The restriction to inertial observers and inertial frames is eliminated in General Relativity, for which arbitrary coordinate transformations corresponding to arbitrary observers are possible, and the formalism of tensors becomes even more necessary there.

Abstract

After studying the general formalism of tensors, we can now apply it specifically to the 4-dimensional spacetime arena. A fundamental addition to the general baggage of tensors is the causal character of 4-vectors in Minkowski spacetime, which is due to the Lorentzian signature of the Minkowski metric. As a consequence of this signature, the line element is not positive-definite and we already know that this feature is linked to the existence of light cones, which play a crucial role because they determine the causal structure of the theory. Moreover, some specific notation which was not used in the general discussion of tensors applies to the Minkowski spacetime of Special Relativity.

Make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.

## 5.1 Introduction

After studying the general formalism of tensors, we can now apply it specifically to the 4-dimensional spacetime arena. A fundamental addition to the general baggage of tensors is the causal character of 4-vectors in Minkowski spacetime, which is due to the Lorentzian signature of the Minkowski metric. As a consequence of this signature, the line element is not positive-definite and we already know that this feature is linked to the existence of light cones, which play a crucial role because they determine the causal structure of the theory. Moreover, some specific notation which was not used in the general discussion of tensors applies to the Minkowski spacetime of Special Relativity.

## 5.2 Vectors and Tensors in Minkowski Spacetime

Let us consider now Minkowski spacetime and label the coordinates with the indices  , and  . The index 0 refers to the time coordinate. For example, in Cartesian coordinates, it is

(5.1)

We adopt the convention that Greek indices assume the values   and label spacetime quantities while Latin indices assume the values   and label spatial quantities. A contravariant vector in Minkowski spacetime is simply called a 4-vector and has components

  is the time component while   are the space components which, together, form a 3-vector   with respect to purely spatial coordinate transformations   (here  ). However,   does not transform as a vector under 4-dimensional coordinate transformations.

Example 5.1

The position 4-vector is  , and the gradient of a scalar function   is  .

A contravariant 4-tensor of rank 2 is a set of   quantities that transform like the product of components of two 4-vectors

etc. The coordinate changes that we are interested in are mostly the Lorentz transformations between inertial frames with constant relative velocity (in standard configuration or otherwise), but one could transform from an inertial to an accelerated or rotating frame as well.

## 5.3 The Minkowski Metric

Let   be Cartesian coordinates in Minkowski spacetime. The spacetime interval between nearby points of coordinates   and   is

(5.2)

We stick to this quantity because we know that it is left invariant by Lorentz transformations, which we have adopted as the fundamental symmetries of Special Relativity following the lesson coming from Maxwell's electromagnetism. By contrast, the usual Euclidean distance (squared) between two spatial points  , or their time separation (squared)  , are not invariant under Lorentz transformations.

The infinitesimal interval, or line element of Minkowski spacetime   can be obtained by introducing the metric tensor which, in Cartesian coordinates, has the components. 1

(5.3)

(Minkowski metric in Cartesian coordinates) and contracting it twice with the coordinate differentials  :

thus

(5.4)

In this sense, the Minkowski metric introduces the notion of distance between two points in spacetime. If the two points   are not at infinitesimal distance, the finite spacetime interval in Cartesian coordinates is given by

(5.5)

where  .

The line element is not positive-definite because of the negative sign in the time-time component   of the Minkowski metric ( 5.3). This feature is absolutely necessary in order to introduce the notion of causality in Special Relativity and the notion of a limiting speed  . As already remarked, two points separated by a null interval   can be related by a signal traveling at the speed of light:

Considering, for simplicity, a configuration such that   (points on the  -axis), it is   for this signal, or

i.e., a signal travelling along the positive or negative  -axis and connecting two points   and   with   must necessarily travel at speed  , and vice-versa.

The Lorentzian signature   of the metric makes it clear that time is treated differently from space, although they both concur to build spacetime.

A metric tensor is positive-definite (or a Riemannian metric) if   for any non-zero vector  . Note that the convention on the metric signature is not unique. Several textbooks use the opposite signature   for relativity, the physics being, of course, unchanged.

Example 5.2

Thus far, we have reasoned in Cartesian coordinates. However, it is clear that the components of a metric tensor will change if we change coordinates. Consider, as an example, the 3-dimensional space   with the Euclidean metric   and the change from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates

We want to compute the components of the Euclidean metric tensor   in these cylindrical coordinates. We begin by writing the Euclidean line element in

and by differentiating the inverse coordinate transformation  ,

Substituting into the expression of  , we obtain

Since   is a tensor equation and is true in any coordinate system, we have that

and, therefore, the components   of the Euclidean metric in cylindrical coordinates   can be read off as

(5.6)

Example 5.3

Consider the surface of a sphere of radius   and centre in the origin of  . We want to compute the metric induced by   on this 2-dimensional sphere using spherical coordinates  . The coordinate transformation   has inverse

with   const. on the surface of the given sphere. The Euclidean 3-dimensional metric in Cartesian coordinates has components   and produces the line element between two infinitesimally nearby points

Now express the differentials   on the surface of the sphere in terms of the differentials of   and  :

hence,

By calling   the restriction of the Euclidean metric   to the 2-sphere of radius  , we can write the line element on this 2-sphere as

(5.7)

or

(5.8)

in coordinates  . A widely used notation for the line element on the unit 2-sphere is

(5.9)

* * *

In Cartesian coordinates, the inverse Minkowski metric   is equal to  :

(5.10)

Let us update our definition of Minkowski spacetime: the Minkowski spacetime is the pair  , the set of all spacetime events endowed with the Minkowski metric  . This definition reflects the fact that it is not only the set of events   that matters, but also the metric with which it is endowed. The relations between spacetime points determined by this metric are more important than the events themselves.

The Minkowski metric in cylindrical coordinates   is given by

(5.11)

or

(5.12)

with

(5.13)

The Minkowski metric in spherical coordinates   is given by

(5.14)

or

(5.15)

(5.16)

In Minkowski spacetime the Minkowski metric   satisfies the requirement of non-singularity and the inverse metric   is well-defined. In Cartesian coordinates   we have  ,

and

## 5.4 Scalar Product and Length of a Vector in Minkowski Spacetime

In addition to the distance between spacetime points, the metric tensor provides the notion of scalar product between 4-vectors and that of length of a 4-vector in Minkowski spacetime. Remember that the scalar product between two vectors   and   is   and that the length squared of a vector   is the scalar product of   with itself  . In Minkowski spacetime, the length of a vector is not positive-definite because of the Lorentzian signature of the Minkowski metric. In Cartesian coordinates we have

This means that a vector can have zero length even if its components are not all zero. For example, the vectors with components

in Cartesian coordinates have length

These vectors are orthogonal to themselves but are not identically zero. Again, two vectors   are orthogonal if  .

Definition 5.1

If two vectors   have non-zero lengths, the angle   between   and   is defined by

(5.17)

Example 5.4

In  , the scalar product defined by the Euclidean metric   coincides with the ordinary dot product of vectors. In Cartesian coordinates, for two vectors  ,

(5.18)

the length squared of a vector   is

(5.19)

In cylindrical coordinates  , using the expression ( 5.12) we obtain

* * *

In the space   with Euclidean metric and in Cartesian coordinates, vector components with upper and lower indices are the same because the metric reduces to the Kronecker delta.2 For example,

Of course, this property is no longer true when non-Cartesian coordinates are used and  , or when a Lorentzian metric is used instead of the Euclidean one.

Example 5.5

Consider the 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime   with the Minkowski metric

in coordinates  . The vector   is not identically zero but

the same is true for the vector  . These two vectors identify the future light cone through the origin of this Minkowski space (Fig. 5.1).

Fig. 5.1

The null vectors   defining a cone (light cone) in 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime

Vectors which appear to have the same length in a   Minkowski diagram (suppressing two dimensions) do not necessarily have the same length according to the Minkowski metric. Similarly, vectors which appear to be orthogonal in the   spacetime diagram are not necessarily orthogonal in the sense of the Minkowski metric. Consider, for example   and  ; it is

but these two vectors appear orthogonal in a Minkowski diagram (Fig. 5.1). The representation in the spacetime diagram distorts four-dimensional lengths and angles. However, the sum of two vectors in the diagram corresponds to their sum in the sense of the Minkowski metric and the graphical notion of parallelism of two vectors (i.e.,   for some scalar   defines "  is parallel to  ") corresponds to parallelism in the sense of the Minkowski metric.

## 5.5 Raising and Lowering Tensor Indices

As we have seen, the metric   and the inverse metric   can be used to lower or raise tensor indices.

  * For any contravariant vector   we can define a corresponding covariant vector  .

  * For any covariant vector   we can define a corresponding contravariant vector  .

Similarly, any tensor index can be raised or lowered using   or  . For example, we can associate to the tensor   both   and  . If we want to lower the index   of the tensor  , we use   obtaining

(5.20)

  and   are two different representations of the same vector provided by  , and  .

In Minkowski spacetime a contravariant 4-vector in Cartesian coordinates is written as

and the corresponding covariant 4-vector (dual vector) is

Example 5.6

In Minkowski spacetime in Cartesian coordinates, find the components   and   of a tensor  .

We have

and

in particular, for   one has  .

* * *

The scalar product can also be used to define the divergence of a vector field   in the 3-dimensional space with Euclidean metric and in Cartesian coordinates:

which matches the familiar expression

Definition 5.2

The divergence of a 4-vector field   in Minkowski spacetime in Cartesian coordinates is

(5.21)

so

(5.22)

Definition 5.3

The d'Alembertian of a scalar field   is

(5.23)

in Cartesian coordinates,3 for which

(5.24)

where   is the usual Laplace operator in Cartesian coordinates.

The d'Alembertian used in wave mechanics (when the waves propagate at the speed of light  ) appears to be a straightforward generalization of the Laplacian to four dimensions with the Lorentzian signature.

The d'Alembertian of   coincides with the divergence of the gradient  , or  . This is analogous to the situation in three dimensions in which the Laplacian is the divergence of the gradient:  .

### 5.5.1 Working with Tensors in Minkowski Spacetime

From a 4-vector     one can obtain covariant components by lowering the indices with the Minkowski metric. In Cartesian coordinates  , it is

(5.25)

If   are two 4-vectors then

We have also

The transformation property of the components of a 4-vector   under Lorentz transformations in standard configuration is   with

(5.26)

(5.27)

(5.28)

(5.29)

as follows from  . For a covariant vector  , we have

(5.30)

(5.31)

(5.32)

(5.33)

according to  .

For higher rank tensors, one applies repeatedly the Lorentz matrix

  and its inverse, for example

## 5.6 Causal Nature of 4-Vectors

A vector   in Minkowski spacetime is

  * timelike if  ,

  * null or lightlike if  ,

  * spacelike if  .

A timelike or null vector is called a causal vector (Fig. 5.3).

The light cone (or null cone) at a spacetime point   is the set of null vectors at  . This is a vector space of dimension 2 and a surface in Minkowski space (and, as will be clear later, is generated by the tangents to ingoing and outgoing radial null rays at  ).

In Cartesian coordinates, a null vector satisfies

or

If   coincides with the Cartesian position 4-vector  , this is the equation of the double cone

(Fig. 5.2). Let  ; this unit vector points in the "direction of time" (the direction of the time axis) and has unit norm.

Fig. 5.2

The light cone through the spacetime point

A timelike or null vector   is

  * future-pointing if  , or

  * past-pointing if  .

Note that this definition involves a scalar product, therefore it is independent of the coordinate system used.

Let   be a timelike or null vector and let   be its components in a coordinate system  , with time (multiplied by  ) as the zeroth component. If  , then   is future-pointing, while if  ,   is past-pointing, and   is the projection of   on the time direction.

Fig. 5.3

A timelike vector at a spacetime point   points inside the light cone at  ; a null vector points along the light cone, and a spacelike vector points outside of it. The tangent to the worldline of a massive particle always points inside the light cone

Two causal vectors are called isochronous if they are both future-pointing or both past-pointing. This means that, if   and  , it is  .

Example 5.7

The 4-vector of components   is spacelike since

The 4-vector   is null since

The 4-vector   is timelike since

* * *

It is often convenient to choose an inertial frame which simplifies the calculations. The following results are useful to this regard:

  * if   is a timelike 4-vector, it is always possible to find an inertial frame in which  . This frame is unique.

  * For a spacelike 4-vector  , it is always possible to find an inertial frame in which the components reduce to  . This frame is unique.

  * (Zero component lemma) If a 4-vector has the same component (for example the time component) equal to zero in all inertial frames, it must be the zero vector  .

The proof of these statements is left as an exercise.

In a Minkowski diagram, the frame   has its time axis vertical and its  -axis horizontal and simultaneities (events occurring at the same time in this frame) form a horizontal straight line. All other inertial frames have apparently non-orthogonal  \- and  \- axes and simultaneities of these other frames are represented by oblique lines in the   plane. The apparent orthogonality has no physical significance because the physical metric is the Minkowski one, not the Euclidean metric upon which our intuition is built and which suggests orthogonality in the Euclidean sense. Taking different inertial frames corresponds to taking different time slices of Minkowski spacetime (which have different time axes) and with hyperplanes inclined with respect to the 3-spaces  const. of   (Fig. 5.4).

Fig. 5.4

Two slicings of Minkowski spacetime with two different times and 3-dimensional spaces

A null vector   can always be reduced to the form

(this is trivial to show: simply align the  -axis with  ). Note also that a null vector is defined up to a constant without affecting its normalization. If   is such that  , then  ,   is parallel to   and null:  . If   is future- or past-pointing one must choose the constant   positive in order for   to remain future- or past-pointing.

The following statements hold true, assuming that none of the null 4-vectors involved coincide with the trivial vector  :

  * The sum of two isochronous timelike 4-vectors is a timelike 4-vector isochronous with them.

  * The sum of a timelike 4-vector and an isochronous null 4-vector is a timelike 4-vector isochronous with both.

  * The sum of two isochronous null 4-vectors is a timelike 4-vector unless the two 4-vectors are parallel, in which case their sum is a null 4-vector.

  * The difference of two isochronous null 4-vectors is a spacelike 4-vector unless the two null 4-vectors are parallel, in which case their difference is a null 4-vector.

  * The sum of any number of isochronous null or timelike 4-vectors is a timelike or null 4-vector isochronous with them and it is null if and only if all the 4-vectors added are null and parallel.

  * Any timelike 4-vector can be expressed as the sum of two isochronous null 4-vectors.

  * Any spacelike 4-vector can be expressed as the difference of two isochronous null 4-vectors.

  * A timelike 4-vector cannot be orthogonal to a causal 4-vector.

  * A 4-vector orthogonal to a null 4-vector   must be spacelike, or else it is null and parallel or antiparallel to  .

  * Any 4-vector orthogonal to a causal 4-vector   is spacelike, or else it is a null 4-vector parallel to  .

  * The scalar product of two isochronous timelike 4-vectors is negative.

  * The scalar product of two isochronous null 4-vectors is negative unless they are parallel (in which case their product vanishes).

  * The scalar product of a timelike 4-vector and an isochronous null 4-vector is negative.

The proofs of these statements are left as exercises.

Definition 5.4

A curve   in Minkowski spacetime is a timelike/null/spacelike curve at a point if its 4-tangent   is timelike/null/spacelike, respectively, at that point. A timelike curve is one whose 4-tangent is everywhere timelike, etc., i.e., the causal character of a spacetime curve is the causal character of its tangent.

The worldline of a massive particle is a timelike curve, while a null ray (the spacetime trajectory of a photon) is a null curve.

Example 5.8

Consider the geometric curve   in Minkowski spacetime in Cartesian coordinates. The 4-tangent to this curve is

and its square is

We have   if   and the curve is spacelike for  , null at  , timelike for  , null again at  , and then spacelike again for   (this curve cannot be the worldline of a physical particle).

Example 5.9

Consider the curve with parametric representation

in Minkowski spacetime in Cartesian coordinates. The 4-tangent is

and its square is  . This curve is timelike.

Example 5.10

Consider the curve of parametric representation

in Minkowski spacetime in Cartesian coordinates. The 4-tangent is   and its square is  . This curve is always null (and, therefore, it could represent the worldline of a photon).

## 5.7 Hypersurfaces

Definition 5.5

A hypersurface in an  -dimensional space is a surface of dimension  . A hypersurface is

  * timelike if its normal   is spacelike,  ;

  * null if its normal   is null,  ;

  * spacelike if its normal   is timelike,  .

Example 5.11

Any hypersurface  constant is spacelike. In fact, the equation of the hypersurface is

The normal to this surface has the direction of the gradient of  ,

and is already normalized:

Example 5.12

Any hypersurface   constant is timelike. In fact, the equation of this surface is  . The normal has the direction of the gradient,

and is normalized,   and spacelike, hence   const. is a timelike hypersurface.

* * *

The null cone through any point of Minkowski spacetime is a null surface.

Proof

Let   in Cartesian coordinates (the result, however, will not depend on the coordinates adopted). The light cone through   has equation

The normal to this surface is or

while

so that

The null cone is a 2-dimensional surface.

Proof

The null cone through any point   of Minkowski spacetime is generated by only two linearly independent null vectors at that point. If   is a null vector at  , one can align the  -axis with   and then, in these coordinates, it is  . The normalization   yields   and  . These are all the null vectors at  . It is easy to see that   and   are linearly independent and, therefore, the null cone generated by them has dimension two.

## 5.8 Gauss' Theorem

Let   be a 4-dimensional simply connected region of Minkowski spacetime which has volume element   in Cartesian coordinates in which  . Let   be its 3-dimensional boundary with its own 3-dimensional volume element ("surface element")   associated with an outward-pointing normal  . This normal is assumed to be normalized, i.e., it has norm squared   if the surface is timelike,   if the surface is spacelike and, of course, zero if the surface is null. Let   be a 4-vector field defined in  . The Gauss theorem states that

(5.34)

Example 5.13

Consider the spacetime region

which is a"tube" formed by the region of 3-dimensional space enclosed by the sphere of radius  , with time spanning the entire  -axis. The boundary of this regions is

and the unit normal to   is

Consider the vector field

where   is a constant with the dimensions of an inverse time squared. The 4-divergence of   is

and its integral over the 4-region   is

Now compute the surface integral of the vector field   itself on the boundary  :

Therefore, Gauss' theorem   is verified.

## 5.9 Conclusion

Thus far, we have seen that a 4-dimensional world view is convenient and even necessary because a change of inertial frame mixes space and time coordinates, similar to the way in which spatial rotations in three dimensions mix different spatial coordinates. We have studied the geometry of Minkowski spacetime and it is now time to do physics in this spacetime. Physics must be given a relativistic (i.e., Lorentz-invariant) formulation. Beginning with mechanics, we know that Newton's second law is Galilei- but not Lorentz-invariant, and it must be modified. Maxwell's theory is already Lorentz-invariant and does not need to be modified, but only rewritten in the 4-dimensional formalism.

A physical theory will be expressed by basic physical laws which must be theoretically and experimentally consistent with our (limited) knowledge and must make new predictions which are falsifiable.4 Further, these laws must be expressed in a covariant way by tensor equations. We will only consider physics without gravity (gravity is included in General Relativity but not in Special Relativity) and with the stipulation that there exists a preferred class of reference frames, the inertial frames. We begin our study of physics in Minkowski spacetime by reformulating the mechanics of point particles (we know that Newtonian mechanics is not invariant under Lorentz boosts) and then moving on to geometric optics, fluid physics, and the physics of scalar and electromagnetic fields, while giving some general prescriptions applicable to any branch of physics whenever possible.

The relativistic corrections to Newtonian mechanics and their predictions were studied theoretically long before their experimental verification. Today, relativistic mechanics is the basis for the working of particle physics accelerators, nuclear power generation, the Global Positioning System, positron annihilation spectroscopy, and various tools used in medicine and the industry. Newtonian mechanics is adequate in the limit of small velocities  . In particle physics experiments, instead,  -factors of order   have been achieved and factors   are common in cosmic rays.

Abstract

An extended object composed of discrete particles, or a portion of a continuum, will describe a worldtube enclosing the worldlines of its constituent particles.

I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.

—Albert Einstein.

## 6.1 Introduction

Consider a particle of position   in Minkowski spacetime. Instead of describing its motion using time   as   in Newtonian mechanics, we use a 4-dimensional scalar parameter   and the spacetime coordinates (including time) are functions of this parameter,  . This description is more suitable for a 4-dimensional world view. An extended object composed of discrete particles, or a portion of a continuum, will describe a worldtube enclosing the worldlines of its constituent particles.

The requirement that the 3-speed   of a particle be less than the speed of light   has the geometrical meaning that the tangent to the worldline cannot make an angle larger than   (in units in which  ) with the vertical. At all times, the tangent

(6.1)

must not point outside of the light cone at that point (Fig. 5.​3). If the particle is massless and moves at the speed of light, the tangent   will lie along the local light cone while, if the particle is massive,   will point inside the light cone. Recall that

  * A timelike curve is one whose tangent   is always timelike,   everywhere. The worldlines of massive particles are timelike and they are always contained inside the light cone.

  * A lightlike (or null) curve has tangent   that is everywhere null,   (these curves are tangent to the local light cone). The worldlines of massless particles (e.g., photons) are null.

  * A spacelike curve has   everywhere. A curve that has   even at a single point cannot represent a physical particle.

Timelike/lightlike curves are future- [past-] oriented if their tangent   is future- [past-] oriented.

For timelike observers, the notions of "before" and "after" are universal: not so for spacelike observers, for which the notion of cause and effect cannot be defined because what is cause and what is effect depend on the reference frame adopted. The division into causal future, causal past, and elsewhere is invariant for inertial timelike observers because   is invariant under Lorentz transformations.

### 6.1.1 Massive Particles

The tangent   to the worldline of a particle, where the proper time   of the particle is chosen as parameter, is called 4-velocity. The components of the 4-velocity can be expressed in terms of the 3-dimensional velocity  ,

(6.2)

using   and

(6.3)

so that

and the 4-velocity has components

(6.4)

Consider a massive particle (or an observer, which we describe as a particle) with 4-velocity  ; the 4-velocity of a timelike particle is normalized to

(6.5)

In fact, consider the inertial reference frame in which the particle is at rest and its 3-dimensional velocity vanishes,   (this rest frame always exists for a timelike 4-velocity). Use as a parameter the proper time   (remember that this is the time measured by a clock carried by the particle in the frame in which the particle is at rest). Clearly, in this frame it is  ,  , and   so, in Cartesian coordinates,  . Since   is a world scalar, it assumes the same value   in any other coordinate system. Alternatively, in any other inertial frame it is  , which implies that  .

The time dilation formula is contained implicitly in the expression of the Minkowski line element. In the rest frame of the particle, it is  . In another inertial frame moving with velocity   with respect to the rest frame of the particle, the line element is

(6.6)

Combining this equation with  , we obtain

(6.7)

or  , the time dilation formula. For events that are at finite separations we have

(6.8)

Example 6.1

Consider the worldline describing the motion of a particle accelerated along the  -axis with the law

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

(6.12)

where   is a positive constant with the dimensions of an acceleration and   is a parameter with the dimensions of a length. The worldline is the hyperbola of equation   in the   plane or, if you prefer,

(6.13)

This worldline is curved, meaning that the particle is accelerated. The proper time along the worldline is given by

(6.14)

hence   coincides1 with the proper time  . The 4-velocity along this worldline is

(6.15)

Of course,   is normalized correctly:

The particle's 3-dimensional velocity is   with

Note that   but   as  . The hyperbola (6.13) is asymptotic to the light cone   as   (the worldline is asymptotically null but never exactly null).

## 6.2 Relativistic Dynamics of Massive Particles

We have already seen that Newtonian mechanics is not invariant under Lorentz transformations and, therefore, it must be corrected. We can now begin this program.

The mass of a particle   is defined as the mass in the frame in which the particle is at rest and the 4-velocity of the particle is

(6.16)

where   is the proper time of the particle and   is its 4-position (  has the dimensions of a velocity).

The 4-acceleration of the particle is defined analogously to Newtonian mechanics, but with the 4-dimensional view:

(6.17)

A property of the 4-acceleration is that it is always orthogonal to the 4-velocity:

(6.18)

To prove Eq. (6.18), differentiate the normalization relation   with respect to proper time:

(6.19)

All inertial observers agree on the fact that a particle is accelerated but they disagree on the value of the components   of the 4-acceleration. We have

(6.20)

where  . In the instantaneous rest frame of the particle it is

(6.21)

therefore,   only if the proper acceleration (the magnitude of the 3-acceleration in the rest frame) is equal to zero. By contrast, the 4-velocity can never vanish (in the rest frame of the particle  , which means that time always goes on and cannot be stopped, so   in this frame).

One can give a physical meaning to the scalar product of two 4-velocities   and  . Since   is a scalar, we can evaluate it in the rest frame of one of the two particles, say of the particle with 4-velocity  . Then in this frame it is   and

(6.22)

(this equation reduces to   if  ), so   is   times the Lorentz factor of the relative velocity of the two particles. One can define a spacelike 4-vector   which, in the rest frame of  , has components   and such that

(6.23)

(6.24)

(6.25)

This formalism is useful, for example, in the analysis of particle scattering or when one must examine a distribution of matter in a reference frame which is in motion with respect to the rest frame of that matter.

Similarly to Newtonian mechanics, we define the 4-momentum of a particle of mass   as

(6.26)

From   it follows immediately that

(6.27)

The components of the particle 4-momentum are

(6.28)

where   is the relativistic energy

(6.29)

and

(6.30)

is the relativistic 3-momentum.2

For low speeds   it is   and

(6.31)

where   is the rest energy of the particle. We also have

(6.32)

which reproduces the Newtonian 3-momentum in the slow-motion approximation. The component   of the 4-momentum is the relativistic energy of the particle: for this reason   is also called the energy-momentum 4-vector. Its zero component can be regarded as a relativistic energy while its spatial part   is a relativistic 3-dimensional momentum.

Since the position 4-vector is  , the 0-component being just time rescaled by  , identifying   with   corresponds to thinking of energy as a quantity associated with 3-momentum in the same way that time is associated with spatial position. So, if the 3-momentum   is canonically conjugated with the position   in classical mechanics, also energy is canonically conjugated with time (if you have studied Hamiltonian mechanics this sounds familiar, doesn't it?).

### 6.2.1 Relativistic Energy

Having defined  , the normalization   now gives the famous relation between relativistic energy and momentum:

(6.33)

(free particle Hamiltonian). In the rest frame of the particle, where  , this equation reduces to

(6.34)

the most famous equation of physics! One may have expected that this renowned formula would require a lengthy and arcane derivation but, once the reality of the 4-world is accepted, this formula drops out without effort. It is natural to introduce   and   and the formula follows immediately from the inescapable normalization  . It's really that simple, once the 4-dimensional world is accepted.

Equation (6.34) expresses the fact that a free particle possesses energy just because it has mass, and that a small mass can free up an enormous amount of energy because the factor   is large in ordinary units (as demonstrated in nuclear reactions and nuclear bombs): this is the equivalence of mass and energy. 1 gram of mass stores an equivalent   joules, or approximately 20 ktons, the energy of the Hiroshima bomb.3

At low speeds   (or  ), Eq. (6.33) becomes

(6.35)

Equation (6.33) is valid in any inertial frame because it is nothing but the covariant normalization of the momentum  .   and   depend on the inertial frame since they are components of   but the relation between energy and momentum does not.  . in all inertial frames, in other words   is a Lorentz invariant or world scalar.

It is customary to express the energy of subatomic particles in electronvolts. Remember that 1 eV is the energy of an electron (with charge   Coulomb) accelerated by the potential difference of 1 V:

(6.36)

and it is standard practice to measure particle masses in electronvolts   using the equivalence between mass and energy (6.34). For example, the mass of the electron is   kg and its rest energy is, using (6.36),

or

(6.37)

In practice, physicists exchange units of mass and energy freely and refer to the mass of the electron as   MeV omitting the factor   (in other words, using units in which  ). Similarly, the proton mass is

The equivalence between mass and energy manifests itself also in the fact that light behaves as if it had weight. A light ray is deflected by a gravitational field, resulting in the phenomenon of gravitational lensing studied in the context of General Relativity [1], or as energy loss when climbing out of a gravitational potential well (gravitational redshift). And electromagnetic radiation gravitates, in fact it is believed that it was the dominant source of gravity in the universe at some early time when the latter was extremely hot and dense [2–6].

Example 6.2

Compare the relations

This parallel suggests that   transforms in the same way as   under Lorentz transformations, i.e.,

this is true because   transforms as a 4-vector, like  .

### 6.2.2 Pair Production and Annihilation

The equivalence between mass and energy is demonstrated dramatically by the annihilation of pairs of matter-antimatter particles, for example electrons and positrons, into  -ray photons, and by the phenomenon of pair creation in which  -ray photons disappear and an electron-positron pair appears. Annihilation and creation of particle-antiparticle pairs occur for any kind of particle admitting a distinct antiparticle, not only for electrons and positrons. Since the work of Dirac in the 1920s we know that to every fundamental particle there corresponds an antiparticle with the same mass, spin, and opposite charge.4 The association of matter with antimatter is a fundamental symmetry of nature. With the electron e  is associated the positron e  and vice-versa; with the neutron n the antineutron  ; with the proton p  the antiproton p , etc. In pair production two  -photons with energies   MeV can materialize into an electron-positron pair e \- e :

The total charge, momentum, angular momentum (and other quantum numbers such as, e.g., the lepton number)5 are conserved.

Pair annihilation occurs when a particle and its antiparticle collide; they then disappear generating two  -photons,

Again the total charge, momentum, angular momentum, and lepton number are conserved. The annihilation of an electron-positron pair produces a characteristic spectral line at   keV. This spactral line has several applications: for example, it is used in medical physics in Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a standard diagnostic technique in which a radioactive chemical that emits positrons is injected in the body. The characteristic annihilation   line is emitted from regions of the body where the chemical has concentrated due to physiological processes. This concentration, visualized in PET scans, allows doctors to measure blood flow in the brain or other tissues following strokes, brain tumours, or brain injuries. Another application is in astrophysics, where the detection of the 511 keV line by  -ray detectors in space allows one to infer the presence of processes at these energies, or the temperature near a compact object such as a black hole.

Another application is positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), in which the lifetime of positrons emitted by a radioactive source depends on the differential density of electrons. PAS is used to study the structure of materials in solid state physics, for example to detect dislocations or gaps in a crystal.

We live in a universe composed almost entirely of matter, with essentially no antimatter. Given that the early universe must have been a very energetic place with constant production and annihilation of matter and antimatter it is surprising that, when it cooled, there was a predominance of matter versus antimatter left over, instead of a simple bath of gamma photons. This matter-antimatter asymmetry is an unsolved puzzle of cosmology and particle physics.

### 6.2.3   Positron Emission Tomography

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used extensively in clinical oncology for the imaging of tumors and metastases and for diagnosing certain brain diseases, as well as in pure medical research (e.g., [7]). A short-lived isotope of a tracer is injected into a living body by binding it to a biologically reactive molecule (typically, glucose, water, or ammonia). This tracer is carried around the body and concentrates in the tissues under study, where the radioisotope decays emitting positrons. When a positron annihilates with an electron, it emits a pair of 511 keV ( ) photons traveling in approximately opposite directions. These photons are detected by scintillators in the PET scanning machine, in which bursts of light arrive to photomultipliers. The near-simultaneous (within less than 10 ns from each other) detection of two   photons moving in approximately opposite directions is a signature event. Within the experimental error, the reconstruction technique identifies the source of the   photons along the line joining the two detection events and at a certain position along this line determined by the arrival time of each photon. In this way, using millions of data points, images of the tissue can be constructed.

The radiotracers employed are typically  C,  F,  N, and a few other radioactive elements; their half-lives are 20, 110, and 10 min, respectively. Because they are so short-lived, these radiotracers must be produced next to the PET scanning facility or reasonably nearby using a cyclotron, and then quickly bound to a biomolecule using standard chemistry but in a "hot lab" equipped for handling radioactive reagents. A significant amount of data processing is necessary. Modern PET technology combines PET scans with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to improve the amount and quality of the information obtained.

## 6.3 The Relativistic Force

Let us consider now the notion of force in Special Relativity. This concept was fundamental in Newtonian mechanics and we need to discuss both the 4-dimensional and the 3-dimensional notions of force in the new special-relativistic mechanics.

### 6.3.1 The Relativistic 4-Force

Definition 6.1

The 4-force acting on a particle of mass   is defined in a way reminiscent of Newton's second law but with a 4-dimensional flavour:

(6.38)

For a particle of constant mass   this definition reduces to

(6.39)

Equation (6.38) is the 4-dimensional analogue of Newton's second law. It is not derived from more fundamental laws: simply, the definitions given are consistent with it. It is covariant, i.e., it takes the same form in all inertial frames, and it reduces to   when the particle is free (conservation of 4-momentum). Moreover, from Eq. (6.18) it follows immediately that

(6.40)

for particles of constant mass  . However, if the mass   of the particle is not constant, the particle 4-momentum is not conserved: to begin with, the 4-force is

and has a component   along the time direction, in addition to the usual purely spatial component  . The projection of the 4-force onto the time direction   is then

(6.41)

In this case   is not constant. By differentiating this normalization relation and accounting for a non-vanishing  , one obtains again

(6.42)

where the last equality follows from the time dilation formula  .

Example 6.3

Compute the 4-force required to accelerate a particle of mass   along the worldline

We have

(6.43)

(6.44)

and

(6.45)

(6.46)

Of course,   is orthogonal to the 4-velocity:

### 6.3.2 The Relativistic 3-Force

Let us write the equation for the 4-force (6.38) using a derivative with respect to the coordinate time   instead of the proper time:

(6.47)

Defining the relativistic 3-dimensional force as

(6.48)

where   is the relativistic 3-momentum, we have

(6.49)

where

(6.50)

and where   is constructed with the 3-dimensional components of the 4-force.   is the power, i.e., the rate at which the force transfers energy to the particle.

Since   for a particle of constant mass, we have

and

(6.51)

where   is the usual 3-dimensional velocity. The time component of the equation of motion   becomes   or  :

(6.52)

which expresses the energy loss of the particle as work done against the 3-dimensional relativistic force  . This equation is a consequence of the other three equations of motion   in the limit  .

Note the parallel between the expression of the 4-force and that of the 4-velocity:

(6.53)

For a particle subject to a constant 3-force (cause) the 3-acceleration (effect) is smaller than the corresponding acceleration in Newtonian mechanics and, at higher and higher speeds, it is harder and harder to accelerate the particle. As a result, it is impossible to accelerate the massive particle to speed  . In fact,

(6.54)

Considering, for simplicity, motion in one dimension, we have

and

(6.55)

As   the 3-acceleration   caused by any finite constant force tends to zero. It is impossible to accelerate a massive particle to speed  . As we have seen in Chap. , the possibility of breaking this barrier would jeopardize causality, but causality turns out to be protected by the impossibility of reaching   for a massive particle. The following calculation shows that this goal would require an infinite amount of work done on the particle.

### 6.3.3 Relativistic Kinetic Energy

The (Newtonian) work done by a relativistic 3-force   parallel to the  -axis is

(6.56)

now, in relativity, we have

(which we have already computed to derive Eq. (6.55)), so that

Formally,   and

assuming that the particle is initially at rest. Then we have

and finally

(6.57)

We have thus established the work-energy theorem

(6.58)

where

(6.59)

is the relativistic kinetic energy (the relativistic energy of a free particle   minus its rest energy  ). The work done on a particle is equal to the variation of its kinetic energy.

Equations (6.58) and (6.59) are confirmed every day in accelerators. In the limit   the quantity   reduces to the Newtonian kinetic energy,

(6.60)

The speed   as a function of the kinetic energy   of a free particle is

(6.61)

and it is easy to see that   as  . The function   of the ratio   is plotted in Fig. 6.1, where it is compared with its Newtonian counterpart  .

Fig. 6.1

The speed of a relativistic free particle   as a function of the rescaled kinetic energy   (solid curve), compared with its Newtonian counterpart (dotted curve)

The total energy of the free particle is

(6.62)

This formula is, of course, consistent with the relation (6.33) between energy and momentum. In fact, remember that

and, therefore,

A particle with energy much larger than its rest energy,  , is said to be ultrarelativistic.

### 6.3.4 Motion with Constant Acceleration

In Newton's theory a constant acceleration of a massive particle with velocity   is defined by  const. , which implies that   as   if  . This is not possible in Special Relativity where  . One needs a different definition of "constant acceleration".

Definition 6.2

The acceleration of a particle is constant if and only if it has the same value at each instant in any inertial frame instantaneously comoving with the particle (this frame keeps changing at every instant of time).6

At different  -times there are different inertial frames which are instantaneously comoving with the particle, but they all measure the same acceleration  . The definition can be stated by saying that the proper acceleration of the particle is constant.

If   is the velocity of the particle in a frame  , in any comoving frame (i.e., in any frame moving at speed  ), the velocity of the particle is   and   const.  . Then, remembering the transformation law of accelerations (2.​38)–(2.​40) we have, setting   and  ,

(6.63)

Integrate the equation

between   and   and use the fact that

to obtain

and

Assume the initial condition  , then

This is a transcendental equation for   which can be solved exactly and yields

Isolating   one obtains

and finally

Integrating again, we find

Setting   we have

Re-arranging the terms, it is

and

(6.64)

Adopting initial conditions   and   for simplicity, Eq. (6.64) reduces to

(6.65)

which is represented geometrically by a family of hyperbolae parametrized by   in the   plane (for this reason the uniformly accelerated motion is often called hyperbolic motion). These hyperbolae are the loci of points at constant spacetime distance from the origin and can be written as

(6.66)

A parametrization of the hyperbolae is

(6.67)

(6.68)

with   and   constant. It is easy to see, by substituting Eqs. (6.67) and (6.68), that Eq. (6.65) is satisfied. Each hyperbola is the worldline of a uniformly accelerated observer travelling in the  -direction. This observer   has an event horizon: light can only travel along   lines in a spacetime diagram and there is a region such that, if you send signals from it, they will never reach the observer (Fig. 6.2).

An event horizon is a barrier beyond which no information can be transmitted, or a causal barrier. In this respect, the acceleration horizon is similar to a black hole horizon, a surface which lets objects and radiation go through only in one direction. The horizon caused by uniform acceleration is referred to as a Rindler or acceleration horizon and is a null surface. Uniformly accelerated observers are important in quantum field theory; a uniformly accelerated observer in Minkowski spacetime will detect a thermal bath of particles of a quantum field at temperature  , where   is the reduced Planck constant and   is the Boltzmann constant (Unruh temperature), while a stationary inertial observer detects zero quanta of the field (Unruh effect) [8–10]. An accelerated observer moving along a constant acceleration path is called a Rindler observer. The Minkowski spacetime can be threaded by the worldlines of Rindler observers and their acceleration horizons are relative to these observers.

Fig. 6.2

Signals sent from the region   (shaded) will never reach the uniformly accelerated observer with worldline described by the hyperbola. In order to do so these signals would have to travel faster than light and exit from the local light cone, with worldline tangent making an angle smaller than   with the horizontal

### 6.3.5   Particle Accelerators

For a given energy  , the Lorentz factor of a particle is  , which means that light particles such as electrons and positrons can be made much more relativistic than heavier particles such as protons or nuclei, i.e., they can get closer to the speed of light or, equivalently, achieve larger  -factors (the two statements are equivalent since  ). When a particle is accelerated to speeds near the speed of light, further acceleration increases its kinetic energy   and its momentum   and, as a consequence, the greater the initial velocity the harder it is to accelerate this particle further. It is useful to look at some numbers to get a feel for this aspect of relativistic dynamics.

An electron is easily accelerated; if it has energy   its speed is

in the laboratory frame. An 1 MeV electron has speed  . Accelerating it further to an energy of 10 MeV gives it the speed  . Further acceleration to an energy of 50 MeV gives it the speed   and the energy of 1 GeV further brings it to  . Therefore, electrons of vastly different energies (10 MeV or 1 GeV) do not differ much in speed.

Particle accelerators provide beams of high-energy charged particles which are scattered against fixed targets or other particles to study interations in particle physics. In the early 1900s Rutherford used natural radioactive samples as sources of  -particles (helium nuclei, consisting of two protons and two neutrons) to probe the structure of the atom and later on cosmic rays were employed.7 Over the years is turned out to be more practical to build accelerators as artificial sources of high-energy particles to use in scattering experiments. The first particle accelerators used static electric fields and, later, alternating electric fields were used, both in linear accelerator configurations (LINACs) and in cyclotrons. For heavier particles, linear drift tubes are limited by their size while, in a cyclotron, a particle beam can be circulated many times and accelerated repeteadly in a much smaller structure, achieving the same energy that would require a larger linear accelerator. In a cyclotron a strong magnetic field keeps charged particles on a circular orbit. The particle beam circulates inside two D-shaped cavities with a gap in between. An alternating electric field in the gap is responsible for accelerating the charged particles and must be kept synchronized with the particles because of the special-relativistic relation   replacing the Newtonian one   (hence the name "synchrotron").

While circular synchrotrons are very convenient for heavier particles, they have a very serious limitation for electrons and positrons. Accelerated charges emit electromagnetic radiation (synchrotron radiation). This effect is minimal for linear trajectories but is maximized for circular orbits. The energy lost to synchrotron radiation during each turn scales as  , where   is the radius of the orbit and it is easy to see how very relativistic particles such as electrons and positrons will lose a much larger fraction of their energy than heavier particles like protons, antiprotons, or nuclei. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [11] at CERN in Geneva accelerates protons or lead ions to energies of 14 TeV. The energy lost by synchrotron emission by these particles is a negligible fraction of their total energy (although it must be resupplied). However, if the beams were composed of electrons or positrons with comparable energy, their energy loss would be much larger and the energy of the particle beams would be hopelessly depleted for the purpose of colliding high-energy particles and probe smaller and smaller spatial scales. Essentially, one would waste all the particle energy into synchrotron radiation. Acceleration rings for electrons or positrons become impractical for fundamental physics experiments at energies above   and linear accelerators become useful again for these light particles because of the much smaller loss by syncrotron radiation in a linear trajectory. A possible future facility under design and intended to replace the LHC when it will go out of commission is a linear accelerator. The International Linear Collider (ILC) aims to accelerate beams of electrons at 0.5–1 TeV energies [12]. Circular rings are much more practical for accelerating heavy particles and are still useful for technical applications and synchrotron light imaging by accelerating electrons at moderate energies.

## 6.4 Angular Momentum of a Particle

For a Newtonian particle of position   with respect to a given origin and of momentum  , the angular momentum is   and the torque of a force   is  . We know that   and therefore, if the torque   vanishes, the angular momentum   is conserved. Let us see what the analogues of these Newtonian properties are in Special Relativity.

The definition of angular momentum carries over to Special Relativity, provided that   represents the relativistic 3-momentum.

Definition 6.3

For a particle of 4-momentum   at position  , the angular momentum (pseudo-)tensor is defined as

(6.69)

This object is a pseudo-tensor because   can be written as

(6.70)

where   is the Levi-Civita symbol defined by Eq. (4.​88).   is obviously antisymmetric,  .

The theorem of conservation of angular momentum states that the angular momentum of a particle which is not subject to forces is conserved,

(6.71)

where   is the proper time of the particle parametrizing its worldline. In fact, by differentiating Eq. (6.70) with respect to  , one obtains

The first term of the last line vanishes because the Levi-Civita symbol is antisymmetric in the indices   and   while the product   is instead symmetric. In the absence of forces,  , or when the "torque"   vanishes, it is   and,

## 6.5 Particle Systems

Here we define briefly the momentum and angular momentum of discrete systems of point particles. Continuous systems such as elastic media and fluids will be discussed later in Chap. . The theory of point particle systems becomes a bit more specialized when applied to scattering processes and when discussing the conservation of angular momentum: here we omit the relevant discussion and refer the reader to more advanced textbooks (e.g., [5, 13]). It should be kept in mind that, in a discrete point-particle system, the inter-particle separation cannot be constant: rigid bodies correspond to infinite sound speed and are forbidden in Special Relativity.

For a system of   particles of masses   and 4-momenta  , one defines the total mass

(6.72)

(where the subscript   denotes the particle, not a tensor component), the total momentum

(6.73)

and,8 fixed an origin, the total angular momentum is

(6.74)

The law of conservation of momentum in Special Relativity is not derived but it is postulated because of its consistency with experiment, much as Newton's second law in classical mechanics. This law says that, for a system of particles in which there are no external forces and subject only to interactions (for example, collisions) between its particles,

(6.75)

Since  , we have the law of conservation of mass-energy

and the 3-momentum conservation

(6.76)

One cannot have one law without the other because both energy and relativistic 3-momentum are part of the same 4-vector.

In the following section we discuss the conservation of mass-energy. Dynamical considerations on a system of point particles are less obvious than in Newtonian mechanics. For example, consider the concept of centre of mass, taking a system of two identical particles of equal mass and opposite velocities approaching each other. In Newtonian mechanics the centre of mass is halfway between the two particles. In Special Relativity an observer at rest with respect to one of the two identical particles will see the other particle (which has equal rest mass) approaching with the entire kinetic energy of the system. For this reason, the second particle is heavier than the first and the centre of mass will be closer to the second particle than to the first one at rest in this frame. Different inertial frames will assign different velocities and different kinetic energies to the two particles and the location of the centre of mass will differ in these frames. However, one can still define a 3-velocity

(6.77)

where

(6.78)

  is the relativistic 3-momentum of each particle, and   is the total mass (6.72). In the inertial frame   (centre of momentum frame) moving with velocity   with respect to the original inertial frame   in which Eqs. (6.72) and (6.73) are defined, the total momentum (6.73) has no spatial components.

## 6.6 Conservation of Mass-Energy

For a particle at rest it is  . Since in ordinary units   is a very large number, a small amount of mass is equivalent to a very large energy. Dramatic verifications of this formula in nuclear physics include nuclear reactions, nuclear bombs, and nuclear power plants. In particle physics they include creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In these situations mass is converted into energy and energy into mass. Since mass can be converted into energy and vice-versa, conservation of mass and conservation of energy do not hold separately and one has conservation of mass-energy instead:

the total mass-energy of a system of particles is conserved.

Consider an isolated system of particles that are allowed to interact with each other (e.g., through scattering processes); the mass-energy of particle   is

(6.79)

and the total mass-energy   is constant.

For example, consider the totally inelastic collision of two particles with equal masses  , antiparallel velocities  , which come together and form a single particle of mass  . The total mass-energy before the collision is equal to the total mass-energy after it, i.e.,

(6.80)

(because of the conservation of momentum the resulting particle is at rest with no kinetic energy). Then the mass   of the product particle is

(6.81)

and is larger than the sum of the masses of the colliding particles,  . The mass defect

(6.82)

is defined so that  . We have

(6.83)

(6.84)

which proves Eq. (6.82). We deduce that kinetic energy has been converted into mass.

In order to break down an atomic nucleus into its components, one must supply an amount of energy called binding energy ( ). The mass-energy of a bound system is

(6.85)

Note that the bound system is not a system of free particles: the binding energy is a potential energy of interaction between the particles. Since

the bound system is a configuration with less energy than the ensemble of free particles, hence it is energetically favoured and stable.

### 6.6.1 Nuclear Fusion

Atomic nuclei can fuse with each other and liberate energy. Nuclear fusion occurs spontaneously in the core of stars and also, in an uncontrolled way, in man-made hydrogen bombs. The search for controlled nuclear fusion holds the promise of clean nuclear power generation and remains the holy grail of research on power generation. In nuclear physics the strong force is much stronger than the electrical force and huge amounts of energy per particle mass are involved.

Read Eq. (6.85) from right to left, i.e., collide electrically charged nuclei (or other particles) with masses   until their Coulomb repulsion is overcome. Then the final particle has energy   and the energy   is liberated.

The proton-proton chain reaction (pp-chain) is a nuclear fusion process providing the main source of pressure in main sequence stars (stars like our sun), in which hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium [14]. The first two steps of the pp-chain are

and from here the process can proceed with three possible reactions. In our sun the most important one is

The net reaction liberates   of energy in the form of photons and neutrinos (of which   MeV are carried away by neutrinos). Other cycles important for the evolution of stars more massive than the sun are the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) and the triple-  cycles [14].

Nuclear masses can be measured very accurately using mass spectrometers and the conservation of mass-energy has been tested accurately.

### 6.6.2 Nuclear Fission

Consider an atomic nucleus of mass   at rest that decays into three particles with masses  , and   and speeds  , and  , respectively. This process is called nuclear fission. The conservation of mass-energy yields

(6.86)

Clearly, it is

because all square roots in the denominators on the right hand side of Eq. (6.86) are less than unity. The mass loss is

which goes into the kinetic energy of the three particles. The disintegration energy released per fission reaction is

(6.87)

These considerations are important for atomic nuclei or for composite particles: when nucleons (protons and neutrons) bind together to form a nucleus the mass of the latter is less than the sum of the masses of the components. This means that the bound state is energetically favoured over a state corresponding to the isolated nucleons and a nucleus will form. Conversely, if sufficient energy is given the situation can be reversed and the bound state can decay into free nucleons, liberating an amount of energy   through fission. Fission processes were used in the first nuclear bombs and are used in nuclear reactors for power generation.

## 6.7 Conclusion

The basic notions of the kinematics and dynamics of massive particles are now known. As promised, the 4-dimensional world view unveils a deep relation between the energy and the momentum of a particle and the equivalence between mass and energy. Unfortunately, due to the vagaries of history, Einstein's famous formula   was applied to nuclear weapons before finding peaceful uses. Because of this early application, technology derived directly from fundamental physics has modified society profoundly during a large part of the twentieth century, a situation which seems now irreversible. The conversion of mass into energy explains the source of energy fuelling stars, which was a major puzzle before the development of nuclear physics. Leaving aside these most spectacular aspects of Special Relativity, a new view has emerged with the study of massive particles. We still have to see how massless particles behave in this theory, which provides more surprises.

## 6.8 Problems

6.1.

Abstract

After studying the mechanics of massive test particles, it is now time to discuss massless particles. There are differences in the mechanics of massless and massive particles, as is evident from the fact that the Lorentz transformation, the formulae for time dilation and length contraction, and the concept of proper quantities, do not make sense in the limit in which the speed of an inertial observer goes to c—divergences occur. Moreover, there is no rest frame for massless particles. However, similarities remain in certain other formulae. Some of the effects presented here have applications in many areas of physics, astrophysics, and technology. Here we discuss geometric optics, the high-frequency limit of wave optics. Wave optics is discussed in Chap. 9.

The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.

## 7.1 Introduction

After studying the mechanics of massive test particles, it is now time to discuss massless particles. There are differences in the mechanics of massless and massive particles, as is evident from the fact that the Lorentz transformation, the formulae for time dilation and length contraction, and the concept of proper quantities, do not make sense in the limit in which the speed of an inertial observer goes to  —divergences occur. Moreover, there is no rest frame for massless particles. However, similarities remain in certain other formulae. Some of the effects presented here have applications in many areas of physics, astrophysics, and technology. Here we discuss geometric optics, the high-frequency limit of wave optics. Wave optics is discussed in Chap. .

## 7.2 Relativistic Optics: Null Rays

Massless particles (photons and gravitons) travel at the speed of light. In any inertial frame they satisfy the relation

(7.1)

and

By introducing a parameter   with the dimensions of a length along the null curve,1

(7.2)

where   is the 4-tangent to the particle worldline (which is also called a null ray). Therefore, for massless particles   is dimensionless and its normalization is

(7.3)

Do not be startled by the use of a parameter other than a time: for example, the worldline   of a photon moving in the direction of the positive  -axis has equation   and can be described parametrically by

(7.4)

where   is the parameter and  .   is a null vector and, in addition, satisfies the equation

(7.5)

It is always possible to rotate the spatial axes so that the  -axis is aligned with the direction of the ray and   assumes the form   in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, Eq. (7.5) applies to all null rays in Cartesian coordinates. Since a null vector can always be reduced to the form   and the constant   is unimportant, the case   is general.

The meaning of Eq. (7.5) is that light rays are not accelerated and follow straight lines in Minkowski spacetime; in fact, by integrating this equation one obtains the linear solution  , where   and   are constants determined by the initial position and tangent of the null ray; this is the parametric representation of a straight line. Equations (7.3) and (7.5) can be expressed by saying that the massless particle does not accelerate (in Chap.  we will express this fact by saying that the massless particle follows an affinely-parametrized null geodesic curve of Minkowski spacetime). Other parametrizations are possible for the null ray, for example one could use   instead of  . Then (forgetting about the odd dimensions of the new parameter  ) its 4-tangent would be

and   would still be a null vector   but

A parameter   such that

is called an affine parameter. The equation of motion of an affinely-parametrized null ray takes the same form as that for a massive particle with proper time as the parameter.

Let   ( ), then the normalization (7.3) implies that   and

(7.6)

  is a necessary condition for   to be null and non-trivial and it must be   for the 4-tangent   to be future-pointing.

In the geometric optics approximation, which is the limit of Maxwell's wave optics when the wavelength of electromagnetic waves tends to zero, waves will propagate along null rays (which are normal to the wavefronts). These are often called photon trajectories although the terminology is not justified here since we are in a purely classical context while the photon is a quantum concept.

Let   be a parameter along the null ray in 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in vacuo; this ray is a straight line. Let   be the 4-vector tangent to the ray and define the wave 4-vector

(7.7)

where   is the angular frequency,  , and  . The dimensions of these quantities are   and   (note that   is a necessary condition for   to be a null vector). Define the 3-dimensional "velocity" of the ray as

(7.8)

Then   is equivalent to

or

and

The equation

(7.9)

expresses the fact that the ray propagates in 3-dimensional space at the speed of light, so

(7.10)

In quantum mechanics the energy of a photon of angular frequency   is

(7.11)

where   is the reduced Planck constant, and the photon momentum is

(7.12)

This relation leads one to define the photon 4-momentum

(7.13)

The normalization   (or  ) can then be written as

or

(7.14)

i.e., as the limit for the rest mass   of the familiar Eq. (6.​34) valid for massive particles. The relation (7.14) is well known to be satisfied by classical electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory.

To summarize, in Special Relativity there exists a privileged class of observers (inertial observers) and the worldlines of these observers are privileged classes of curves in Minkowski spacetime such that:

  * Ideal clocks travel along these timelike curves and measure the parameter   (proper time) defined by  .

  * Massive particles travel along timelike curves parametrized by proper time   with 4-tangent   normalized to  .

  * Massless particles travel along null curves (light rays) with 4-tangents   such that   and the wave 4-vector   satisfies  .

## 7.3 The Drag Effect

Consider a flowing transparent liquid and light propagating through it: experiments performed by Fizeau in 1851, Michelson and Morley in 1886, and Zeeman in 1914 [1–3] indicate that the medium drags the light along with it. If the speed of light in the liquid medium at rest is   and the liquid moves with speed  , the speed of light relative to an inertial frame outside the liquid is experimentally found to be

(7.15)

where   is the refraction index of the medium and   is known as the Fresnel drag coefficient. An explanation of this phenomenon based on the ether was given by Fresnel long before Einstein, but we now know that it cannot be correct. Instead, apply the (inverse) relativistic law of composition of velocities (2.​31)–(2.​33). The light travels with speed   relative to the medium and the medium travels with speed   relative to an inertial frame   outside the liquid, hence

To lowest order, the drag effect is reproduced simply as the relativistic law of addition of velocities. This simple explanation was given by Laub and von Laue in 1907 [4, 5].

## 7.4 The Doppler Effect

The non-relativistic Doppler effect for sound waves can distinguish between motion of the source and motion of the observer. The angular frequency   emitted by a source moving with velocity   is perceived by an observer moving with velocity   as

(7.16)

where the upper signs apply to motions of the source and observer toward each other, the lower signs to motions away from each other, and   is the speed of sound. Therefore, one can distinguish the absolute motion of frames with respect to the medium in which the longitudinal sound waves propagate (for example air). This distinction is possible because longitudinal sound waves require a medium to propagate: they cannot propagate in empty space and the medium provides an "absolute" frame of reference with respect to which motions are referred.

Fig. 7.1

A monochromatic source of light at rest in   emits light at the angular frequency   toward an observer, who receives it at the angular frequency

In the relativistic Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves in vacuo, instead, one cannot distinguish the motion of the source from the motion of the observer, according to the Principle of Relativity.2 This situation is due to the fact that there is no medium (ether) and electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuo.

Consider, as in Fig. 7.1, a source of electromagnetic waves emitting at a single angular frequency   (the angular frequency in the rest frame of the source) and an observer who sees the source moving with velocity   and receives the angular frequency  . Let   be the arrival angle of the light (the angle between the direction of propagation of the waves and the negative direction of the source ( ) motion in the observer's frame  ), let  , then  . The variation in the angular frequency is obtained by writing the transformation law for the time component of the 4-vector

(7.17)

or (the primed frame is the frame moving with the source)

(7.18)

Since  , using

in the last equality, it is

and

(7.19)

(relativistic Doppler effect formula). Some special cases are worth considering. For   we have the radial Doppler effect with  . To first order in  , it is

and

(7.20)

For   we have the transverse Doppler effect with

which is of order O . The transverse Doppler effect is purely relativistic and is due only to time dilation. It is usually covered by a first order longitudinal component and is, therefore, difficult to detect. Experiments performed using a rapidly rotating disk with a source at the centre and detectors at the rim, and using  -rays and Mössbauer technology were able to detect this second order effect in the early 1960s [8, 9]. The formula of the pre-relativistic Doppler effect is

(7.21)

but in Special Relativity one has to take into account also the dilation for the period   of the wave, which yields

(7.22)

(where   is the period in the rest frame of the source), or  . Taking into account both effects one obtains Eq. (7.19). In the non-relativistic limit   one recovers the pre-relativistic formula (7.21). Qualitatively we have that

(remember the convention that   for motion of the source and the observer away from each other). In spectroscopy, the redshift factor is defined as

(7.23)

since   we have also

(7.24)

In our case it is

We have

  *   for   (source and observer are moving away from each other) and we have redshift: .

  *   for   (source and observer move toward each other) and we have blueshift: .

## 7.5 Aberration

The term aberration denotes the fact that the angle at which a moving object is seen depends on the relative velocity of the observer. A well known example of non-relativistic aberration occurs when the angle of falling rain depends on the velocity of the observer who is getting wet. If rain is falling vertically (in the absence of wind) for an inertial observer, a second observer moving with respect to the first one with constant velocity   will see the rain falling obliquely.

Fig. 7.2

A light signal arrives at the inertial observer in  , its negative direction of arrival making an angle   with the  -axis

The phenomenon of relativistic aberration consists of the dependence of the direction of propagation of radiation from the relative velocity of two inertial frames. Consider an incoming light signal whose negative direction makes an angle   with the observer in an inertial frame S and an angle   with a different observer in another inertial frame   moving with speed   with respect to   in standard configuration. Assume that the light propagates in the   plane (Fig. 7.2). Apply the velocity transformation formula

to the light signal3 itself ( ). In this case,

and, from the transformation property (2.​31) of  , we obtain

and

(7.25)

We can also use the transformation property (2.​32) of   and

to obtain   and

(7.26)

(Alternatively, one can use Eq. (7.25) and   to obtain Eq. (7.26)). Equations (7.25) and (7.26) are known as aberration formulae. By using Eqs. (7.25) and (7.26) and a trigonometric identity one obtains

hence

(7.27)

For rays propagating outward at angles   and   one replaces   with  .

Due to aberration, as the earth travels along its orbit, the apparent directions of the fixed stars trace small ellipses during the year (their major axes span approximately 40 arcseconds), an effect sufficiently large to have been discovered in the first half of the 18th century. Contrary to parallax, stellar aberration is independent of the star's distance.

The inverse laws of aberration can be obtained by invoking the Principle of Relativity and with the (now familiar) exchange of primed and unprimed quantities and  ,

(7.28)

(7.29)

(7.30)

If, at this point, you think that relativistic aberration makes sense intuitively, think again. Relativistic aberration is counterintuitive: consider, for example, an object subtending a small angle   in the frame   (and, correspondingly, a small angle   in  ). According to our low speed intuition when we approach an object its angular size increases and, when we recede from it, its angular size decreases. In Special Relativity the inverse law of aberration (7.29) gives, for small angles,

and, expanding for small values of   and assuming that the object of angular size   is approached (i.e.,  ), we obtain

(7.31)

Approaching the object at first reduces its angular size and, therefore, it appears to recede. As the object gets closer and closer the angles   and   are no longer small, eventually passing through  , and the approximate formula (7.31) becomes invalid. When this happens, approaching an object increases the appearance of its angular size.

## 7.6 Relativistic Beaming

Consider a spherical surface emitting electromagnetic radiation isotropically in all directions in its rest frame. This isotropy will be broken when seen by an inertial observer   moving with respect to the rest frame of the source, which is not surprising since the velocity of this observer introduces a preferred direction. The radiation will be concentrated along the direction of motion due to the transformation property of the photons' spatial momenta: this effect is called relativistic beaming.

Fig. 7.3

Relativistic beaming

Consider a photon propagating at an angle   with the  '-axis in the rest frame   of the source (Fig. 7.3).The aberration formula (7.25) calculated in the previous section gives

(7.32)

(relativistic beaming formula). In general,   implies that   or, the forward radiation emitted in a cone is beamed in a narrower cone as seen by the observer   who sees the source moving. Consider the rays emitted in the forward hemisphere   in the rest frame of the source. For the observer   these rays are concentrated in the cone defined by  , where

and

(7.33)

As  , this cone will have a very small aperture.

A uniformly radiating extended source appears brighter if it is moving toward us than if it is moving in the opposite direction (headlight or searchlight effect). The intensity of the radiation, defined as the energy emitted per unit time, per unit of normal area, and per unit of solid angle,

is higher in the forward direction than in the backward direction because:

  * there is a change in the angular size of the emitting region. Rays are beamed in the forward direction and more rays fall on the unit of normal area than if the source were at rest.

  * The Doppler shift increases the frequency and energy of the photons in the forward direction and decreases it in the backward direction (remember that the energy   of a photon is proportional to its frequency   according to  ).

  * There is an increase in the number of photons crossing the unit of normal area in the unit of time due to the combined motion of the observer toward the source and to time dilation.

Relativistic beaming is observed in the jets originating in active galactic nuclei and is usefully employed in synchrotron light imaging.

### 7.6.1   Synchrotron Light Imaging

As an example of applications of Special Relativity and of relativistic beaming in particular, we mention synchrotron light sources and their multiple uses in science and technology. One of the fundamental facts of electromagnetism is that accelerated charges emit electromagnetic radiation ("synchrotron radiation") and this property is particularly evident in both linear and circular particle accelerators. Beginning with the small accelerators of the post-World War II era, circular accelerators have grown to the giant size of accelerators used today for particle physics discoveries, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. Light particles which can easily achieve large Lorentz factors, such as electrons and positrons, are subject to dramatic energy losses by synchrotron radiation in circular accelerators, which limits the usefulness of these devices for fundamental physics discoveries with electrons and positrons. However, if reaching very high electron energy is not the goal, the high Lorentz factors that can be achieved by man-made beams of light particles can still be put to good use. Relativistic electrons can easily be given large  -factors and synchrotron radiation is focused in a narrow cone due to relativistic beaming. This cone can be made quite narrow: remember that its aperture   as seen by an observer in the laboratory satisfies the relation   (cf. Eq. (7.26)). Electrons with an energy of a few GeV have Lorentz factors , which gives   rad when   rad. Since there are advantages in having such a bright, concentrated beam of radiation for the imaging of small structures, relativistic beaming of synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated electrons of moderate energy allows for the construction of dedicated facilities in which beams of synchrotron radiation at various wavelengths (infrared, ultraviolet, and X-ray, collectively called "synchrotron light") are available. Different applications require different wavelengths: in order to probe a certain structure one must use radiation with a wavelength comparable to the size of that structure, for example a bacterium of size   m is probed by visible light, a protein (size   m) by ultraviolet or soft X-rays, small molecules (size  –  m) by hard X-rays. Synchrotron radiation imaging has been applied to fundamental studies in biology, medicine, material science and condensed matter physics, and has many technological and industrial applications. Discoveries made with synchrotron light include the structure of certain DNA proteins, of neurotoxins, the 3-dimensional imaging of ancient insects encased in pre-historic amber, and the study of viruses.4 Industrial applications include new drug design in the pharmaceutical industry, various X-ray fluorescence techniques to study trace contaminants in otherwise highly pure samples (for example silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry, in which impurities whch alter their electronic properties must be kept strictly under control), and catalysts in chemical reactions for various purposes. The analysis of samples with synchrotron radiation is usually non-destructive and involves less or no preparation in comparison with more traditional techniques of analysis. Many synchrotron light facilities have been built around the world and new, higher frequency X-ray synchrotron sources are currently being designed.5

## 7.7 Visual Appearance of Extended Objects

When an extended object is passing by at relativistic speed, its appearance may be quite different from what it would look like at rest. The image may appear rotated, sheared, curved, and distorted. Consider, for example, a snapshot taken by a camera of an extended object passing by. Light rays reaching the plane of the camera at the same instant of time have started from different points of the object, which are further away from the camera, at different (earlier) times. Because the object is moving, its different points sending light rays to the camera were occupying different positions at the same time. As a result, the rays reaching the camera portray the points of the object when these point sources were at different positions. (In fact, as we know from the study of high school geometric optics, an observer perceives these points as being either on the rays reaching the camera or on their extensions.) A striking effect is that an object appears rotated with respect to its rest frame (Terrell rotation). These effects become noticeable when the object moves a significant distance during times comparable to the difference in travel times between its various points and the camera. Clearly, this effect occurs when the velocity of the object becomes relativistic and is due to the finiteness of the speed of light. In addition there are Lorentz contraction, aberration, and beaming. The color and luminosity of the object are also affected.

Fig. 7.4

A rod moving with constant acceleration   in the  -direction in the inertial frame

Let us consider two (over-)simplified examples to obtain a qualitative idea of the simplest effects at play. As the first example consider a thin rod which, in an inertial frame  , remains parallel to the  -axis while it moves with constant acceleration   in the   direction (Fig. 7.4) obeying the law6

(7.34)

For simplicity we assume that the rod has zero thickness: this assumption is, of course, unrealistic but corresponds to an observer not being able to distinguish details from a distance, which greatly simplifies the problem. In another inertial frame   related to   by a Lorentz transformation (2.​1)–(2.​4) with velocity  , the equation of motion of the rod is

(7.35)

At a constant time   the rod has the shape of a segment of a parabola. For example at   it is   (see Fig. 7.5, drawn for the parameter values   and  , in units in which  ). As time goes on, the shape of the rod seen in   changes because two coefficients in the equation of the parabola (7.35) are time-dependent.

Fig. 7.5

The accelerating rod seen in the inertial frame   at

As a second example consider a rod of negligible thickness which, in its rest frame  , lies in the   plane, makes and angle   with the  -axis, and has proper length  . The rod and its rest frame move with velocity   in standard configuration with respect to another inertial frame  . In this frame, the rod makes an angle   with the  -axis and has length  . Its  component is Lorentz-contracted,   while the  -component is not affected,  . As a result the length of the rod as measured in   is

The angle   which the rod makes with the  -axis is given by

so the rod appears rotated with respect to its rest frame.

The description of the rods in the previous two examples is intentionally oversimplified by neglecting one of their dimensions. If all three dimensions of an object are taken into account and a camera takes instantaneous pictures in sharp focus of this object going by at constant speed  , the object will not just appear Lorentz-contracted: its image will be sheared, rotated, and acquire curvature even if it is has a straight contour, such as a cube. The process of imaging an extended object with light rays starting from different points of the object at different times is rather complex and very detailed and will not be discussed here. It began being studied only five decades after the introduction of Special Relativity and has been the subject of many articles, gaining more popularity as the power of modern computers progressively allowed better and better simulations of objects moving at relativistic speeds [19–37]. Recently, computer simulations of relativistic optics have achieved a high level of sophistication which allows one to build intuition in Special Relativity [38–41].7

## 7.8 Conclusion

The 4-dimensional world view has uncovered another deep relation between the frequency (or energy) and the wave vector (or momentum) of massless particles. Moreover, the appearance of objects (including their shape, apparent orientation, angular size, color, and luminosity) turns out to be quite different in different inertial frames moving at high speeds relative to each other. Shape, orientation, angular size, and color are relative to the state of motion of the observer, another good reason to name the theory "Relativity".

## 7.9 Problems

7.1

Derive the inverse laws of aberration (7.28)–(7.30) without invoking the Principle of Relativity as done in the text.

7.2

Is there a particular angle of view at which the Doppler shift vanishes exactly? If so, compute it

(a) for small values of  ;

(b) for observer and source approaching each other at speed  .

7.3

Aberration occurs in pre-relativistic physics. On a windless day, rain falls vertically on an inertial observer  . Consider a raindrop which, in the frame   of   falls vertically in the   plane according to

with  , and   positive constants (the droplet has reached terminal velocity and is in uniform rectilinear motion in this frame). At what angle   with the horizontal will another inertial observer   (moving in standard configuration with velocity   with respect to  ) see the rain coming or, what is the trajectory of a raindrop in the   frame of  ? Discuss the situations  , and the limit  . Can   see horizontal rain (an English expression used in foul weather)?

7.4

Discuss the relativistic version of the previous exercise: compute the angle   which the incoming rain makes with the horizontal as seen by the moving inertial observer   and compare it with the non-relativistic case. At what speed   between the two inertial frames is the angle   equal to  ? What happens in the limit  ? Derive your answer

(a) using the Lorentz transformation;

(b) using the law of transformation of velocities.

(c) Compare the two results.

7.5

In the   inertial frame a rod of zero thickness lies in the   plane, is parallel to the  -axis, and covers the segment  . The rod moves in this plane, always remaining parallel to the  -axis, in the direction of the positive  -axis with constant velocity  . Describe the appearance and the motion of the rod in the   inertial frame with respect to which   is moving with constant velocity   in standard configuration. Is your result consistent with the relativistic transformation of velocities?

Abstract

In Special Relativity an observer is characterized by a timelike 4-velocity  .

Truth is what stands the test of experience.

—Albert Einstein.

## 8.1 Introduction

In Special Relativity an observer is characterized by a timelike 4-velocity  . Quantities such as lengths, time intervals, and special-relativistic energies are not Lorentz-invariant and different observers (even different inertial observers) will measure different values for these quantities—it seems as if they will measure components of vectors or tensors in their own rest frame. From both the physical and mathematical points of view this is not satisfactory because we want the physical observables to be quantities defined in a coordinate-independent way, not coordinate components (after all, a given observer can change coordinates without making Lorentz boosts). This need motivates the present chapter. The strategy to solve this problem consists of characterizing the observer by means of its 4-velocity   and of projecting vectors and tensors onto this 4-vector, thereby obtaining covariant quantities.

## 8.2 Energy of a Particle Measured by an Observer

Consider a particle of mass   and 4-momentum   and an observer with 4-velocity  , where the subscripts   and   stand for "particle" and "observer", respectively. The particle energy measured by the observer is

(8.1)

i.e., (minus) the projection of the particle's 4-momentum onto the 4-velocity ("time direction") of the observer, or the time component of the particle 4-momentum according to the time of this observer. To make sense of this expression note that  . Using   and   one finds that

(8.2)

In the rest frame of the observer   and  , hence

(8.3)

If, furthermore, the particle is at rest with respect to the observer we have

(8.4)

Since   is the "time direction of the observer" (i.e.,   in its rest frame), projecting   onto   corresponds to experiencing the particle's 4-momentum from the point of view of that observer. If one adopts the quantum-mechanical relations for photons  and  , then   and   so  . This is not a derivation because Special Relativity is a classical theory, but it shows that   and   are consistent with the quantum theory of light, to which Einstein himself greatly contributed with his 1905 explanation of the photoelectric effect.

## 8.3 Frequency Measured by an Observer

Consider a light source at rest in some inertial frame and another (possibly accelerated) observer moving with respect to the first one along a worldline   with 4-tangent  . Let   denote the angular frequency of light. What angular frequency   will the non-stationary (possibly accelerated) observer measure?

The angular frequency is related to the time component   of the wave 4-vector by  , so

(8.5)

Proof

We have   (if, for simplicity, the ray propagates along the  -axis; otherwise, we can always rotate the spatial axes to make this happen) and  , then

In the rest frame of the observer it is  ,  ,  , and  . Hence, it is  . This quantity is a 4-scalar and does not depend on the coordinate frame used but it does, of course, depend on the observer   chosen.

The Doppler effect discussed in the previous chapter relates the frequency emitted by the source in its rest frame with that measured by any inertial observer.

## 8.4 A More Systematic Treatment of Measurement

Special Relativity in formulated in terms of inertial observers, a serious limitation of this theory that is overcome only in General Relativity. However, accelerations and forces do exist and it is sometimes necessary to consider accelerated observers and measurements in accelerated frames (for example, a frame connected with the rotating earth in the analysis of the GPS system).

An observer traces a worldline   with 4-tangent   satisfying  . This observer carries a laboratory along its worldline, equipped with clocks, rulers, and possibly more sophisticated equipment. Measurements are referred to axes in this laboratory, with their spatial directions defined by unit vectors   plus the time direction (a tetrad). For this reason, we associate to the laboratory four orthogonal (in the 4-dimensional sense) unit 4-vectors

(8.6)

of which   describes the time direction and   describe perpendicular (in the three-dimensional sense) spatial directions in the 3-space orthogonal (in the 4-dimensional sense) to   (Fig. 8.1).

Fig. 8.1

The unit vector   coincides with the time direction of the observer (the direction of the 4-tangent to its worldline), while   are three orthogonal unit vectors in the 3-space of this observer. One spatial direction is suppressed

The three spatial vectors can be thought of as unit vectors pointing along the directions of the axes of three gyroscopes carried by the observer. The time direction   coincides with the 4-velocity of the observer and laboratory and

(8.7)

(8.8)

(8.9)

If the observer is inertial its worldline is not accelerated, which in Cartesian coordinates is expressed by the property

(8.10)

otherwise   for an accelerated observer.

When an observer measures 4-vectors or 4-tensors in the laboratory, it is components projected along the four axes that are measured. For example the measured energy of a particle with 4-momentum   is

(8.11)

and the 3-momentum of the particle in the  -direction is

The 4-momentum of the particle can be decomposed along the tetrad

where the index   in brackets is a tetrad index (it will always appear in brackets):

(8.12)

and where   are the components of the 4-momentum in the chosen tetrad (tetrad components).

We can introduce the tetrad tensor  which operates only on the tetrad indices, its inverse   and, for any 4-vector   decomposed along the tetrad , the tetrad components are   and

(8.13)

The tetrad components of a tensor are obtained by projecting it on the tetrad basis, for example the tetrad components of a 4-vector   are

(8.14)

and those of a 2-tensor   are

(8.15)

Tetrad indices can be raised and lowered with   and  . For the 4-momentum of a particle,   is the energy of the particle, while  ,  , and  .

Example 8.1

Consider a particle at rest in an inertial frame and an observer moving with velocity   with respect to that frame in standard configuration. The observer sees the particle moving with velocity   in his/her own frame. In the rest frame of the particle, the particle 4-momentum is simply   and the observer has 4-velocity

(8.16)

The energy of the particle measured by the observer is

so   in the frame of the observer, a result that we already know.

## 8.5 The 3+1 Splitting

There is a coordinate-invariant way of slicing Minkowski spacetime into the 3-dimensional space and the time "seen" by an arbitrary (timelike) observer with 4-velocity  . One writes the Minkowski metric as

(8.17)

by defining

(8.18)

  has the meaning of 3-dimensional Riemannian metric on the 3-dimensional space of the observer characterized by its 4-velocity  . In fact   is orthogonal to  :

(8.19)

and is symmetric.

Proof

We have

The mixed tensor   is a projection operator (or projector) onto the 3-dimensional space orthogonal to the time direction   of the observer. Any 4-vector   can be decomposed into a part parallel to   and a part orthogonal to it (Fig. 8.2):

(8.20)

(obviously lying in the direction identified by  ) and

(8.21)

Let us check that   is orthogonal to  : we have

and

hence

(8.22)

In the slow-motion limit   it is

in Cartesian coordinates, so   reduces to the purely spatial Euclidean metric of 3-dimensional space. In this limit  .

The splitting of a 4-vector   into a part parallel and a part orthogonal (in the 4-dimensional sense) to the 4-velocity   of an observer

The projection onto   of a derivative of a function   ("time derivative") becomes

(8.23)

and the "spatial gradient"   of   becomes

because

(8.24)

in this limit.

## 8.6 Conclusion

We can now end this more formal but conceptually important chapter discussing measurements in Special Relativity. It is now clear that physical quantities measured in simple experiments are not just components of tensors but, rather, quantities which are invariant under coordinate transformations. They do, of course, depend on the choice of observer who is characterized by his or her 4-velocity  , a geometric object. We have also given a formal description of the 3-space "seen" by an (inertial or accelerated) observer. Often, but not always, matter is characterized by a special family of observers, those for which the matter distribution is at rest. This is the case, for example, of perfect fluids studied in the next chapter.

Abstract

We have studied the Lorentzian geometry of Minkowski spacetime, the arena in which things happen, and the kinematics and dynamics of massive and massless particles. It is now time to explore the laws ruling various forms of mass-energy and their physics in the 4-dimensional world. A fundamental role for any form of matter is played by its stress-energy tensor, which is introduced below. After general considerations we discuss the fluid dynamics of perfect fluids and then we study the scalar field and the electromagnetic field.

Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.

## 9.1 Introduction

We have studied the Lorentzian geometry of Minkowski spacetime, the arena in which things happen, and the kinematics and dynamics of massive and massless particles. It is now time to explore the laws ruling various forms of mass-energy and their physics in the 4-dimensional world. A fundamental role for any form of matter is played by its stress-energy tensor, which is introduced below. After general considerations we discuss the fluid dynamics of perfect fluids and then we study the scalar field and the electromagnetic field.

## 9.2 The Energy-Momentum Tensor

It is important to remember that Special Relativity does not describe gravity, which is completely ignored in this theory. Therefore, all the matter distributions considered in the following do not gravitate, i.e., they are considered to be test matter: they do not generate an appreciable gravitational field. This is a reasonable approximation in many situations. After all, when studying electromagnetism or nuclear or particle physics, we ignore gravity completely.

We already know how to describe single massive and massless particles and distributions of point particles in Special Relativity. We now want to consider continuous distributions of matter and fields, systems with an infinite number of degrees of , as opposed to systems of point particles which only have a finite number of degrees of freedom.1

A continuous matter distribution (including a field) in Special Relativity is by a symmetric tensor   called stress-energy tensor or energy-momentum tensor

(9.1)

This tensor will describe continuous distributions of energy such as fluids, continuous media, or fields which we expect to possess energy density, momentum density, and internal stresses. Before we proceed, a geometric consideration is in order. A timelike 4-vector   admits a unique frame in which all its spatial components   are zero  . A spacelike 4-vector admits no frame in which all its spatial components are zero. By contrast, a symmetric tensor   admits one, none, or many frames in which the time-space components   ( ) are zero. For timelike matter described by a symmetric 2-tensor   it is assumed that there exists a frame in which all the components   vanish (as we will see, these components describe the momentum density of this matter). Consider now an observer with 4-velocity   (in short, "an observer  "):

  * the energy density   of the matter distribution is obtained by projecting   onto   twice:

(9.2)

this is the energy per unit volume as measured by this observer. Remembering the equivalence of mass and energy, a mass density   corresponds to an energy density  . "Reasonable" matter is believed to have non-negative energy density  .

  * Let   be a unit 4-vector orthogonal to the 4-velocity of the observer (a purely spatial vector in the rest frame of this observer),  . Then   identifies a spatial direction with respect to this observer. The momentum flux density in the   direction (times  ) is the 4-vector

(9.3)

Up to the factor  , this is the momentum flowing per unit time and per unit of area normal to the direction   with respect to the observer. In general, by letting the vector   vary spanning all the three spatial directions orthogonal to  , one obtains the 4-vector

(9.4)

(the energy 4-current density times  ).

  * Let   and   be two spatial vectors orthogonal to  ; then

(9.5)

is the  –  component of the stress-energy tensor of the matter distribution. In other words, if we are in the frame of the observer   and we consider only the spatial indices,   ( ) is a 3-dimensional tensor identified with the stress tensor of the material (or field).

## 9.3 Covariant Conservation

In general, for any continuous matter distribution or field in Minkowski space in Cartesian coordinates, mass-energy conservation is described by

(9.6)

(the proof of the equivalence between the two equations is left as an exercise), where   is the symmetric energy momentum tensor describing that form of matter (for visualization think of this matter as a perfect fluid).

Consider a family of inertial observers with parallel 4-velocities   defined throughout spacetime. Since they are inertial (non-accelerated) observers it is   in these coordinates. In fact,

with   implies  . Now define the energy 4-current density "seen" by these observers as

(9.7)

Then Eq. (9.6) implies that

therefore,

(9.8)

(4-current conservation). This is a local conservation equation which can be translated into a global conservation statement as follows. Consider two instants of time   and   and all 3-dimensional physical space at these times (Fig. 9.1).

Fig. 9.1

Two hypersurfaces of constant time   and  . The unit normal   is parallel to the surface element   and points outward (in the direction of time at   and in the opposite direction at  )

Apply Gauss' theorem to the 4-dimensional simply connected volume   bounded by the surfaces   and by spatial infinity,

(9.9)

where   is the 3-dimensional boundary of the 4-dimensional region  . Any physically meaningful distribution of energy is localized, in the sense that   goes to zero at spatial infinity,2 therefore the contributions to the integral   come only from the time hypersurfaces3   and  . Since the unit normal   to the hypersurface   (with  ) is pointing outward, it is opposite to the time direction at the surface  , or     and

Moreover, it is

(9.10)

so Eqs. (9.8) and (9.9) yield   which, in turn, gives

(9.11)

or, the total energy contained in space at any instant of time   is equal to the total energy in space at any later time   (conservation of mass-energy). This argument applies to arbitrary timelike observers  .

Fig. 9.2

A spacetime region limited by a worldtube and its intersections with surfaces of constant time   and

The covariant conservation equation   has also more local consequences. If we integrate it over a finite, simply connected, closed 4-volume   with finite 3-dimensional boundary   (Fig. 9.2), it is

(9.12)

Let   be the outer unit normal to the 3-surface  , then

(9.13)

which tells us that the energy change of the matter distribution between top and bottom of   equals the time-integrated energy flux into the volume (i.e., the contribution from the "sides" of  )—this is conservation of energy for the 4-volume  .

An important fact is that

the covariant conservation equation   contains the equations of motion of the matter described by  .

This statement will be explained in applications to specific forms of matter such as perfect fluids and scalar and electromagnetic fields in the following sections.

Let   be a 3-dimensional volume in physical space, then

(9.14)

is the 4-momentum of the mass-energy in   if

Then

(9.15)

is a 4-vector. This vector will be timelike or null under certain conditions, called energy conditions. There are various energy conditions which can be assumed to be satisfied by what we believe is "reasonable" matter; they essentially exclude the possibility of stresses which are too large compared with the energy density of matter (for example, they exclude a fluid which has pressure but no energy density) and of spacelike energy flows.

## 9.4   Energy Conditions

Here we summarize the point-wise and averaged energy conditions of relativity.4 The energy conditions satisfied by a specific form of matter are formulated in terms of the stress-energy tensor   that describes it. In many situations it is meaningful to describe matter as a perfect fluid, which is characterized by the particular form (9.30) of the stress-energy tensor and has energy density   and pressure  . Here we use such a fluid to illustrate the physical meaning of the energy conditions. Violations of the various energy conditions are usually associated with exotic forms of matter (such as those which are suspected to occur in wormholes or in cosmology) or with quantum fields.

  * The weak energy condition is satisfied if

(9.16)

For the fluid (9.30) this condition is equivalent to

(9.17)

  * The dominant energy condition is satisfied if the weak energy condition is satisfied and, in addition,   is a null or timelike 4-vector (i.e.,  ) for any timelike 4-vector  . For the perfect fluid (9.30) this condition means that

(9.18)

or that the speed at which energy flows in this form of matter (as experienced by any material observer) does not exceed the speed of light.

  * The null energy condition consists of

(9.19)

For the perfect fluid (9.30) this requirement means

(9.20)

  * The null dominant energy condition consists of

(9.21)

This condition is the same as the dominant energy condition but here   is a null instead of timelike 4-vector. For the perfect fluid (9.30) this condition means

(9.22)

  * The strong energy condition consists of

(9.23)

For the perfect fluid (9.30) this requirement is equivalent to

(9.24)

The conditions above are point-wise energy conditions, which are imposed at each spacetime point. There are also energy conditions averaged over causal spacetime curves:

  * The averaged weak energy condition consists of

(9.25)

for all timelike non-accelerated curves (geodesics) with 4-tangent   and proper time  .

  * The averaged null energy condition consists of

(9.26)

for all null non-accelerated curves with 4-tangent   and affine parameter .

On short time scales, quantum systems are expected to violate all of the energy conditions, including positivity of the energy density.5

## 9.5 Angular Momentum

Consider an isolated distribution of mass-energy in a Cartesian inertial frame and let   be the origin event. Let   be a simply connected closed volume of 3-dimensional space at time   and let   be the worldtube determined by the surfaces  ,  , and by the "side" described by the spacetime evolution of the boundary   of   (Fig. 9.2). The angular momentum tensor of the distribution is defined as

(9.27)

where   is the position vector of the volume element  in the mass-energy distribution with respect to a fixed origin of the coordinates. Let us consider an arbitrary constant tensor   and apply the Gauss theorem to the 4-vector   on the 4-volume  , obtaining

We have

where the last two quantities in brackets in the last line are equal to zero because of covariant conservation. Therefore,

where the integral on the "side" is zero because   vanishes there. Since the outward unit normal   points in the positive  -direction at   and in the negative  -direction at  , we have

(9.28)

and

(9.29)

i.e.,

the angular momentum of an isolated distribution of mass-energy is conserved.

## 9.6 Perfect Fluids

A perfect fluid is a continuous distribution of matter with an energy-momentum tensor of the form

(9.30)

where   is a unit timelike vector   representing the 4-velocity of the fluid,   is the energy density, and   is the fluid pressure. The name "energy density" given to   is consistent with the previous definition of this quantity as   provided that we choose an observer comoving with the fluid "particles" (or volume elements), i.e.,  . Then it is

and

This matter distribution is a "perfect" fluid because only the 4-velocity, pressure, and density appear in its description and no heat conduction or viscosity terms are present. In a frame comoving with the fluid,6 in Cartesian coordinates, it is

(9.31)

and, therefore,

(9.32)

From this form of   it is clear that the fluid is spatially isotropic—there is a single pressure  , a triply degenerate eigenvalue of  , and there are no tangential pressures. The 3-dimensional stress tensor   of the perfect fluid is diagonal in the comoving frame of this fluid. The trace   is

(9.33)

(this quantity is a world scalar and assumes the same value in all coordinate systems, although here we used Cartesian coordinates to evaluate it). Therefore, remembering that   is the equation of state of a bath of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium in a cavity,

the radiation equation of state   corresponds to vanishing trace  .

The stress-energy tensor of a perfect fluid is locally isotropic in the frame with the fluid (the longitudinal stresses are all equal to   in this frame) and there are no tangential stresses   (  with  ) due to the absence of viscosity.

### 9.6.1 Equation of Motion of the Perfect Fluid

The equation of motion of a fluid in the absence of external forces and in Cartesian coordinates is

(9.34)

(covariant conservation equation). This name is given to Eq. (9.34) because it contains the conservation of mass-energy and momentum. To see this fact we need to project Eq. (9.34) onto time and 3-space.

First write down   explicitly:

or

(9.35)

Then project this equation onto  :

or

Now use  , where   is the proper time of the comoving observer (or of fluid particles), to obtain

(9.36)

In the non-relativistic limit  ,   (Newtonian time) it is

(9.37)

In this limit Eq. (9.37) reduces to

(9.38)

Equation (9.38) is the continuity equation of non-relativistic fluid mechanics expressing the local conservation of mass. Therefore, Eq. (9.36) generalizes the conservation equation but:

  *   is the energy density, not the mass density.

  * Instead of  , the combination   appears in the second term on the left hand side of Eq. (9.36), which tells us that pressure and, in general, stresses, are a form of energy density in Special Relativity and will contribute to inertia and to the energy balance of a physical system.

Now project Eq. (9.35) onto the 3-space orthogonal to   using  :

but

(in other words,   is purely spatial and projecting it onto 3-space has no effect,  ). Then it is

(9.39)

This equation generalizes the Euler equation  of non-relativistic fluid mechanics (Newton's second law for a fluid). In fact in the slow-motion limit   it reduces to

(9.40)

or

Since   we have  , therefore,

(9.41)

Equation (9.39) tells us again that pressure is a form of energy density and contributes to inertia together with   in this special-relativistic version of  .

A perfect fluid is not completely specified by the form (9.30) of the stress-energy tensor but one must also assign an equation of state, i.e., a thermodynamic relation   between pressure  , energy density  , and temperature  . Fluids with different equations of state differ wildly in their physical characteristic and behaviours. If the equation of state is of the simple form

(9.42)

it is called a barotropic equation of state. A barotropic equation of state may take the even simpler form

(9.43)

where   is called equation of state parameter. Barotropic equations of state which are widely used in relativity include:

  *   (dust), which describes a fluid of non-interacting particles with no pressure and zero pressure gradient. There is no force acting on the fluid particles, which have no proper motions and move in unison. Admittedly, this kind of rarified fluid is a rather artificial model in ordinary situations but it does have its uses in relativity and cosmology.

  *   (radiation). This is the equation of state of a gas of incoherent photons in a blackbody cavity in thermal equilibrium and is derived in statistical mechanics. It can be described as the equation of state of a random distribution of photons or massless particles in its rest frame (the only one in which it is random).

More exotic equations of state are also used. For example the stiff equation of state   is believed to be appropriate for the description of matter at nuclear densities in the core of neutron stars, and quantum vacuum is described by the equation of state  .

## 9.7 The Scalar Field

Many fields are considered in physics: you are probably familiar with the electromagnetic field represented by the vectors   and   (or, alternatively, by the scalar and vector potentials   and  ). There are also fields representing the nuclear interactions, particles with spin (spinor fields), the various particles of the particle zoo, the gravitational field, the Higgs boson, etc. Restricting ourselves to classical fields, the simplest one is the scalar field. Although no classical scalar fields are known to exist in nature, quantum scalar fields are found to represent the Higgs boson, certain mesons in quantum mechanics, and fundamental and effective scalar fields are encountered in particle physics, condensed matter, cosmology, string theories, and extended theories of gravity [7–10]. Classically, a scalar field is a real function7 of the coordinates   that transforms as a scalar ( ) under coordinate transformations  . Many scalar fields relevant for particle physics and cosmology obey the Klein-Gordon equation

(9.44)

where   is the mass of the field (which could possibly be zero),   is the reduced Planck constant, and   in Cartesian coordinates. This linear equation is well-known in field theory. The stress-energy tensor of the scalar field is

(9.45)

This energy-momentum tensor is manifestly symmetric,  . Note that   is quadratic in the first order derivatives of   with respect to time and space and it contains only first order derivatives in

("kinetic" terms), and contains a term   quadratic in   ("potential" term). To be more precise, consider the vector

(9.46)

if   we can define the vector

(9.47)

Let us assume that   is timelike; then   and by projecting   twice onto   we obtain the energy density

The first term can be seen as a "kinetic" energy density of   and the second term as a "potential" energy density. A point particle analogy would be a particle moving in one dimension with unit mass, position  , kinetic energy  , and harmonic potential  . In fact, if the field   depends only on the time   (as in the case of cosmology in General Relativity), , then it is

which is reminiscent of the energy of a particle with unit mass and position   subject to a harmonic force.

The covariant conservation equation (9.6) contains the equation of motion for  , which is the Klein-Gordon equation (9.44). In fact we have, in Cartesian coordinates,

so, if   (i.e., if  ) Eq. (9.6) implies

The Klein-Gordon equation can be generalized to a non-linear equation. By writing the term   as   and regarding   as a potential energy density, it is possible to conceive of functions   that are not quadratic, and these are indeed motivated by high energy physics and condensed matter physics. In this case the stress-energy tensor of the scalar field is generalized to

(9.48)

and the covariant conservation equation  then yields the equation of motion

(9.49)

where, as usual,   in Cartesian coordinates.

## 9.8 The Electromagnetic Field

In Special Relativity the spatial vector fields   (electric field) and   (magnetic field) of Maxwell's theory are combined into a 2-index antisymmetric tensor   (Maxwell tensor). This unified description is necessary because   and  , separately, do not transform as 4-vectors but   transforms as a true tensor. To realize this property, consider an inertial observer   who sees an electric charge at rest. For this observer there is a Coulomb electric field but no magnetic field,   and  . Another inertial observer   moving with constant velocity   with respect to   in a generic direction8 will see a charge moving with velocity   (a current) and will measure a magnetic field  . Therefore, electric and magnetic fields are not invariant but their components are mixed by a Lorentz transformation, in the same way that space and time are mixed in a change of inertial frame. The Maxwell tensor  combines both electric and magnetic fields and is antisymmetric,

(9.50)

therefore, it has six independent components (three components for   and three for  ). In fact, since electric and magnetic field mix under Lorentz transformations and must be described by the same tensorial quantity, the simplest such object is a 2-index tensor. But a tensor, in general, has sixteen independent components (ten if the tensor is symmetric), therefore it must be antisymmetric to reduce to six independent components in all frames and avoid introducing extra unphysical degrees of freedom into Maxwell's theory.

These properties are sufficient to define the   tensor which, in Cartesian , assumes the form

(9.51)

Because the components of   are mixed up by a Lorentz transformation, in general electric and magnetic fields get converted into each other in a change of inertial frame. Electric and magnetic fields are not 4-vectors and, like space and time, they do not have a separate identity. They depend on the state of motion of the observer who measures them because they are both components of a tensor which transforms with the usual tensor law. This fact is another manifestation of the 4-dimensional nature of the world. One can verify, using Eq. (9.51), that the 3-dimensional electric and magnetic fields measured by an observer with timelike 4-velocity   are given by

(9.52)

(9.53)

It is clear from these formulas that the electric and magnetic fields are not absolute entities but depend on the observer who is measuring them (who is characterized by the 4-velocity  ) and on his or her state of motion.

The Maxwell equations expressed in terms of   take the form

(9.54)

(9.55)

in Cartesian coordinates, where   is the 4-current density. The last equation can be written also as

(9.56)

where   is the dual of  . For a charge distribution with charge density  , velocity  , and current density  , the 4-current density has components

(9.57)

The charge density   in any frame can be related to the charge density   in the rest frame of this charge distribution, in which   and  , by  , which follows from the relation between 3-dimensional coordinate volume and proper volume (1.​32). In the rest frame it is

The 4-current density  is conserved,

(9.58)

which has the meaning of local conservation of electric charge. In fact, the antisymmetry of   implies that  , hence9

In 3-dimensional notation the conservation equation (9.58) is written as

(9.59)

the familiar continuity equation of electromagnetism expressing local conservation of electric charge. It is rather straightforward to verify, by listing all the components of Eqs. (9.54) and (9.55), that the 3-dimensional Maxwell equations (1.​12)–(1.​15) are reproduced.

A charge moving in an electromagnetic field is subject to the Lorentz force (1.​16). In four dimensions this law is generalized as follows: let   be the 4-velocity of the particle with mass   and charge  . Then its equation of motion is

(9.60)

where   in Cartesian coordinates. The stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field which reproduces the 4-dimensional Maxwell equations is

(9.61)

and is symmetric   and traceless ( ). The time–time component is

(9.62)

while the time–space components form the 3-vector

(9.63)

which is the Poynting vector describing the 3-momentum density of the electromagnetic field.

If  , then   is covariantly conserved,  , expressing conservation of energy for the Maxwell field. If  , this is no longer true because the field and the charge and current distributions exchange energy and momentum. In this case, one should write down a total stress-energy tensor composed of (9.61) and of a   for the charges and currents. Then it is the total   which is covariantly conserved.

The fact that   implies that there exists a 4-vector field   (called 4-vector potential or simply 4-potential) such that

(9.64)

(this combination is manifestly antisymmetric). The 4-vector potential contains as components the usual 3-dimensional scalar and vector potentials   and  :

(9.65)

Then the Maxwell equation (9.55) is just an identity in the 4-potential  . Instead of reasoning on the Maxwell tensor   we can reason on  . In Cartesian coordinates the Maxwell equation (9.54) in terms of   becomes

(9.66)

The theory has gauge freedom, that is, one can equivalently consider multiple vector potentials   which reproduce the same Maxwell tensor   and the same physics. We say that the 4-potential   is a gauge-dependent quantity, while the field   is gauge-independent. More precisely, we can add to   the gradient of a scalar function   (gauge function),

(9.67)

and this change leaves  , and therefore the Maxwell equations expressed in terms of it, unchanged:

In 3-dimensional language the gauge transformation (9.67) is equivalent to

(9.68)

(9.69)

We can use this gauge freedom to simplify the Maxwell equations (9.66) in terms of  . Choose the gauge function   in such a way that10

(9.70)

This condition can be achieved as follows: Eq. (9.67) gives that

hence, it is sufficient to choose   as a solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation

(9.71)

which is always possible.11 In 3-dimensional notation the Lorentz gauge (9.70) reads

(9.72)

In the Lorentz gauge, the Maxwell equations for   simplify to

(9.73)

the inhomogeneous wave equation. Outside of the distributions of charges and currents the 4-potential satisfies the homogeneous wave equation  , the solutions of which are Fourier superpositions of monochromatic plane waves

(9.74)

where the constant amplitude   is the polarization vector and   is the phase of the wave. The phase  obeys the equations

(9.75)

(9.76)

(9.77)

i.e., the phase  satisfies the homogeneous wave equation and its gradient   is a null 4-vector orthogonal to the amplitude 4-vector  . Equation (9.77) expresses the transversality of electromagnetic waves.

Proof

Insert Eq. (9.74) into the wave equation  . This yields

and

Taking the real part of this equation one obtains  , while taking the imaginary part gives  . Now,   must satisfy also the Lorentz gauge (9.70) or

which implies the transversality condition  , concluding the proof.

The angular frequency of a monochromatic wave measured by an observer with 4-velocity   is

(9.78)

where   is the wave 4-vector which satisfies

(9.79)

(9.80)

(9.81)

and also

(9.82)

("geodesic equation" in Cartesian coordinates). Equation (9.82) expresses the fact that   is tangent to a null "geodesic", i.e., a non-accelerated curve of extremal length according to the metric  .

For plane waves, the phase has the form

(9.83)

with   constant:

(9.84)

and the general solution of the wave equation is a Fourier superposition of plane waves

(9.85)

The Lorentz gauge (9.70) is most convenient to study radiation problems. Other gauges are possible and are used: for example the Coulomb gauge

(9.86)

is widely used in static situations. The Coulomb gauge is ruined by a Lorentz boost and, to be restored, it needs a gauge transformation to be performed in the new inertial frame after the Lorentz transformation. By contrast, the Lorentz gauge (9.70) is Lorentz-invariant.

Since the Maxwell field is described by the 4-vector  , it couples to vectorial sources and a (time-varying) dipole moment, and electromagnetic radiation is dipole to lowest order.12

We would now be ready to begin studying electrodynamics problems such as the generation of electromagnetic fields by moving charges, the scattering of charged particles, their interaction with given electromagnetic fields, and their backreaction on them. We leave these problems for more advanced textbooks [11–13], contenting ourselves with providing some basic notions here.

## 9.9 Conclusion

From the point of view of Special Relativity, different branches of physics deal with different forms of mass-energy living in Minkowski spacetime. The relevant physical quantities and the equations that they obey must be formulated in a covariant way in the 4-dimensional world. Determining the appropriate energy-momentum tensor is a crucial step in this direction.

We have discussed perfect fluids, the simplest field (the scalar field), and the Maxwell field. Ultimately, quantum matter is also described by relativistic theories. Although most atomic and molecular physics encountered in standard textbooks does not require relativity or only requires small relativistic corrections to non-relativistic quantum mechanics,13 fields do require a relativistic formulation. Dirac provided the first relativistic theory of the quantum electron and the relativistic quantum theory of the electromagnetic field (quantum electrodynamics or, in short, QED) followed. The nuclear interactions require a relativistic description, and so does any theory of higher energy physics. Gravity is discussed relativistically in Einstein's theory of General Relativity but we do not yet have a satisfactory theory of gravity which is both relativistic and quantum-mechanical.

Abstract

Thus far we have limited ourselves to studying Special Relativity using Cartesian coordinates to cover Minkowski spacetime and you are probably sick of the phrase "the equation is ... in Cartesian coordinates" and are wondering why we are not discussing equations in general coordinate systems as we did in Chap.4. There is no a priori reason to adopt Cartesian coordinates, only they allow greater mathematical simplicity tailored to the beginner. It is time to re-examine Special Relativity using arbitrary coordinates  . They involve a little more mathematics and this is the reason why they were put off until now. After generalizing the geometrical formulation of Minkowski spacetime to arbitrary coordinate systems, we will revisit the laws of motion of particles and the physics of various forms of mass-energy in this spacetime. We will conclude by briefly introducing some of the basic ideas of General Relativity.

The important thing is not to stop questioning.

## 10.1 Introduction

Thus far we have limited ourselves to studying Special Relativity using Cartesian coordinates to cover Minkowski spacetime and you are probably sick of the phrase "the equation is ... in Cartesian coordinates" and are wondering why we are not discussing equations in general coordinate systems as we did in Chap. . There is no a priori reason to adopt Cartesian coordinates, only they allow greater mathematical simplicity tailored to the beginner. It is time to re-examine Special Relativity using arbitrary coordinates  . They involve a little more mathematics and this is the reason why they were put off until now. After generalizing the geometrical formulation of Minkowski spacetime to arbitrary coordinate systems, we will revisit the laws of motion of particles and the physics of various forms of mass-energy in this spacetime. We will conclude by briefly introducing some of the basic ideas of General Relativity.

In an arbitrary coordinate system the components of the Minkowski metric are not   but general components  . The Minkowski metric tensor, however, has an existence independent of its components in a particular coordinate system. In general, the metric   will not be diagonal in an arbitrary coordinate system. If   is a transformation from Cartesian to arbitrary coordinates, the new metric components will be

In order to proceed we need to generalize the notion of ordinary and partial derivative and introduce covariant differentiation. We have already seen that, if   is a scalar function of the coordinates,   is a covariant 4-vector but   is not a covariant 4-tensor. In general, if   is a 4-vector,   is not a tensor of type   and, more generally, the partial derivative of a tensor is not a tensor. This fact can be appreciated by computing the transformation law for  . We have

Because of the second term in the last line,   does not transform as a tensor of type  , except for linear coordinate transformations. We need to generalize the concept of derivative of a tensor so that an object such as   (where   will be the new derivative operator) transforms as a true tensor.

If we consider only Cartesian coordinates and linear coordinate transformations, such as the Lorentz transformation in standard configuration, then   and   does transform as a tensor under these special coordinate changes. However, these conditions are too restrictive.

## 10.2 The Covariant Derivative

One can introduce the covariant derivative operator in Minkowski spacetime (or, in general, on a manifold   describing the curved spacetime of General Relativity and endowed with a metric tensor  ) by using an axiomatic approach.

Let   denote the space of smooth tensor fields of type   on  , let   be the tangent space to   (this is the space of all vectors in spacetime seen as operators on functions),   be the space of tensors of rank  , and   be the space of smooth functions on an open region  .

Definition 10.1

A covariant derivative operator is a map

which takes each differentiable tensor field of type   into a tensor field of type   and satisfies the following properties:

1.

Linearity:

2.

Leibnitz property

 ,  ,

3.

Commutation with contraction:

 ,

4.

Consistency with the notion of directional derivative on a scalar:

 ,  ,

5.

Torsion-free property:

 ,

(second covariant derivatives of a scalar commute).

In general, infinitely many covariant derivative operators can be defined but, if a metric tensor   is present, it determines a preferred covariant derivative operator. This operator is the one that satisfies the property

(10.1)

It can be shown that an operator with the property (10.1) is unique. The operator   is called covariant derivative operator and applying it on a tensor   results in the operation called covariant differentiation and produces the covariant derivative   of that tensor. Of course, once a covariant differentiation operator   is defined, one can take successive covariant derivatives  of a tensor field  .

### 10.2.1 Computing Covariant Derivatives

We are interested in practical rules to compute covariant derivatives, which we list here without proof (for a proof see Refs. [1, 2]). In order to covariantly differentiate vectors and tensors, one must first introduce the connection coefficients

(10.2)

where a comma denotes partial differentiation, i.e.,  , etc. By construction, we have the symmetry

(10.3)

The   are not tensors since they do not transform as such under coordinate transformations. Their transformation property under a coordinate change   is instead

(10.4)

(the derivation of this transformation law is left as an exercise).

The covariant derivative of a contravariant vector field   is

(10.5)

i.e., the ordinary derivative plus an additional term constructed with the connection coefficients and the vector field itself. Note that in this additional term the contravariant index   of the 4-vector is "stolen" by the  -symbol. The positive sign with which the second term on the right hand side enters the expression of   is strictly associated with the contravariant nature of the index   in  . By contrast, the covariant derivative of a covariant vector field   is

(10.6)

(note the negative sign of the second term on the right hand side). Using Eq. (10.4) it is straightforward to verify that   transforms as a tensor of type   and   transforms as a tensor of type  .

The rules for computing covariant derivatives extend to all covariant and contravariant indices of a tensor field  :

(10.7)

Again, using Eqs. (10.4) and (10.7), it is straightforward to check that the covariant derivatives  transform as true tensors under coordinate transformations.

In Cartesian coordinates in Minkowski spacetime it is   and the connection coefficients vanish identically,

(10.8)

hence, in Cartesian coordinates, the covariant derivative reduces to an ordinary derivative,  , with obvious formal simplifications and this is the reason why we have mostly used Cartesian coordinates until this chapter.

## 10.3 Spacetime Curves and Covariant Derivative

Let   be a spacetime curve parametrized by a parameter   and with 4-tangent  . We are interested in timelike and null curves, which are the 4-trajectories of physical particles. For timelike curves we adopt the parameter  , where   is the proper time along the curve1 and the tangent to the curve is the 4-velocity

(10.9)

The derivative of a tensor field   along the curve is defined as

(10.10)

i.e., as the projection of the covariant derivative of the tensor along the direction of the curve (the direction of its tangent).

### 10.3.1 Geodesics

Definition 10.2

A geodesic curve is a curve of zero acceleration  , or

(10.11)

This definition requires that the variation of the tangent   in the direction of the curve vanishes. Since

a geodesic curve obeys the geodesic equation

(10.12)

In Cartesian coordinates the connection coefficients vanish identically,  , and the geodesic equation reduces to

which has the linear solution  , where   and   are constants determined by the initial conditions   and   at an initial value   of the parameter. Therefore,

the geodesics of Minkowski spacetime are straight lines.

A property of geodesics is that of being curves that extremize the length between two points. It is well known that the minimum length between two points in   with Euclidean metric is obtained by following the straight line joining them. This property holds true also in Minkowski spacetime and can be obtained (as in the Euclidean case) using the calculus of variations [3–5].

In actual fact the form of the geodesic equation can be more general than (10.11). A geodesic can be defined more generally as a curve such that its tangent is transported parallel to itself when moving along the geodesic, that is

(10.13)

where   is a constant, or

(10.14)

This equation expresses the fact that the change of the tangent vector   in the direction of the curve is parallel to   itself, i.e., this vector is transported parallel to itself when moving along the curve.

As for all curves, many parametrizations can be chosen for the same geodesic. A particular class of parameters, called affine parameters, is such that Eq. (10.13) reduces to the simpler form (10.11), which is called affinely parametrized form. Non-affinely parametrized geodesics are still curves of extremal length, only their parameters are non-affine.2

Definition 10.3

A vector   is a geodesic vector if it is tangent to a geodesic, i.e., if it satisfies Eq. (10.11) or Eq. (10.13).

## 10.4 Physics in Minkowski Spacetime Revisited

Let us revisit now the physics in Minkowski spacetime discussed in Chaps. – using arbitrary coordinate systems instead of restricting ourselves to Cartesian coordinates. The rule to generalize Cartesian coordinates is to replace partial derivatives of tensors with covariant derivatives, the "delta-to-nabla" rule . As we already know, covariant and partial derivatives coincide for a scalar function in arbitrary coordinate systems,  , so we only need to worry about 4-vectors and 4-tensors with two or more indices. The d'Alembertian of a scalar function   is defined as

(10.15)

This quantity consists of   plus a second term:

A useful property is

(10.16)

the proof of which is left as an exercise.

Example 10.1

Compute the d'Alembertian  of a scalar field  in spherical coordinates  .

The metric in spherical coordinates is   and the inverse metric and metric determinant are   and  . The d'Alembertian of   is

where

is the well-known 3-dimensional Laplacian in spherical coordinates.

### 10.4.1 Mechanics

We have already seen that, in general coordinates, the definition of 4-velocity   remains valid but the 4-acceleration is now

(10.17)

The 4-momentum of a particle of mass   is again  , while the 4-force becomes

(10.18)

and the formula

(10.19)

remains valid because   is a scalar and has the same value in all coordinate systems, therefore it can be computed in a special one (Cartesian coordinates) without loss of generality. In particular,   for particles of constant mass.

### 10.4.2 Optics

Again, the 4-tangent to a null ray is defined as   where   is a parameter and  . The null ray is a geodesic which can be affinely parametrized. If   is an affine parameter then

(10.20)

The wave 4-vector  is introduced as done earlier and is normalized to  .

### 10.4.3 General Matter Distributions

The main change with respect to Cartesian coordinates is the covariant conservation equation for the stress-energy tensor of a matter distribution, which now reads

(10.21)

and the conservation of the 4-current density of energy becomes

(10.22)

### 10.4.4 Perfect Fluids

For a perfect fluid the equations already seen remain unchanged, except that the general covariant conservation law (10.21) projected along the 4-velocity   of the fluid now gives

(10.23)

### 10.4.5 The Maxwell Field

The Maxwell equations become

(10.24)

(10.25)

where the last equation coincides with the form

which we already know. Because of the particular combination of derivatives appearing in this equation the  -terms in the covariant derivatives cancel out. The expression of the stress-energy tensor of the Maxwell field remains the same that we have already seen. The expression of the Maxwell tensor in terms of the 4-potential coincides with the familiar one:

(10.26)

because

due to the symmetry   of the connection coefficients.

A gauge transformation can now be written as

(10.27)

which coincides with the one already known since  . The Lorentz gauge (9.​70) is written

(10.28)

The Maxwell equations for the 4-potential   in the Lorentz gauge are still

(10.29)

provided that the correct expression   of the d'Alembertian  is adopted. The solutions of these equations are of the plane wave form   with

Then the wave 4-vector is   and we have

and

## 10.5 Conclusions

We have concluded our exposition of the basics of Special Relativity and we are now acquainted also with some of the formalism which is necessary to introduce General Relativity, the generalization which includes gravity explicitly. Locally, i.e., over small regions of space and for short time intervals, General Relativity reduces to Special Relativity. The intrinsic limitation of Special Relativity of being formulated in terms of inertial observers has been overcome only partially by our occasional discussion of accelerated observers and worldlines. The restriction to inertial observers has not been eliminated completely—this is only done in General Relativity. Considering accelerations opens the door to new possibilities and, indeed, Einstein's path to General Relativity was to consider the equivalence between gravity and acceleration. That is, the effects of gravity can be eliminated locally by adopting a freely falling reference frame. Since in the absence of other forces all test particles are subject to the same universal acceleration, independent of their masses and chemical compositions (an experimental finding dating back to Galilei and called the Equivalence Principle), Einstein conceived the idea of describing gravity as a property of spacetime instead of a force. A basic assumption of General Relativity is that the gravity generated by energy distributions curves spacetime and all test particles feel this curved geometry. This geometric description is only possible because of the universality of free fall and is peculiar to gravity.

If gravity can be locally eliminated by acceleration and acceleration is equivalent to gravity, at least locally, acceleration curves the spacetime geometry as can be argued by the following argument due to Ehrenfest and originally known as the Ehrenfest paradox. Consider a disk of radius   in uniform rotation. A meter stick at rest relative to it measures the length of its circumference as  . However, an observer on the rotation axis, with respect to whom the disk is rotating with uniform angular velocity  , measures the tangential velocity   and a circumference

(10.30)

where   due to Lorentz contraction, while the transversal (radial) direction is not Lorentz-contracted.3 For this observer the ratio of the circumference to the radius is

(10.31)

as it happens in non-Euclidean geometry. This observation suggests that acceleration curves spacetime. Einstein apparently took inspiration from this example in formulating the Equivalence Principle which underlines General Relativity and states the local equivalence of gravity and acceleration. General Relativity is not based on the rigid Minkowski spacetime endowed with the Minkowski metric which we have used so far, but rather on a curved spacetime with a Lorentzian metric   which depends on the spacetime position. The details of the curvature of spacetime describe the particular gravitational field associated with a mass-energy distribution residing in that spacetime. But this is another story ...

## Problems of Chapter 1

1.1 In standard configuration, a Galilei transformation is given by

Therefore, we have

and

1.2 Differentiate the equations defining parabolic coordinates

to obtain

The 3-dimensional line element (squared) is

Therefore, the line element (squared) in parabolic coordinates is

1.3 Proceed as in the previous exercise. The answer is

1.7 In these units it is   .

1.8 It is

and Det   .

## Problems of Chapter 2

2.2 The eigenvalues are   (doubly degenerate) and

(non-degenerate). The eigendirections associated with the eigenvalue   are the   \- and   -axes. The eigendirections associated with the other two eigenvalues form the light cone. It is intuitive that all these directions are left invariant by a Lorentz transformation in standard configuration.

2.8 The angular size of the moon is   , where   is its radius and   is the earth-moon distance. Therefore, the angular velocity of the spot is

The apparent linear velocity of the laser spot on the surface of the moon is

The fact that this apparent velocity is larger than   does not constitute a problem since this is not the velocity of propagation of a particle or signal: it is merely a projection, an optical illusion.

2.9 The dispersion relation is

and the phase velocity is

The phase velocity is always larger than   and asymptotes to it as   (see Fig. A.1 ).

Fig. A.1

The phase velocity   as a function of the wave vector

The group velocity is

The group velocity   is always smaller than   and asymptotes to it as   (see Fig. A.2 ).

Fig. A.2

The group velocity   as a function of the wave vector

The geometric mean of the phase and group velocity is the speed of light: in fact,

For a monochromatic plane wave described by the electric field   with angular frequency   , the dispersion relation yields

and, therefore,

If   then the magnitude of the wave vector   is imaginary,   , and the electric field of the monochromatic plane wave is

the wave cannot propagate through the plasma because its amplitude decreases exponentially fast.

## Problems of Chapter 3

3.4 Coordinate time and proper time are related by the time dilation formula

hence, since   ,

The proper times   correspond to coordinate times

The spacetime diagram of the particle and the light cones emitted are sketched in Fig. A.3 .

Fig. A.3

The spacetime diagram of the particle of problem 3.4 and three light cones emanating from it (not to scale)

3.5 Refer to Fig. A.4 , where the past light cones of the particles are drawn.

Fig. A.4

The past light cones of the two particles do not overlap in the region   above the   -axis. Their overlap (in black ) lies below the   axis

The two particles can have interacted at times   if there is an overlap between their past light cones in the region of the   plane above the   -axis. In Fig. A.4 there is no such overlap. In Fig. A.5 , instead, the particles have interacted at times   and there is such an overlap.

Fig. A.5

Now the past light cones of the two particles do overlap in the region   above the   -axis

The condition for the particles to have interacted in the past at times   is

i.e., the particles must be close enough that in the time interval   light travels less than the separation   .

3.6 Newtonian mechanics corresponds to the limit of Special Relativity in which the speed of light becomes infinite (more rigorously: the limit   , where   is the largest speed of particles or signals). In the formal limit   , the light cones in the   Minkowski space open up and degenerate into planes parallel to the   plane (cf. Fig. A.6 ). In these planes, interactions propagate instantaneously. A light ray would take zero time to propagate between two spatial points in one of these planes. In Newtonian mechanics there is instantaneous action at distance and there is no time delay between the change of conditions at one point of space and its effects being felt at a distant point.

Fig. A.6

As   , a light cone opens up more and more until it flattens onto the plane

3.7 Use units in which   , then the world trajectory of the particle is given by

It must be   , or   and, since   at all times, we obtain   , where   is the frequency of the oscillatory motion. The upper bound on the frequency of the motion

must be satisfied.

3.8 Differentiate the relations

to obtain

Multiply the first equation by   and the second by   and subtract the second equation thus obtained from the first one. This procedure gives

Now consider again the same two equations but multiply the first by   and the second by   and subtract the first equation thus obtained from the second. The result is

The given line element is

Therefore, the given line element is nothing but the Minkowski line element in unusual coordinates. Using again the relations

it is easy to see that

and, therefore,   : the coordinates   cover only the wedge   of the 2-dimensional Minkowski space ( Rindler wedge , see Fig. A.7 ).

## Problems of Chapter 4

4.1 The coordinate transformation

is not an admissible coordinate transformation because it has zero determinant and is not one-to-one. In fact, it is of the form

with   and the determinant is

The determinant vanishes because the two equations of the transformation are not independent; by substituting the first into the second equation, one obtains     and, therefore, the entire   plane is mapped onto the line   .

4.2 We have

In order for this transformation to be an admissible coordinate transformation it must be

or

The components of the vector   obey the transformation law   . We have

hence

Alternatively, in matrix notation, we have

4.4 Use the transformation property

where   and   . We have

and the inverse coordinate transformation

from which we compute

Therefore, we have

where the components   , and   are now seen as functions of   , and   .

4.5 The Einstein summation convention means that

4.6 We have   and

which implies that

This equation can be written explicitly as

Expanding the left hand side yields

which gives

i.e.,   is antisymmetric,   . Therefore, in four dimensions,   can have only   independent components. Since the transformation   is completely specified by   , there are only six such transformations. We know that they conserve the Minkowski scalar product   and they are easily identified with three spatial rotations and three pure Lorentz boosts. Reflections cannot be connected continuously with the identity, while all the   transformations reduce to the identity   in the limit   .

4.7 We have

4.8 Under a coordinate change   , the 4-vectors transform as

and it is

Since   ,   transforms as a contravariant 2-tensor.

4.10 Consider a coordinate transformation   , then it is

hence

4.11 The Kronecker delta is

in any coordinate system. Let us show that it transforms as a tensor under coordinate changes   . We have

which is the transformation law of a   tensor.

4.12 By definition, it is   and we have

4.15 We have

and

4.18 We have

Since all the indices are dummy indices their names are not important and we can change them, obtaining

An alternative writing is

because   .

4.19 We have

and we compute

Since   is antisymmetric, also   is and   . The other components transform according to   , hence

4.20 Let   and   be 4-vectors with   and let   be a coordinate change. Then we have

4.21 Let   , then we have

4.23 On the one hand we have

On the other hand, it is

which is different from   .

4.24 Let   and   , then

4.25 We have

4.27 Using the Levi-Civita symbol   in three dimensions we have that, for the vector   , it is   and

In a similar fashion we have

4.28 The first two properties are trivial:

The Jacobi identity is verified by expanding it:

## Problems of Chapter 5

5.1 The null vectors   must satisfy   . If   , this means that

and   . The vectors   are all the null vectors of the 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

  * If   then the vector   is future-oriented.

  * If   then the vector   is past-oriented.

  * If   we have the trivial vector   .

In practice, a null vector is defined up to a multiplicative constant and we can set   for future-oriented null vectors and   for past-oriented null vectors.

5.2 We have

5.4 We have

5.6 No. As a counterexample take the 4-vectors   (which is timelike since   ) and   (which is spacelike since   ). We have

5.11 Without loss of generality, we rotate the spatial coordinate axes so that   The normalization   yields   , so   . Physical vectors are future-oriented, so we assume that   . Under a Lorentz transformation we have

Since   , it is   and since   and   , it is also   . The proof can be repeated for   and, in general,

5.12 Assume   and   or   ; then, without loss of generality, we can rotate the spatial axes to achieve   , but this contradicts the assumption that   in all frames. Hence, it must be   in all frames and   has the form   . By repeating the reasoning if   or   in all frames, we obtain the same result. Now consider a Lorentz transformation   ; in the "new" inertial frame it is

which contradicts the assumption   in all inertial frames unless   . Then, the only possibility left is that   .

Similarly, if   with   (otherwise we can rotate the spatial axes so that   ), then we have

which contradicts the assumption.

5.14 First, consider   in some frame; we have

then consider   and by the same argument we obtain

Repeat this argument for   and for   , obtaining   , respectively.

Now consider   with both   and   different from zero. We have

we then obtain   .

Next, consider   with both   and   non-vanishing; repeating the reasoning we obtain   .

Then, consider   with both   and   non-vanishing; with the same reasoning one obtains   .

Then, consider   with all of   , and   non-vanishing. We have

from which we obtain that   .

Next, taking   one obtains   and by taking   with all the components non-vanishing, one obtains   . Therefore, we have   for all values of the indices   and   .

5.15 Let   ,   , and

with   . Then consider the 4-vector

which has norm squared

Let us bound the product   : we have

since   and   are both timelike, it is

hence   ,   and

and finally

In the end we can write

Here the useful inequality is   , using which we evaluate the norm squared of   as

and   is timelike.

5.16 Let   be timelike,   be null, and   and   be isochronous. We have

and   with   . Consider the sum vector

which has norm squared

Let us study the product   : we have

and

while

Then

and   . The norm squared of   is

and   is timelike. Then we have

and   is timelike and isochronous with   (and therefore also with   ).

5.21 Let   be spacelike,   . Then there exists an inertial frame in which   . In this frame, define the timelike 4-vector   such that

The 4-vectors   and   are orthogonal,   , and

Because this is an equality between world scalars, if it is satisfied in one frame it is satisfied in any frame and we can write

Now consider the 4-vectors

clearly   and

In the frame in which   ,   it is

and   and   are isochronous in this frame, hence they are isochronous in any frame.

5.24 Let   and   be two timelike isochronous 4-vectors, then

We have   and, since   and   , it is   and   . Then we have

and

therefore   .

5.30 Let   and   be two 4-vectors. The desired quantity in the new frame is

5.32 We have

and   , hence

the surfaces   are oblate ellipsoids. Differentiation of the coordinate transformation yields

The Minkowskian line element is

Now we have

and the line element becomes

The Kerr solution of General Relativity representing the spacetime outside a rotating stationary black hole of mass   and angular moment per unit mass   (in units in which   ) is

where

(Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates). In the limit   in which gravity disappears, General Relativity reduces to Special Relativity and this spacetime must reduce to the Minkowski spacetime. This is indeed the case because, in this limit,

which is the Minkowskian line element in rotating coordinates found above.

## Problems of Chapter 6

6.1 We have

The particle 4-velocity is proportional to   , which is a timelike 4-vector, hence   is timelike and can be associated with a massive particle. To find   , we normalize   because the 4-velocity of a massive particle must satisfy   . Hence, setting   , it must be

which implies that   . Therefore, the particle 4-velocity is

6.6 Working in Cartesian coordinates, we have

Since   where   is the proper time of the particle and

while   . Therefore, it is

6.7 We have

and   is the linear velocity of the particle. The worldline is a helix with the time axis as the symmetry axis (Fig. A.8 ).

Fig. A.8

The worldline of the particle of problem 6.7 is a helix

Since   must be smaller than   , the bound

must be obeyed.

The proper time   is related to the coordinate time   by the time dilation formula   , where

is the Lorentz factor. Since   is constant, it is

A parametric representation of the particle worldline is

6.8 In the instantaneous rest frame of the particle (which is an inertial frame) it is

Since   is a world scalar, it assumes the same value in all inertial frames, therefore, it vanishes in all frames.

6.12 Let

then   is the equation of the hypersurface   . The normal to   is parallel to the gradient of   :

and

The length squared of   is

It is   (and   is spacelike) if   , while   (and   is null) if   . Therefore, the hypersurface   is

  * timelike if   ;

  * null if   .

When   is timelike, the unit normal is

and

When   is null (for   ), the unit normal lies along   and has arbitrary magnitude. In this case it is

and, dropping an irrelevant factor   ,

## Problems of Chapter 7

7.4 (a) We have

We eliminate the time   using

Then we have

and

This is still the equation of a straight line but now it has slope   . In the moving frame, rain droplets make an angle with the horizontal

this angle is smaller in the relativistic case than in the non-relativistic case.

  * If   , then   and   .

  * If   , it can still be   . We have   at   , or

In the limit   we have   and   (relativistic beaming becomes extreme).

(b) Now, using the relativistic law of composition of velocities

we have

for O and

and

(c) In (a) we obtain, using   ,

hence

which coincides with the answer obtained in part (b).

## Problems of Chapter 8

8.1 We have

The vector   can be interpreted as the 4-velocity of a timelike observer, giving the direction of time for this observer, i.e., there exists a coordinate system   such that   in these coordinates.   is a spatial vector lying in the hypersurfaces   const. orthogonal to   .   is normalized to unity for convenience:   (and   ).   has the direction of the 3-momentum of the particle. We have, therefore, a (local) splitting of spacetime into 3-space and time based on the choice of (local) time   (Fig. A.9 ).

Fig. A.9

The   splitting of spacetime into space and time according to the observer with 4-velocity   .

In the rest frame of the observer with 4-velocity   , the quantity   can be interpreted as the particle energy with respect to that local frame, with   (it is   only if the particle is at rest in that local frame).

8.2 Projecting along the "time" direction (i.e., the direction of   ) one has

where   , hence

Projecting now onto the 3-space orthogonal to   with the projection operator   , one has

but, since   is purely spatial, we have

hence

is the spatial gradient of the function   .

8.4 Use units in which   . We have

Using now   , we obtain

Proceeding, we have

To summarize, the null tetrad satisfies the relations

and all the other products vanish.

We also have

Let us compute the coefficients   :

Substituting these coefficients into the expression of   yields

## Problems of Chapter 9

9.1 Since   is symmetric,   , we have

The equation   is rewritten changing the names of the dummy indices as   or as   .

9.2 In the   splitting, the spatial 3-metric   is defined by

using the 4-velocity of the fluid   . We have then

9.5 Assume that   for all timelike vectors   . Then, using the form of the perfect fluid stress-energy tensor

one obtains

or, since   ,

Now choose   , which implies that   , or

and, if   , then also   . If the pressure   is negative, it must still be

now

or

which implies that

9.6 (a) We have

(b) We have also

(c) Finally, it is

9.8 We have

Then we have

Using the fact that   , one obtains

Finally, it is

In addition, the trace-free part of   is

because the trace   vanishes.

9.9 Let us calculate the effective quantities using the fact that

We have

Now use

where   to obtain

Substituting back into the expression of   we obtain

It follows immediately that the effective energy density is given by

The purely spatial part of   is

and it is straightforward to identify the energy flux density

This identification can also be checked by using the definition

We are left with

Taking the trace and remembering that   must be trace-free, one obtains

and, finally,

Therefore, we have

9.10 The requested normalization is

and the dispersion relation is

9.11 The scalar field energy-momentum tensor is

and the trace is

9.13 Work in units in which   : the 4-vector   must be normalized to   , which gives

We now need to compute

Let   , with   ; then it is

To summarize, we have

To check that these results are correct, consider the stress-energy tensor of a perfect fluid constructed with these quantities,

9.14 It is simplest to work in Cartesian coordinates in which   is represented by the diagonal matrix

The eigenvalues are   and   , with degeneracies   and   , respectively. The associated normalized eigenvectors are   and

In fact, it is

and, if   are purely spatial unit vectors with   (for   ), then it is

For a perfect fluid with equation of state   , the stress-energy tensor degenerates to

and any 4-vector is an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue   . In fact, in this case we have

or   with   for any 4-vector   .

9.15 Remember that the Maxwell tensor is

Then, in Cartesian coordinates in which   (rest frame of the observer with 4-velocity   ) it is

and

Now compute   using   :

hence

is   .

9.16 In the frame   the Maxwell tensor is

The transformation property of   is

The inverse Lorentz transformation

yields

and

In matrix form, we have the Maxwell tensor

In the inertial frame   there is a pure electric field and no magnetic field, and this electric field is parallel to the   -axis.

9.17 The required invariant is

For the monochromatic electromagnetic wave represented by the 4-potential

it is

in the Lorentz gauge and, therefore, in any gauge because   is a gauge-invariant quantity. Then, for this wave, the electric and magnetic fields must have equal magnitudes,

The other invariant   vanishes for this monochromatic wave, implying that   is perpendicular to   (in the usual 3-dimensional sense).

9.18 The wave equation is relativistic, as it can be written in covariant form as

where the last equality holds in Cartesian coordinates, or

The heat/diffusion equation

by contrast, is non-relativistic because the time derivative of the unknown function is of only first order while the space derivatives are of second order. This feature cannot be expressed using a 4-dimensional spacetime view in which time is a dimension analogous to the three spatial dimensions. Formally, heat conduction or diffusion described by the heat equation occurs with infinite speed (a phenomenon called "heat paradox"). This feature is not a problem for ordinary applications of this equation to every day situations, but it makes the equation untenable in the relativistic regime.

## Problems of Chapter 10

10.1 We have

and

or

Now, it is

Therefore, it is

and, using the fact that   , the last term is seen to be

Putting everything together, the desired transformation property is

10.2 The identity is a trivial consequence of   . In fact, we have

from which it follows that

10.3 The geodesic equation is

Introduce a new parameter   , then

and

Impose now that with the new parameter   it is

this requirement leads to

Call   , then

Then, it must be

or

or

which gives   and

With one more integration we obtain

We can now show that, if   is an affine parameter, then any new parameter   obtained with a reparameterization   will be affine if and only if   , where   and   are constants. Use the relation between   and   already obtained, with the change   and   : then we have

but since   is affine, it is   and

where   and   are integration constants.

10.4 Using polar coordinates   related to Cartesian coordinates by

the 3-dimensional Euclidean line element is written as

On the surface of the sphere   of radius   it is   const. and   , hence the line element reduces to

The 2-dimensional metric on this sphere is given by

and its inverse by

The determinant is Det   . Let us compute the connection coefficients

It is useful to make a complete list of them before computing them:

We then apply the previous formula, obtaining

To summarize, the only non-vanishing connection coefficients are

The geodesic equation

yields, on the sphere,

where an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the (affine) parameter   . The big circles on the sphere are solutions, hence they are geodesic curves.

  * Meridians: these are curves with

The values   describe the North and South poles, which are degenerate geodesics, while the value   corresponds to the equator.

10.5 In cylindrical coordinates   the answer is

and all the other connection coefficients vanish.

In spherical coordinates   the answer is

and all the other connection coefficients vanish.

10.6 (a) In cylindrical coordinates the line element is

(b) In spherical coordinates the line element is

and (working again in units in which   ), it is

Since

where

in these coordinates   is again diagonal and

or

10.7 No. Since   , it is also   identically for all covariantly conserved forms of matter.

10.8 One can use the projection of the equation of motion   onto the 3-space orthogonal to   :

where   is the Riemannian metric on the 3-space orthogonal to   and   is the 4-acceleration of the fluid particles. For a dust,   and its gradient, which is the only force acting on the fluid, vanishes identically leaving   .

An alternative solution consists of using the equation of motion of the fluid   directly:

or

By projecting onto the direction of the 4-velocity   , one obtains

and one obtains   which, substituted back into the full equation of motion, leads to   .

10.10 Since   is null and an overall multiplicative constant (or function) does not affect its normalization, we can use   instead, obtaining

where   is a null 4-vector:   . The trace of the null dust stress energy tensor vanishes,

and

as well. The covariant conservation equation   yields

and, finally,

This is the equation of a non-affinely parametrized null geodesic with tangent   .
