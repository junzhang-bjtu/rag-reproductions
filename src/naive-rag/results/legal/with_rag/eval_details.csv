How are fees structured and adjusted under Article 6?,"Fees under Article 6 are structured to include three components for each individual system: the Individual First Phase Fee, which is calculated based on the volume of product received in barrels; the Individual Second Phase Fee, based on the volume of product delivered in barrels to the internal transfer point; and an allocation of the actual costs incurred by Midstream Co for electricity, allocated according to the aggregate volumes of product received.

Fee adjustments are made through two mechanisms. First, a redetermination process occurs annually, where between November 1 and December 31, Midstream Co provides a Redetermination Proposal to Producer to revise individual fees, unless the parties agree not to adjust specific fees. If no agreement is reached by the redetermination deadline, the current fee remains unchanged for the adjustment year. Second, effective July 1 of each year, individual fees are subject to annual escalation, which is calculated by multiplying the then-current fee by the escalation percentage. This annual increase applies even if the fee was recently redetermined, and it does not apply to reimbursed amounts.","Fees are structured based on the Individual First Phase Fee and the Individual Second Phase Fee, calculated as a product of the quantity of Product and the applicable rates.

How can the Aggregate Commitments of the Purchasers be increased under the RPA?,"The Aggregate Commitments of the Purchasers can be increased under the RPA by following a structured process. First, each Purchaser must notify the Administrative Agent within a specified time period whether it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, the amount of the increase relative to its Pro Rata Share. Purchasers who fail to respond within the time period are deemed to have declined the increase.

The Administrative Agent then notifies the Sellers and each Purchaser of the responses to the request. If the existing Purchasers do not agree to the full amount of the requested increase, the Seller Representative may invite additional financial institutions, referred to as ""New Purchasers,"" to become part of the agreement. These New Purchasers must execute a joinder agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel, and each New Purchaser’s Commitment must be at least $50,000,000, subject to the Administrative Agent’s approval (which cannot be unreasonably withheld).

Once the increase is approved, the Administrative Agent and the Sellers determine the final allocation of the increase and the effective date, known as the ""Increase Effective Date."" The Administrative Agent must notify all Sellers and Purchasers of the final allocation and the Increase Effective Date, ensuring that the Purchasers receive at least two Business Days' notice.

On the Increase Effective Date, the Asset Interests of all Purchasers—including the New Purchasers—are reallocated so that each Purchaser’s Asset Interests align with its new Pro Rata Share. This reallocation may require certain Purchasers to sell a portion of their Asset Interests to others in exchange for cash. The Administrative Agent coordinates this reallocation, and its determination is final unless there is a manifest error. The increase becomes effective only upon satisfaction of all applicable conditions.","The Aggregate Commitments can be increased by the Seller Representative requesting an increase, subject to the Purchasers' approval and the satisfaction of conditions precedent, including the payment of additional fees and the execution of necessary documents.",4.0,0.6907324075776606,1.0,1.0,1.0
