This vision deeply influenced his poetry, most notably in *Leaves of Grass*, where he expressed a democratic spirit through free verse, inclusive language, and a focus on the body, nature, and the soul. He celebrated the working class, ordinary people, and the natural world, often using ""I"" to represent the collective voice of the nation. His poetry embraced democracy not just as a political system but as a way of life—open, inclusive, and constantly evolving.","Whitman's vision for America was to make his poem embody the nation at its best. He wanted to omit nothing. Democracy at its essence is the detail, not the generalization, or at least the detail first, then the generalization; the ""I,"" because we have to begin there, and the ""we,"" and then the ""you,"" and there, in essence, the equation is done—there is, as he points out again and again, no ""they.""",4.5,0.7522143730893901,1.0
